Common pheasants were among the first to be released, in Wellington, Canterbury, Otago and Auckland from 1842-1877. They are established throughout open country in the North Island, with local populations topped up by ongoing releases by Fish &amp; Game Councils and private breeders. Numbers are lower in the South Island. Hunting of pheasants and other game birds in New Zealand is managed by Fish &amp; Game New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The common pheasant is the largest introduced upland gamebird species established in New Zealand, weighing up to 1.5 kilograms. The male is larger than the female and much more brightly coloured. The most prominent features of the male are its red facial wattle, iridescent blue-green head and neck feathers, distinctive white collar, and long, barred tail feather. The body feathers are red and brown with intricate white margins and black barring. The female is much smaller with a short tail and subtly marked brown feathers with much finer black barring.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: the male has a distinctive loud crow &#x2018;<em>kok-kok&#x2019;</em>. When flushed, the male utters a loud throaty <em>korrrk</em> alarm call.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: adult female and immature common pheasants may resemble helmeted guineafowl but lack the bony casque on the head and white-spotted grey plumage. They may also resemble weka and adult female and immature wild turkeys but are distinguished by having long tapering tail feathers and paler brown plumage. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pheasants are most abundant in the northern and western regions of the North Island. In the South Island, it is mainly found in the drier areas of Canterbury and Nelson. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In New Zealand, common pheasants inhabit a wide variety of open habitats, including grasslands, arable and pastural farmland, exotic forestry, deciduous woodland, coastal shrubland and road verges. They have a strong association with areas where ink weed is common.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand pheasant population is estimated at 250,000 birds, with about 50,000 males shot each year during the winter game-hunting season. Its numbers are augmented through releases of captive-reared birds. Pheasant numbers increased rapidly after their release, but plummeted in the 1890s following the release of ferrets and stoats and widespread laying of poisoned grain, both being measures implemented to control populations of introduced rabbits. Pheasant populations have never fully recovered.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pheasants are not recognised as having any significant economic or conservation impacts beyond being a gamebird, with flow-on benefits to suppliers of hunting equipment and licenses. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Common pheasants are solitary outside the breeding season. Males are polygamous, mating with a number of females and taking no part in nest building or incubation. The main breeding season is from October to December, but eggs have been found from July to March. The nest is a bowl-shaped indentation in grass, well hidden among vegetation. The average clutch size is 9 with a range of 7-15. Incubation takes 23-28 days; the chicks leave the nest when dry and are able to fly short distances after 12 days. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pheasants stay close to vegetation, seeking cover when disturbed. They are wary and have good eye-sight, and so provide few opportunities to observe behaviour other than threat response. When disturbed at close range, they erupt into vertical flight and fly low and swiftly until pitching back into cover. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food and feeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Common pheasants are omnivorous, feeding on foliage, seeds, grains, berries and invertebrates. Chicks mainly consume insects. Adults can dig in the ground with their beak and claws up to a depth of 8 cm.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks &#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Pheasant\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Pheasant</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/westcoast/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/pheasants/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/westcoast/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/pheasants/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Falla, R.A.; Sibson, R.B.; Turbott, E.G. 1966. <em>A field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Males are deep blue on the breast, neck, head and fan crest, and metallic green on the back and rump. The over-developed upper tail coverts have a tan, lilac and purple-brown sheen and are up to 1.4 m long. In mature males, about 140-150 feathers have &#x2018;eyes&#x2019; which are deep blue in the centre and have outer layers of metallic lighter blue, gold and metallic green. The coverts are held up by the rigid tail feathers in their characteristic display, during which the tail coverts are violently shaken.

The rest of the feathers are speckled brown.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a series of repeated crowing <em>ka</em> and shrill <em>eow </em>calls of varying frequency given up to 8 times in a row by males, primarily in the breeding season. Other distress and warning calls given throughout the year. Clucking calls are used by females with young and when pointing out food.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Peafowl have been released into the wild many times, mainly through benign neglect of birds kept for display. Peafowl are held on many lifestyle properties, and have become feral in the upper North Island, especially Northland, Auckland, East Cape and mid Hawkes Bay. The largest feral populations are in wooded lowlands and coastal farmland including the upper Wanganui River catchment, northern Mahia Peninsula and pine forests of the South Head of Kaipara Harbour. They are also present in isolated locations in Nelson, Marlborough and Canterbury. Absent from Stewart Island. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No population estimates. Peafowl are generally recorded in small mixed-sex groups of less than 10 birds in the pre-breeding season. They congregate in larger flocks during February-August. Up to 100 birds were in one field at Orere Point, Firth of Thames in April 2011, and more than 100 near Otane, central Hawke&apos;s Bay in June 2016. Other large flocks included 17 at Whakapirau, North Kaipara, and 35 at Waipu Caves, Northland. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tame birds are often killed by dogs. Peahens are not attentive mothers, and many chicks are taken by predators. Feral population easily controlled by hunting. When disturbed, peafowl typically run downhill and then fly. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Breeding season late August to early January. Displays end 7-10 days before males moult their train of tail coverts. Females lay in bare scrapes concealed within long grass, and incubate eggs and raise young on their own. Clutch size is typically 4-6 eggs. Incubation takes 28-30 days and chicks can stay with their mother for more than a year. In wild populations, clutches appear to be deserted when 1-2 young are hatched. Females with young remain separate from flocks, until the young are 4 months old. Chicks forage for themselves with the peahen pointing at food with her bill. A single brood is raised per annum. Males take 6 years to be fully mature.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wild peafowl descend from roost trees within the first 2 hours of dawn, and ascend to their roosts about half an hour after sunset. They feed most actively in the early morning and during the last two hours of daylight. Males arrive quickly at display sites during the breeding season and seldom leave them until mid afternoon. Males display in expanded lek (i.e. several males display out of view but in vocal contact with each other) and are visited by groups of females. Outside the breeding season males flock together with females. Males tend to roost alone or in groups. Young males leave roost sites of females and young to roost with other males or alone at the end of their second year. Females and young less than 4 months old roost separately from other peafowl.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Peafowl are omnivorous, taking grains, seeds and fleshy fruits, flowers, and invertebrates, especially cicadas and crickets. They peck at objects and climb trees to access fruits and flowers. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Beauchamp, A.

When seen at close range in good light, males have copper, greenish-gold and blackish-blue sheens on their feathers. The long tail feathers are barred brown with a blackish-brown subterminal band and pale brown terminal band. The exposed head skin is bare, with prominent blue and red wattles that are more brightly coloured when engorged during display.

The earliest release recorded was on Kawau Island in the 1860s, and turkeys were feral in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay by 1894. Their feral range has expanded since the 1970s, and they are now found in rough farmland with scattered trees throughout much of lowland North Island, the Marlborough Sounds, and at scattered eastern locations in the South Island. Turkeys are also feral on some large farmed islands including Waiheke and&#xA0;Great Barrier Islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No population estimates.

Tree ducks fly with their head lower than their back and with conspicuously trailing legs, and their noisy wingbeats making a whistling sound.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Whistling ducks stand erect and goose-like but are much smaller and slimmer than geese or shelducks. The plumed whistling-duck is predominantly pale fawn or buff with pale chestnut sides. It has very prominent, long and pale yellow flank feathers extending up almost onto the back. The bill is pink with dark freckles, and the legs and feet pale pink. The sexes are alike and of similar size.</p>\n<p>Voice: plumed whistling-ducks give loud high-pitched whistles, and there is constant twittering within flocks.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the plumed whistling-duck is distinguished from the wandering whistling-duck by its generally pale colouration (the wandering whistling-duck has dark back, legs and crown) and its prominent pale yellow lanceolate flank feathers. Note that the wandering whistling-duck has yet to be recorded in New Zealand and so is not featured on New Zealand Birds Online.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>Plumed whistling-ducks occur across northern Australia, throughout Queensland and into New South Wales, in the upper Darling River basin and Murray &amp; Murrumbidgee catchments. Formerly considered of rare occurrence in New Zealand (approx. 8 times during the 20th century), small flocks have occurred at least&#xA0;7 times since 2000. Most sightings have been of small flocks (maximum 14 birds) at the western edge of New Zealand, but birds have reached Hawke&#x2019;s Bay (Anderson Park, Napier) and Chatham Island (2 different flocks of 3, both in 2011).

According to Acclimatisation Society records, there were four releases to the following regions; Canterbury (1866), Otago (1868-69), Auckland (1869, by Sir George Grey, and again in 1871). The mute swan is monotypic with no subspecies. Its closest relative is the Australasian black swan.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The mute swan is a large, entirely white swan. There is no sexual dimorphism in plumage, but females are smaller. In striking comparison to the white body plumage are the bright orange-red bill and wedge-like black mask and knob of the upper mandible. The mask extends back to a point in front of the eye. The bill knob is larger in the male. The mute swan is one of the largest flying birds and it limits its flying to migration and movement between suitable habitat. It spends most of its time floating on the water surface where it uses its long neck to feed on submerged water plants. Some young cygnets are born with white down, but the most common colours range from grey to buff.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The natural range for the mute swan is throughout northern Eurasia to eastern Europe. It also extends into temperate areas of Asia. It migrates through northern Europe and occasionally to North Africa and the Mediterranean. Introduced to the USA, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand, wild mute swans are found in Canterbury and Hawkes Bay, with a few other small semi-feral populations near where they have been released. Its preferred habitat is lakes and ponds of still and slow moving water. They feed on the vegetation of water margins and shallow lake beds. Mute swans build large raised nests in shallow water close to the margins of lakes and ponds. They have a strong pair bond and reuse nests. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The mute swan has a wide distribution in the northern hemisphere, with the largest breeding populations in the countries of the former Soviet Union (350,000 birds), Volga Delta (11,000 pairs), United Kingdom (22,000 birds) and Germany (8,000 pairs). Introduced mute swans bred rapidly in the USA and are now considered an invasive species. Although very small, wild populations have established in New Zealand at Lake Ellesmere (80 birds) and Hawkes Bay (20 birds). Some semi-feral populations exist in municipal gardens such as Virginia Lake, Whanganui.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Until 2010, mute swans had absolute protection under the Wildlife Act 1953. This total protection has now been lifted. It can now be culled or held in captivity at the discretion of the Minister of Conservation. However, there have been no incidences of populations becoming invasive or destructive as in the USA. The contrary situation exists with the mute swan populations in New Zealand declining owing to predation and outbreaks of botulism.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_Swan\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_Swan</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">del Hoyo, J., <em>et al., </em>(ed). 1992. <em>Handbook of the birds of the world</em>. 1.

They were deliberately reintroduced, initially from Melbourne, in the 1860s. Their distribution and abundance within a few years of those small reintroductions suggests that, coincidentally, natural re-colonisation may have occurred. Periodic immigration from Australia may still occur but has yet to be confirmed. </p>\n<p>Widespread and common in eastern and south-western Australia and Tasmania, the black swan also ranges into the continent&#x2019;s interior following heavy rain events.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>A large black swan, usually seen floating on water. When the wings are lifted, or when flying, pure white flight feathers are visible, which are black-tipped in immature birds. The bill is a bright red with a terminal white band, the eyes are red, and the legs are dark grey. Both sexes are alike, but the female is noticeably smaller than the male. Cygnets are grey with a black bill, and newly-fledged young are dull greyish-brown with a brown eye. On land swans walk slowly and are ungainly. In flight, the birds labour and their conspicuous white flight feathers elicit a whistling sound. </p>\n<p>Voice: generally described as &#x201C;a musical bugling&#x201D; given primarily as a contact call between mates and often accompanied by flicking &#xA0;head movements. Hisses when defending young or when threatening.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the only other swan in New Zealand is the larger and all white mute swan, which is very rare.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are widely scattered throughout New Zealand and on the Chatham Islands. Occurs on most lakes and larger constructed ponds, and also on estuaries, which are an important feeding and moulting habitat. Gathers in large flocks on selected estuaries (e.g., Awarua Bay, Farewell Spit, Tauranga Harbour, Kaipara Harbour) in January&#x2013;February to moult, at which time the birds are flightless.&#xA0; </p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are common, with a national population of about 50,000 (2011). Formerly much more numerous but the widespread loss of aquatic plants, their preferred foods, from most lowland lakes has greatly reduced their numbers and made those swans still present more reliant on lakeside land plants and grasses.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Previously identified as being structured into regional populations, with key breeding lakes and associated estuarine areas for feeding and moulting for each. However, as a consequence of the eutrophication of most lowland lakes, this structure may have broken down and swans may be more dispersive. </p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are a legal gamebird in most parts of New Zealand with up to 7,000 shot annually (2011). They are unprotected on Chatham Island, where eggs are also gathered periodically to effect population control. Some lakeside farmers are intolerant to swans grazing their pastures, especially in winter, and require Fish &amp; Game Councils to harass the swans or cull their numbers.&#xA0; </p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans breed only on freshwaters. However, even at major breeding sites, the majority of birds present seem not to participate. Most breeding occurs as monogamous territorial pairs defending all or part of a pond, small lake or lake edge. Formerly there were extensive nesting in colonies on large lakes with profuse lake-bed aquatic plant beds and with fluctuating water levels (e.g., Lakes Ellesmere, Whangape and Wairarapa) but this habit is now rare primarily because most lowland lakes are eutrophic and dominated by algal blooms. Nesting may commence in July with a large mound of vegetation being accumulated at a secluded site on the water&#x2019;s edge.&#xA0;On average 5-6 pale green eggs are laid and incubated for about 36 days mostly, but not exclusively, by the female. Young fledge after about 120 days, but families may remain together for several months. Occasionally, and where lake food is plentiful, a pair may nest again in late summer and raise a second brood.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Colonial nesting generally occurs later in the year (September&#x2013;November) and coincides with the post-winter decline in water levels. There is considerable mating promiscuity, and large clutches (7-14 eggs) result from females laying in unattended nests. Some creching of young occurs where lake food is abundant.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are graceful, slow swimmers which, even when in flocks, seem to be associated in pairs. The larger male raises its elaborately crinkled upper wing feathers (coverts and tertials) in sexual and threat displays. Both members of a pair perform elaborate greeting displays to each involving head flicks and trumpeting calls. A substantial proportion of the total population remains dispersed as flocks on fresh and estuarine waters throughout the year, and the ages of these birds and of social structures in the flocks remains unknown. </p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are entirely herbivorous,&#xA0;preferring submerged freshwater plants such as <em>Egeria, Elodea, Potamogeton </em>and<em> Myriophyllum, </em>and<em> Ruppia</em> in brackish waters. When lakes levels are high and submerged plants unreachable, or when submerged plants are sparse, swans will graze lakeside pastures onto which they can swim or walk. In estuaries, the main food is <em>Zostera. </em>However they require freshwater and they favour <em>Zostera</em> beds in close proximity to incoming streams or drains or estuarine channels carrying strong freshwater flows at low tide. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/wellington/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/waterfowl-ducks-and-swans/other-game-waterfowl/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/wellington/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/waterfowl-ducks-and-swans/other-game-waterfowl/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kear, J.

Six birds released in 1914-15 at Lakes Hawea and Wanaka resulted in a small breeding population that persisted until 1946. Birds recorded elsewhere during or soon after that &#x2013; Lake Thompson (1934), Loch Maree (March 1947) and Lake Hankinson (June 1947) &#x2013; may have come from this population.&#xA0;This species does not normally fly long distances in Australia, and it is unknown if any New Zealand birds are true vagrants from across the Tasman. Most recent records are almost certainly released or escaped captive birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Cape Barren goose is a large, grey goose with a comparatively small head and a short black bill largely obscured by a prominent lime-yellow cere that surrounds the large nares. The forehead and crown are whiter than the rest of the grey head and neck, this is more apparent in adult birds. Both the upper- and under-parts are grey with a slight brown wash. Paler margins to the breast and back feathers create a faint scaly effect. The tail and both sets of tail coverts are black. The upper wing coverts each have a dark grey spot near their tips, showing up as three lines of small spots on the closed wing. Spots on the scapulars are larger and browner; these are smaller in immature birds. The flight feathers are grey with black tips, the extent of which increases towards the outer primaries where it covers the distal half of the feathers. The iris is honey coloured, and the legs are deep pink with black feet, giving the impression that the bird has been walking in mud. Goslings are strongly patterned black and white, including having a black mask.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a rasping two-note call that rises and falls rhythmically, often given by birds when flying. Also has a deep, double-note, pig-like grunt, hence its colloquial name &#x2018;pig goose&#x2019;.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since 1988, a small population of liberated birds has become established at St Anne&#x2019;s Lagoon / Mata Kopae in North Canterbury, where up to 18 birds have been recorded together. Individual and pairs of birds are also intermittently recorded around Christchurch (Lake Ellesmere, Travis wetland, Waipara and Amberley lagoons, wetlands and pastures along the Cam River), south to Timaru; these birds are probably escapees from Peacock Springs wildlife park, which has a captive population. Some of these feral birds have been recorded breeding. A small population in the South Kaipara Harbour region, north of Helensville, probably also originates from liberated birds, as has a pair near Hokitika. Incidental records (Takaka, 1998; Wanganui and Waikanae, 1987-1988; Waikanae-Paraparaumu, 2001-2002; Owaka, 2004; Kaikoura, 2005, 2009; near Kaitaia, 2006; Cape Reinga, 2009; Mowhanau Beach, 2010, 2012; Catlins River, 2011; and Lake Hood, near Ashburton, 2011) are also most likely to be escapees from private waterfowl collections.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cape Barren geese are almost wholly terrestrial, inhabiting open grassland, including planted pastures, on the fringes of wetlands; they avoid scrub-encroached grasslands. Some birds also visit the coast, including a pair seen flying from Stephenson Island (Mahinepua) in early 2011, and 7 birds seen on a headland there in late 2012. This raises the possibility of a small breeding population becoming established in a similar environment to that in which they breed in Australia: small offshore islets in the Bass Strait, and the Recherche Archipelago, Western Australia.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The size of the New Zealand Cape Barren goose population is not known but probably small. Maximum numbers reported from a site are 18 (St Anne&#x2019;s Lagoon / Mata Kopae), but three-quarters of all sightings are of individuals or pairs. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geese generally can be destructive in newly sown croplands, and their droppings can foul pastures, but the extent of impact depends on the number of birds. Given this species&#x2019; small population, patchy distribution and apparently limited capacity to establish and spread, it is unlikely to be causing any significant economic or ecological impacts.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Monogamous; pairs generally mate for life. Only a few breeding records are known from New Zealand, all of pairs with young goslings. Nesting takes place in late winter, with goslings being seen in early spring. In Australia, the nests are placed beneath bushes or in large grass tussocks, always in positions where the birds have a good view. Nests are built-up grass-lined hollows filled with grey down that covers the eggs when the female leaves the nest. Only the female incubates, but both parents brood small goslings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mainly terrestrial, in Australia grazing on short grassland, pastures, and coastal fringes. Calls and threat displays similar to those of other geese. In this, birds lift their folded wings repeatedly, stretching out and pumping their necks vigorously, the intensity rising with increasing levels of aggression. On attack, a bird either rushes forward with the head held out and low, or runs upright with wings spread. After mating, a pair performs a &#x2018;triumph ceremony&#x2019;, facing each other while raising and lowering their heads on outstretched necks, calling loudly. The same display is given after aggressive encounters with other birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cape Barren geese graze green grass, legumes and other herbs. They also strip seed heads, and in captivity will feed on grain scattered on the ground. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Barren_Goose\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Barren_Goose</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Over the years geese have been bred and kept not just for the meat, fat, eggs and down they provide, but for controlling weeds, fighting and guard duty as well. The first birds of any kind introduced into New Zealand were five geese brought from South Africa by Captain Cook and set free at Goose Cove in Dusky Sound. This was not successful and there were just a few attempts by acclimatisation societies to establish them too. The birds seen in the wild throughout New Zealand have probably originated from stray farmyard geese that are often managed by benign neglect. It is difficult to tell which geese on farms and parks are truly wild, and which are more or less domestic, but some flocks are clearly independent of people.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feral geese are descended from wild greylag geese of Eurasia. They are large geese; males are entirely white and females have large greyish brown patches, especially on the lower breast and sides and on the neck. On the sides of the upper part of the neck the feathers are arranged into a series of fine grooves. The bill is deep at the base and, along with the feet, usually orange but may be pinkish. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The feet are placed well forward and they walk easily. They are heavier at the hind end than Canada geese and have a more upright stance. On the water the rear end sits much higher and the tail is more angled, about 45&#xB0; from the water. Young goslings are downy and yellow, browner above and paler below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a loud and resonant slightly buzzing &#x201C;honk&#x201D;. Males may also hiss in defence and aggression.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: male feral geese are much smaller than adult mute swans, and have a shorter, thicker neck and more compact body. Pale brown juvenile mute swans are equally large, similar in shape and uniformly coloured. Feral geese are more heavily built than Canada geese, and females do not have the black head and neck nor white cheek patch that is characteristic of Canada geese. The dove-grey Cape Barren goose is smaller, and has a largely yellowish-green bill and black flight feathers. A white male goose in flight may also resemble a royal spoonbill at a distance as both fly with their necks outstretched, but geese lack the obvious large black bill of spoonbills.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feral greylag geese are widespread in both main islands but are largely absent from Fiordland and Westland south of Greymouth. They are also common on the Chatham Islands. Feral geese are usually seen in urban parks and on pasture grass or adjacent ponds in farmland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No attempt has been made to assess the population of feral geese in New Zealand and it would be difficult to differentiate truly feral geese from free-ranging domesticated birds. The population is likely to be in the low thousands. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geese defecate copiously and may foul pasture making it unfit as food for farm animals. However, flocks are usually controlled to a level where this is not important. In urban parks aggressive male geese may threaten, chase and even bite people.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is no published information on the breeding of feral greylag geese in New Zealand. They nest on the ground, often near water, under cover such as long grass and willows.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geese are sociable, resting and feeding in flocks. Although favoured as food in some countries they are not esteemed in New Zealand, and so the birds are not often hunted and therefore moderately tame.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feral greylag geese graze on foliage and seeds of pasture grasses and herbs often well away from water.

They evolved into a wide variety of sizes to become the largest terrestrial herbivores in prehistoric New Zealand. Together they represent the most diverse radiation of any New Zealand endemic bird group. DNA study shows the moa radiation occurred principally in the South Island, coinciding with the accelerated uplifting of the Southern Alps and the resulting increase in habitat diversity across New Zealand circa 5 - 8.5 million years ago. All the moa species became extinct abruptly, 500-600 years ago, as a result of human overhunting. DNA study suggests that moa&#xA0;were more closely related to the flighted South American tinamou than to the kiwi.</p>\n<p>The upland moa was a relatively small, agile moa species that was once common in the South Island subalpine zone, especially north-west Nelson, Otago and Fiordland. It was rarer in eastern and lowland areas. The only species in the Family <em>Megalapterygidae</em>, it was distinct from other moa species in its smaller, less bulky build and feathered lower legs. Its long, slender toes may have been adapted for walking across snow. Its bill was more pointed than in most moa species and its mummified remains show it had two types of feathers: some with a greyish-white base, becoming blacker and ending in a white tip, giving a mottled effect, and others with a plain or slightly streaky appearance. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A relatively small, slender moa with mottled plumage covering the whole body, extending to the base of the bill and covering the lower legs. The head was relatively small, with a delicate, pointed, slightly decurved bill, and relatively large nostril and ear openings. Upland moa had three, long muscular, forward-turned toes, each with thick, pointed claws, and one reduced backward-turned toe.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: closest in size to Mantell&apos;s moa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Island only. Formerly widespread and common in the subalpine zone up to 2,000 m above sea level in high country herbfields, tussocklands and montane forest, from north-west Nelson and the Kaikoura Ranges, south to Fiordland and Otago.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main cause of extinction was overhunting by humans for food. The remains of moa are widespread in middens, along with specialised tools used to cut up moa carcasses and to work bones into tools. Moa chicks may have been killed by the introduced Polynesian dog (kuri). Before human arrival, upland moa were preyed on by Haast&apos;s eagle.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DNA evidence and egg shell and bone remains found at rock shelter sites in north and central Otago suggest upland moa once nested in rock shelters throughout this region. Plant remains found at nest sites strongly suggests that they built the nests in late spring-early summer. The plant remains found show they clipped twigs 20-60 mm long and up to 4.7 mm wide from a range of locally available trees and shrubs, using their bill. These twigs were then used to build a nest that was a shallow bed of clipped twigs, coarse vegetation and stripped bark. Nesting in rock shelters suggests that they bred as solitary pairs, rather than in colonies. One or two dark olive to pale green eggs were laid per breeding season. The relatively large eggs (likely to have been about 162 x 111 mm) in comparison with body size suggest a long incubation period, probably more than two months. The male is thought to have incubated the eggs, as they do in most other ratites. Chicks were probably able to forage for their own food soon after hatching.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This relatively small moa species was more agile than other moa. It lived mainly in the subalpine zone, including rocky subalpine sites such as the tops of Mt Owen and Mt Arthur in north-west Nelson. It ate a wide variety of alpine herbs and browsed southern beech and small shrubs in montane forests. The best preserved mummified remains of moa are of this species, and were found in relatively dry, enclosed rocky subalpine sites. Some of these remains show signs of &quot;shock moult&quot;, the first evidence of feather moult in any moa species. It is possible that moa plumage colouration and marking were driven by selection pressure to avoid predation by Haast&apos;s eagle.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The diet included leaves and small woody branchlets of many species, including southern beech, nectar-rich flowers of species such as flax and tree fuchsia, and subalpine herbs and small shrubs in open herbfield and grassland habitats.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_Moa\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_Moa</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Listen</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/audio/2552869/coprolites-and-extinct-moa\">http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/audio/2552869/coprolites-and-extinct-moa</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, A. 1989. <em>Prodigious birds: moas and moa-hunting in prehistoric New Zealand</em>.

Slender with relatively long legs, it inhabited dense forest and shrubland. It was the only species in the genus <em>Anomalopteryx. </em>Its relatively short, sharp-edged bill appears to have been more suited to cutting than those of other moa species. This attribute and the large number of stones typically found in the bird&apos;s gizzard, suggest that it had a woody, fibrous diet. It appears to have lived singly or in small groups at a suggested density of one pair per square kilometre. It was probably preyed on by both Haast&apos;s eagle and Eyles&apos; harrier in the South Island, and the larger Eyles&apos; harriers of the North Island.

As its Latin name suggests, the heavy-footed moa was a mammoth moa species, complete with shaggy hair-like feathers, a long trunk-like neck, and elephantine feet. It was the heaviest moa species relative to height, and laid the second largest moa eggs yet found. Like a woolly elephant, its large bulky body would have helped it bulldoze through vegetation, and its large size and shaggy feathers would have helped it cope with cold temperatures. A large olfactory chamber suggests it had an acute sense of smell, which may have been an adaptation for a partly nocturnal life. Study of feathers from mummified remains suggests that heavy-footed moa had speckled patterning similar to the upland moa, or they were plain or slightly streaked. They were preyed on by Haast&apos;s eagle, and their bones are known from widespread midden sites. All nine moa species became extinct abruptly, 500-600 years ago, as a result of human overhunting.

It had a rounded head, and a long, sturdy, decurved bill with a pointed tip. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: where their ranges overlapped, the stout-legged moa was about two-thirds the size of the heavy-footed moa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The heavy-footed moa was mainly found in the eastern lowlands of the South Island, from Canterbury to Southland. Here it shared the lowland forests, shrublands and wetland edges with three other large moa: South Island giant moa, stout-legged moa and eastern moa. It was one of two moa species recorded from Rakiura/Stewart Island, along with the South Island giant moa,</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The heavy-footed moa was common.

Moa chicks may also have been eaten by the introduced Polynesian dog (kuri). Burning of eastern dryland forests and shrublands is likely to have reduced the extent of suitable habitat.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heavy-footed moa laid massive eggs.&#xA0;Three attributed to this species measured about 226 x 158 mm. Little has been deduced about their breeding ecology. Like other moa, the heavy-footed moa is assumed to have bred as isolated pairs, laid a small clutch, and had male-only incubation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The extremely large olfactory lobes of the heavy-footed moa suggest that it had an acute sense of smell, the function of which is unknown. The three members of the <em>Pachyornis</em> genus had largely non-overlapping distributions, with the small Mantell&#x2019;s moa confined to the North Island, and the crested moa mainly occurring at higher altitudes than the heavy-footed moa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heavy-footed moa consumed branchlets of trees and shrubs, herbaceous plants and flax, the fibrous leaves of the latter having been found among gizzard stones.

It was one of two moa species that were confined to the North Island and Aotea/Great Barrier Island, the other being the North Island giant moa. Adult females were markedly larger than adult males; the average size increased further south and during glacial periods. Its remains are abundant in archaeological sites, indicating that it was hunted for food. It was probably preyed on by the large North Island Eyles&apos; harrier. The species was named after&#xA0;Walter Mantell, a pioneering New Zealand naturalist, government administrator and politician of the 1800s.

They evolved into a wide variety of sizes to become the largest terrestrial herbivores in prehistoric New Zealand. Together they represent the most diverse radiation of any New Zealand endemic bird group. Moa were unique among birds in lacking any wing bones. Like other flightless ratites, such as the New Zealand kiwi, Australian emu and Australo-Papuan cassowaries, they had no tail and lacked a keel on the sternum (the attachment point for wing muscles in other birds). All the moa species became extinct abruptly, 500-600 years ago, as a result of human overhunting. DNA study suggests that moa&#xA0;were more closely related to the flighted South American tinamou than to the kiwi.</p>\n<p>The eastern moa was common in the eastern South Island. It was sufficiently distinct from other moa to be placed in its own genus. This species and the larger stout-legged moa were remarkable in having a very long elongated windpipe, which probably enabled them to make louder, more resonant calls than those of other moa. The windpipe included a loop up to one metre long that ran downwards inside the left side of the body, and across to the other side before it doubled back on itself to the breast and into the lungs. Modern day swan, crane and some spoonbill species also have elongated windpipes, and this explains their resonant, bugling calls. Only male eastern moa appear to have had an elongated windpipe, and so their calls may have had a role in sexual selection and competition for mates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The eastern moa was a relatively short-legged, bulky, medium-sized moa. It had a relatively small head, and a delicate, pointed, slightly decurved bill. It had thick legs and very wide feet. The shaggy body feathers extended on to the upper leg, but were sparse on the neck, which had scaled skin with raised papillae. Adult females were 15-20% larger than adult males. Size increased towards the south of their range, and also&#xA0;during colder glacial periods.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: unknown, but probably relatively loud and far-carrying.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the larger, bulkier stout-legged moa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The eastern moa lived in lowland forest and wetland habitats up to 200 m above sea level in the South Island. It was common in dunelands, grasslands, shrublands and mixed forest in the east from the Wairau River south to Southland and Central Otago, and inland to the foothills of the Southern Alps.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main cause of extinction was overhunting by humans for food. The remains of moa are widespread in middens, along with specialised tools used to cut up carcasses and to work bones into tools. Middens dating from the thirteenth century, surveyed at the Wairau River bar in the Marlborough district, contained remains of more than 4,000 individual moa and large numbers of moa eggs. Eastern moa was the second most abundant species recorded at the site after stout-legged moa. Moa chicks may have been eaten by the introduced Polynesian dog (kuri). Burning of the eastern moa&apos;s forest and shrubland habitat is also likely to have reduced its numbers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DNA evidence and egg shell and bone remains found at rock shelter sites in north and central Otago suggest that eastern moa once nested in rock shelters in this region. Plant remains found at nest sites strongly suggests that they built the nests in late spring-early summer. The plant remains found show that eastern moa clipped twigs 20-60 mm long and up to 4.7 mm wide from a range of locally available trees and shrubs. These twigs were used to build a nest consisting of a shallow bed of clipped twigs, coarse vegetation and stripped bark. The constrained space of rock shelters containing nest remains suggests that they bred as isolated pairs, rather than in colonies. Probably one or two eggs were laid per breeding season. The relatively large eggs (likely to have been about 180 x 132 mm) in comparison with body size suggest a long incubation, probably exceeding two months. The male is thought to have incubated the eggs, as is the case with most other ratites. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Its short, thick legs and very wide feet suggest that the eastern moa moved relatively slowly. The eastern moa and the larger stout-legged moa were remarkable in having a very long elongated windpipe, which probably enabled them to make louder calls that carried further than those of other moa species. Eastern moa appear to have been browsers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Soft leaves and fruits rather than the fibrous material eaten by other moa species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Moa\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Moa</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, A. 1989. <em>Prodigious birds: moas and moa-hunting in prehistoric New Zealand</em>.

Burning of the stout-legged moa&apos;s forest and shrubland habitats is also likely to have reduced its numbers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DNA evidence and egg shell and bone remains found at rock shelter sites in north and central Otago suggest that stout-legged moa once nested in rock shelters in this region. Plant remains found at nest sites strongly suggests they built nests in late spring-early summer. The plant remains found show they clipped twigs 20-60 mm long and up to 4.7 mm wide from a wide range of locally available trees and shrubs using their bill. The nest consisted of a shallow bed of clipped twigs, coarse vegetation and stripped bark. Nesting in rock shelters suggests that they bred as isolated pairs, rather than colonies. One or two eggs were probably laid per breeding season. The relatively large eggs in comparison with body size suggest a long incubation, probably longer than two months. Two moa eggs from Doubtless Bay (average dimensions 121 x 94 mm) are likely to be from the small northern population of this species. Eggs from the South island attributed to stout-legged moa averaged 204 x 143 mm.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Stout-legged moa lived in the vegetation mosaic of grassland-shrubland-forest found in the drier regions of the North and South Islands, especially in Canterbury and Otago, and coastal areas in the North Island. They browsed shrubs and herbs. DNA study shows that stout-legged moa in central Otago had a diverse diet of herbs and shrubs, reflecting local vegetation patterns and ground-level grazing of herbaceous plants. Stout-legged moa took up to nine years to reach adult size.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A diverse diet of leaves and fruits of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants, rather than the more fibrous, woody material eaten by the larger moa species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-billed_Moa\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-billed_Moa</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, A. 1989. <em>Prodigious birds: moas and moa-hunting in prehistoric New Zealand</em>.

Adult females stood up to 2 metres high at the back, and could reach foliage up to 3.6 metres off the ground, making them the tallest bird species known. It was one of two species of giant moa, the other being the smaller North Island species, which are placed in a separate family from the two families containing the seven smaller moa species. All nine moa were unique among birds in having no trace of wing bones. DNA study suggests all moa species were more closely related to the flighted South American tinamou than to the New Zealand kiwi. They were the dominant New Zealand land vertebrates, exhibiting far greater adaptive radiation than other New Zealand landbirds. Regrettably, all were extinct within a few centuries of human arrival.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moa radiation occurred principally in the South Island, where seven species occurred (five endemic), though it was unusual to have more than four species present at any one site. In contrast, the North Island had only four moa species, including two endemic species. Radiation of moa was coincident with the accelerated uplifting of the Southern Alps and the resulting increase in habitat diversity across New Zealand c.5 - 8.5 million years ago, which may explain the greater moa diversity in the South Island.</p>\n<p>South Island giant moa ranged widely across all vegetated habitats from coastal dunes to inland shrublands, forests, and subalpine herbfields and grasslands in the South Island and on D&apos;Urville Island. Both the giant moa species (genus <em>Dinornis</em>) had longer, stronger necks than the other moa species, with three extra vertebrae. They exhibited the greatest size difference between the sexes of any bird species, with adult females much larger than males. Birds that inhabited lowland shrubland were larger than those from upland forests.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The South Island giant moa was a very tall, relatively slender moa with a relatively small, broad, flattened head, and robust, flattened, slightly decurved bill. Females were markedly larger than males, being c.150%&#xA0;the height&#xA0;and c.280% the weight. The few feathers attributed to this species indicate that it had a plain or slightly streaky appearance.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the South Island giant moa was much taller and relatively more slender than the other large South Island moa species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Island giant moa were found&#xA0; in the South Island,&#xA0;Stewart Island&#xA0;and D&apos;Urville Island, in&#xA0;wide range of vegetated habitats including&#xA0;coastal dunes,&#xA0;inland shrublands, forests, and subalpine herbfields and grasslands. Bones recovered from caves, dunes, swamps and middens show that it was widespread in the eastern South Island from coastal Marlborough south to Southland, and inland to the subalpine zone.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Island giant moa were widespread and abundant.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before human arrival, the South Island&#x2019;s main predator was the giant Haast&#x2019;s eagle, also now extinct. Giant moa were rapidly hunted to extinction by early Maori. Their bones are widespread in middens, and were also shaped into tools and ornaments. Estimates of the number of individual moa remains in 1,200 open ovens and middens surveyed in the vicinity of the Waitaki River mouth during the 1930s range from 29,000 to 90,000. Moa chicks may also have been eaten by the introduced Polynesian dog (kuri). Burning of the giant moa&apos;s dry forest and shrubland habitat is also likely to have reduced their numbers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DNA evidence and egg shell and bone remains found at rock shelter sites in north and central Otago suggest South Island giant moa nested in rock shelters in this region. Plant remains found at nest sites strongly suggests they built nests in late spring-early summer. The plant remains found show they clipped twigs 20-60 mm long and up to 4.7 mm wide from a range of locally available trees and shrubs. These twigs were used to build a nest consisting of a shallow bed of clipped twigs, coarse vegetation and stripped bark. Nesting in rock shelters suggests they bred as isolated pairs, rather than in colonies. A large white giant moa egg (240 x 178 mm) thought to be of this species was found associated with a Maori burial site in Kaikoura. It is estimated the egg would have weighed 4 kg fresh and is the largest moa egg found so far. One or two eggs were probably laid per breeding season. The extremely large eggs suggest an incubation period longer than two months. The male is thought to have incubated the eggs, as is the case in most other ratites. Chicks were probably able to forage for their own food soon after hatching.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Island giant moa may have been the tallest birds known, but the largest of the extinct elephantbird species of Madagascar was heavier, possibly up to 340 kg. Giant moa were the largest herbivore in prehistoric South Island terrestrial ecosystems. Finds of relatively large gizzard stones and their large robust bill suggest that giant moa were able to process a highly fibrous diet. The relatively large olfactory chamber suggests an acute sense of smell. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The diet of the South Island giant moa included twigs, leaves, flowers, berries and seeds from the smaller branches of trees and shrubs, and herbs and vines. DNA study shows that South Island giant moa in central Otago consumed a wide diversity of herbs and shrubs, reflecting local vegetation patterns and ground-level grazing of herbaceous plants.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Giant_Moa\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Giant_Moa</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, A. 1989. <em>Prodigious birds: moas and moa-hunting in prehistoric New Zealand</em>.

The calls of weka are also similar, but have two-syllables and usually have fewer repetitions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Widespread and locally common in native and exotic forests, scrub and rough farmland in Northland and some of its offshore islands, several islands in the Hauraki Gulf, including Little Barrier, Kawau and Motuora, Coromandel Peninsula, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, northern and western Hawkes Bay, Tongariro, Taranaki, and Whanganui. Newly established populations at Tawharanui (North Auckland), Maungatautari (Waikato), Cape Kidnappers (Hawke&#x2019;s Bay), Pukaha/ Mt Bruce (Wairarapa) and Rimutaka Range (Wellington). At the time of European settlement they had a wider distribution, especially in North Auckland and the Waikato. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 25,000 birds in 2008; 1000 on the Coromandel Peninsula, and the rest evenly split between the Northland, Eastern and Western taxa. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">North Island brown kiwi have disappeared from many lowland sites and around the fringes of their distribution, through a combination of habitat loss and predation by mammalian predators, especially dogs, ferrets and stoats. Hourly call rates across the whole range is slowly declining, but landscape scale management of predators through periodic aerial 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) operations, or trapping, has slowed or reversed the declines in many areas. The removal of eggs or young chicks from the wild and the rearing of chicks and juveniles in captivity or in predator-proof cr&#xE8;ches, until large enough (1.2 kg) to cope with the presence of stoats, has allowed these populations to increase, or allowed releases into areas where the population had dwindled or become locally extinct. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eggs can be laid in any month, but the peak of laying is from June to November. The nest is in a short burrow, rock crevice, hollow base of a tree, or in a hollow log. Clutch size is 1-2. The white egg is very large. Incubation is by the male only. Eggs are left unattended during the night, but the time that the male is off the nest declines as incubation progresses. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown kiwi are flightless and nocturnal. During the day they rest in a burrow, hollow tree or log, or under thick vegetation and emerge shortly after nightfall. Feed by walking slowly along tapping the ground and when prey is detected they probe their bill into the leaf litter or a rotten log; occasionally plunge their bill deep into the ground. Call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners; pairs often duet, with the partner responding a few seconds after the first call has been completed.&#xA0; They are territorial, and fight conspecifics with their sharp claws.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown kiwi eat mostly small invertebrates, especially earthworms and larvae of beetles, cicadas and moths; they also eat centipedes, spiders, crickets and weta, Some small fallen fruit and leaves are eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org/\">http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colbourne, R.M. 2002.

The breast and abdomen are barred white and light brown, and the abdomen and under-tail is white. Back and upper wing surface a darker brown. Bill, legs and feet black, eye dark brown-black. Sexes alike but females are noticeably smaller than males. Goslings have yellowish-grey down and the juveniles appear as dull versions of the adult. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a distinctive and loud honk given when the birds are disturbed or surprised, or when flying. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: none. Other geese in New Zealand include the rare and vagrant Cape Barren goose and feral flocks of the domesticated greylag goose<em>.</em> </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Canada geese are widespread in the South Island and most numerous in pastoral areas of the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps from Marlborough to Central Otago, and around coastal lakes and lagoons. Their distribution is expanding in Fiordland and Southland. In the North Island, their distribution still reflects locations at which birds were released during the past 30 years, with the largest concentrations in Wairarapa, Hawkes Bay, Ruapehu-Taupo area, and Waikato. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pastoral land adjacent to a lake or large pond provides preferred habitat, but geese may also be found in well-forested mountain valleys, especially in Fiordland, and around alpine tarns. Communal moult gatherings at secluded or very large lakes with grazing available at the immediate margins. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Numbers are controlled by annual culls to reduce damage to lakeside pastures in some areas. Total population of about 60,000, two-thirds of which are in the South Island, and have been maintained at this number for most of the past decade. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Grazing of high-country lakeside pasture, especially autumn-saved pasture, is considered an economic burden for sheep farmers. Widespread irrigation to promote dairy farming in formerly dry country has allowed geese to remain year round and graze highly nutritious grasses. This prompted farmer advocacy to declare the bird a pest, and in 2011 the Canada goose was declared an unprotected species. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nests as solitary pairs but often in close proximity to other members of the flock. Monogamous, with female completing all of the incubation over about 27 days, and the gander actively defending a small territory around the nest. The nest is a down-lined ground depression often hidden amongst rushes or short protective vegetation. Clutch size generally 5 white eggs. Laying is mainly in September&#x2013;October but can also extend considerably later in the North Island, and second nestings have occasionally been recorded in December&#x2013;February. Both parents actively guard the young during their 8-9 weeks of growth until capable of flight. The family may remain together for several months and join with other pairs and families into an extended flock. When pairs nest in close proximity, amalgamation of broods and shared parental duties are common. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A wary, flocking bird generally seen on grassland in open spaces or on a lake&#x2019;s edge. Many flocks are extended multi-generation family groups and remain close to their breeding locations. Others, however, may undertake extensive moult migrations to larger waters where they undergo their annual wing moult. The bulk of these migrating birds are non-breeders or failed breeders; successful breeders usually moult their wing feathers on the breeding sites while still guarding their young. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Entirely herbivorous, preferring the sugar-laden bases of short grasses. Also very partial to clovers and other legumes and, occasionally, newly-germinated cereals. On the water they will nibble at seed heads of marginal sedges and feed on submerged plants such as <em>Elodea</em> and <em>Egeria.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Goose\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Goose</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Imber, M.J. 1971.

Birders would agree that the pink-eared duck is badly named, given the difficulty of seeing the pink ear in the field. When seen well however, it is a spectacular bird, not only for the pink feathers, but for its massive, oddly-shaped bill, and the striking zebra-striped sides. Highly nomadic, the pink-eared duck disperses widely in its native Australia, following good conditions for its breeding activities. It will breed in any month of the year when conditions are appropriate.</p>\n<p>The pink-eared duck is a small duck with a dark eye-patch and heavily barred sides. In good lighting conditions, a small patch of pink feathers can be seen behind the eye. Like the blue duck of New Zealand, the pink-eared duck possesses a laterally protruding membrane of skin at the tip of the bill. (Although spelled differently, the genus name of the pink-eared duck<em> Malacorhynchus</em>, is shared with the species name of the blue duck<em> malacorhynchos</em>; both mean &#x2018;soft-beak&#x2019;). At a distance, the boldly barred flanks, lower neck and breast, combined with the dark eye-patch, wide-tipped bill, and whitish face are the best identification features. In flight, the tail tip and trailing edge of the wings are white, as is a narrow band on the rump. The head is held high whilst flying. The sexes are the same, with the female slightly smaller. Immature birds are paler than adults, with the pink ear patch less vivid.</p>\n<p>Voice: sounds described include a trilling, chirruping or twittering, often given in flight; a high-pitched, sharp <em>ee-jik</em> or <em>tu-ick</em>; a low nasal <em>grunk</em>; and the bill-tossing call <em>whee-ooo</em>, <em>weeee-you</em> or <em>who-ee-oo</em>. Similar species: the Australasian shoveler shares the massive bill of the pink-eared duck, but is considerably larger, has a flat forehead leading in a straight line to the bill (the pink-eared has a prominent forehead), and the shoveler sits much lower in the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Endemic to Australia, the pink-eared duck is widespread, except for in the driest parts of Western and South Australia. Its greatest population density is in south-eastern Australia (although not in great numbers along the eastern seaboard), and the south-west corner of Western Australia. It is a rare visitor to Tasmania.</p>\n<p>The pink-eared duck favours inland wetlands, and avoids coastal wetlands with high rainfall. It tends to stay away from the shore when feeding. It prefers stagnant, shallow water rich in aquatic life, including sewage ponds, and avoids fast-moving, clear or deep water.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>A single bird was at the Mangere sewage ponds, Auckland, June-July 1990.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Even whilst in large flocks, the pink-eared duck remains in pairs. These will feed in a head-to-tail vortexing motion, each benefiting from the other disturbing aquatic organisms as they rotate. When feeding, their bills are frequently submerged to the line of the eyes, and they do not &#x2018;up-end&#x2019;. They often perch out of the water, e.g. on logs and branches. They fly with rapid wing-beats, and when flushed will circle wetlands.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The bill of the pink-eared duck is lined with fine lamellae for filter-feeding. The diet is mostly invertebrates (crustaceans and insects), and plant-matter including seeds.

Almost nothing is known about the species because it became extinct before European contact and its bones are rare. We can only speculate that it shared many habits with its presumed closest relative, the blue-billed duck (<em>Oxyura australis</em>) of Australia. It was probably an uncommon resident on lakes and swamps throughout New Zealand. Although the presence of <em>Oxyura</em> fossils in New Zealand was suggested as early as 1983, based on bones excavated in the 1960s and 70s, it was not until 2005 that this genus was confirmed for New Zealand (Worthy 2005). The specific name honours Gerry van Tets (1929-1995) who first identified the New Zealand fossils as being from the genus <em>Oxyura</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>A small compact duck, bearing a superficial resemblance to the New Zealand scaup but likely to have had the distinctive sexual plumage dimorphism shown by its Australian cousin. In breeding plumage, males of the Australian species are a rich chestnut colour with a black head and a cobalt-blue bill, while non-breeders, females and juveniles are a duller brown. All other members of the genus <em>Oxyura</em> have a distinctive stiff tail, so it can be theorised that the New Zealand form shared this feature and some of the distinctive behavioural traits of the genus. The New Zealand species was slightly smaller than the Australian species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils of the New Zealand blue-billed duck have been found at two sites only (representing 20+ individuals) and all but one bone is from Holocene deposits at&#xA0;Lake Poukawa in Hawke&apos;s Bay. A single South Island bone may be from the Wairau Bar, near Blenheim. The species probably shared the habits of the closely related Australian species which is almost wholly aquatic, often on large permanent wetlands. During the breeding season the Australian species is thinly distributed in densely vegetated swamps and secretive but it can form large flocks in open water in the non-breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Extreme rarity of the species in the New Zealand fossil record probably partly reflects the lack of fossil deposits from lakes rather than a true scarceness in life.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand blue-billed duck became extinct before European contact, and so no records of live birds exist. Hunting for food by humans is the most likely cause of its demise and the South Island bone may have been from a human food midden.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is known about the New Zealand species&apos; behaviour but the Australian blue-billed duck is polygamous, nests are mainly solitary and often contain 5-6 (white) eggs. Incubation and parental care is by the female only. The Australian species is renowned for its extraordinarily long pseudopenis, which is grossly large in proportion to the size of the bird.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The related Australian blue-billed duck has several elaborate displays, including holding its stiff tail semi-erect for courtship and alarm displays. Unlike many New Zealand bird species, there is no evidence that the New Zealand blue-billed duck had a reduced ability to fly compared with its relatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is known about the food of the New Zealand species but the Australian blue-billed duck eats a wide variety of freshwater plants and invertebrates and frequently dives for food .</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Stiff-tailed_Duck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Stiff-tailed_Duck</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

It and the extinct New Zealand blue-billed duck are the only members of the subfamily Oxyurinae (stiff-tailed ducks) ever reported from New Zealand. The rarity of New Zealand musk duck bones and its prehistoric extinction mean that almost nothing is known about it. We can only speculate that it shared many habits with its closest relative - the only other musk duck in the world - <em>Biziura lobata</em> of Australia.

The New Zealand species was about ten percent larger than its Australian cousin and, apart from being larger overall, had relatively large legs but relatively short wings. While it may have been evolving towards a more sedentary lifestyle, its skeletal proportions suggest that it could still fly. Presuming that it shared features with the Australian species, it would have had a distinctive appearance. The Australian species is a short-necked, thickset bird with a broad beak and a stiff tail. Musk ducks are unusual for having a large size difference between the sexes, the males emit a pungent musky smell in the breeding season, and they have a huge lobe that hangs below their bill. The Australian species is a mottled grey-brown colour, so the New Zealand species was probably fairly drab in colour also.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils of the New Zealand musk duck have been found at&#xA0;five sites only (representing&#xA0;at least nine&#xA0;individuals) spread throughout New Zealand. The species probably shared the habits of the closely related Australian species which is almost wholly aquatic, preferring deep, permanent wetlands, estuaries and sheltered coastal waters. During the breeding season the Australian species is thinly distributed in densely vegetated swamps but it sometimes forms flocks on open water bodies in the non-breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Rarity in the fossil record suggests that the New Zealand musk duck was largely confined to deep stable water bodies that are represented by few fossil sites in New Zealand.&#xA0; It may never have been common.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand musk duck became extinct in prehistoric times, and so no records of live birds exist. One bone was found in a human food midden, and hunting for food by people is the most likely cause of its demise.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is known about the New Zealand musk duck&apos;s behaviour. The Australian musk duck makes a flimsy nest in dense vegetation. As for most ducks, incubation and parental care is by the female only, who also&#xA0;feeds the young. No other duck species is known to feed its young.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian musk duck has elaborate displays, including bringing its spread tail forward to rest on its back while prominently displaying its throat lobe during courtship, and males are aggressively territorial. The New Zealand species may have shared these traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is known about the food of the New Zealand species, but the Australian musk duck dives for small freshwater animals.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Musk_Duck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Musk_Duck</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Lalas, C.; Hamel, J.; Tennson, A.J.D.; Worthy, T.H. 2014.

It has undergone a remarkable increase in population and distribution since about 1990, including the colonisation of sports fields and other open grassed areas within urban environments. This expansion has occurred in the face of being a gamebird and hunted annually.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The paradise shelduck is a conspicuous and colourful species with contrasting male and female plumages. Between a large duck and a small goose in size, the male is uniformly dark grey or black while the female body is a dark or light chestnut (depending on age and state of moult). The male&#x2019;s head is black with occasional green iridescence and the female&#x2019;s head and upper neck is white. Both sexes have a chestnut undertail, black primary wing feathers, green secondary wing feathers and a conspicuously white upper wing surface. Variable amounts of white may occur on the heads of males during the eclipse moult (February-May) and newly-fledged juvenile females may retain an extensive black head with a white face patch until they complete their post-juvenal moult (by May). The bill, legs and feet are dark grey/black. Down-covered ducklings appear initially as &#x201C;mint humbugs&#x201D;, patterned brown-and-white. The first feathers are dark, and near-fledged ducklings of both sexes resemble the adult male.</p>\n<p>Voice: the male paradise shelduck gives a di-syllabic goose-like honk when alarmed, or in flight. The main female call is more shrill, and more rapid and persistent, particularly during flight. There are a variety of other calls associated with pair formation and maintenance, territory defence, and maintaining contact with flock birds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: vagrant chestnut-breasted shelducks are very similar to male paradise shelducks. They differ in having a white neck ring, chestnut or buff breast, and black undertail.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The paradise shelduck is New Zealand&#x2019;s most widely distributed waterfowl, when both geographic spread and habitat use are taken into account. It occurs on North, South and Stewart Islands, all large near-shore islands with grassland (e.g. Kapiti, Great Barrier, D&#x2019;Urville) and has straggled to distant Raoul and Lord Howe Islands, and to the Chatham Islands from which an as-yet unnamed shelduck species was exterminated by the first Polynesian settlers.</p>\n<p>Paradise shelducks occur throughout the pastoral landscape, whether high country or lowlands, on river flats in mountain areas, at heads of protected bays or fiords, around the shorelines of all large lakes and hydro-dams, and increasingly on recreational grasslands and parks within urban areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The paradise shelduck is the second-most abundant waterfowl in New Zealand (after mallard). Its numbers are still increasing despite being a gamebird and at least 200,000 being shot annually (2011 figures). The total population probably exceeded 6-700,000 birds in 2011.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The paradise shelduck is so widespread and abundant as to be without conservation threat. Excessive hunting in the past severely impacted numbers, and 2-3 decades of cautious exploitation was required to restore their abundance and expand their distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>When aggregated in large flocks, especially on pastures alongside moult sites or on newly-sown pasture, the grazing impacts of paradise shelducks are regarded as intolerable by farmers. Occasional culling, or harassment of flocks generally alleviates this problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding:</strong></p>\n<p>Paradise shelducks disperse as territorial pairs for breeding, and pairs occupy their territories year-round except when at a communal moult site. Hence birds are invariably seen as single pairs. Pair bonds may persist for several years but are regularly challenged by unpaired individuals. Territories usually contain some water body on which the brood will seek refuge. However, broods can be raised in wet areas without access to open water.</p>\n<p>Females prospect potential nest sites within or beyond the territory in tree holes or bases, rock crevices, under buildings or debris piles and will use almost any site that confers overhead cover and has just a single entrance. Egg-laying is usually in August and September but young birds and some repeat nesters will lay in October, but rarely later. Clutches of 5-15 are reported but most over 12 will have been contributed to by two females. Incubation is by the female only and takes 30-35 days. Both parents guard the ducklings for 55-65 days until able to fly. Parents will perform a broken-wing display to distract mammalian predators and sometimes people. Some broods may amalgamate. The family may remain together for several weeks thereafter, with the bond broken when the parents depart for the communal moulting sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Populations are structured as territorial breeding pairs and flocks, the latter comprising mostly first-year and some second-year pre-breeders. Flocks mostly inhabit extensive river-side pastoral flats or expansive areas of young grass. The annual communal moult extends over January-March. Birds gather in large numbers around isolated or large ponds or lakes, or on expansive riverbeds, to shed all wing feathers.</p>\n<p><strong>Food&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Paradise shelducks are generally herbivorous, with a preference for pasture grasses and clover. An extensive diet has been recorded that embraces a broad range of leaves and seeds of terrestrial herbs, some aquatic plants, and terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Shelduck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Shelduck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/paradise-duck-putakitaki/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/paradise-duck-putakitaki/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/putangi.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/putangi.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/page-5\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/page-5</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Marchant, S.J.; Higgins, P.

It is closely related to the endemic paradise shelduck with which it shares many plumage features. Chestnut-breasted shelducks often fly several hundred kilometres between breeding sites (used in winter and spring), to moulting sites, where they congregate in large numbers. Although apparently faithful to its nesting locations, the place where moult occurs can vary from year to year. Until the 1970s, it was known in Australia as the mountain duck, but is now most commonly referred to there as the Australian shelduck.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The chestnut-breasted shelduck is a large, mostly dark duck with a striking chestnut breast, white neck ring, and chestnut and green speculum. Females have a white eye-ring, and white at the base of the bill. The chestnut breast is darker on the female. The white neck ring of the male is often more sharply demarcated than that of the female. When seen together in pairs, the smaller size of the female is apparent. In flight, the white underwing and forewing are conspicuous, with the same pattern as the paradise shelduck.</p>\n<p>Voice: a series of honks and grunts, similar to paradise shelduck, often very vocal, loud and harsh. The female&#x2019;s call is higher in pitch than the male.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the chestnut-breasted shelduck is most similar to a male paradise shelduck, from which it can be distinguished by the bright and conspicuous chestnut breast and white neck ring, and in the case of female chestnut-breasted shelduck, the white eye-ring and white at base of bill. Note also the dark undertail coverts (these are chestnut in paradise shelducks).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Chestnut-breasted shelducks are largely confined to south-west and south-east Australia. They are spreading northwards in the west of their range, possibly as a result of favourable changes in its habitat due to land-clearing. Chestnut-breasted shelducks disperse widely from their breeding sites, and apart from vagrancy to New Zealand, were recorded on Norfolk Island in the 1980s. They use a wide variety of habitats, including brackish water (and even the sea occasionally), farmland, woodland, crops, irrigation areas, and stubble. Most New Zealand sightings have been on lowland wetlands, often with paradise shelducks.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Chestnut-breasted shelducks were first recorded from New Zealand in 1973 at Hokitika River. There was an influx during 1982-86, with some birds persisting for several years, especially in Marlborough. They have been recorded regularly if infrequently since 2000. Chestnut-breasted shelduck have reached nearly all of New Zealand&apos;s outlying island groups, with records from Raoul Island, Kermadec Islands (1994), Pitt Island, Chatham Islands (1998), Snares Islands (1984), Enderby Island, Auckland Islands (1983-84), and Campbell Island (1984-85). Most records have been of single birds, but occasionally up to three birds. There is one confirmed breeding record, from near Lake Tekapo, where a pair with half-grown young was seen in January 1985. Birds have been seen in most districts of the South and North Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, chestnut-breasted shelducks can often be seen in flocks of up to 1,000 or more. Like paradise shelducks, they are typically wary and difficult to approach, but can become habituated to people in urban settings. They are very upright both on land where&#xA0;they graze at dawn and dusk, and on the water, where&#xA0;they sit very high. Although young birds dive frequently, adults only dive during their moulting period when they are flightless, or when injured or frightened. Chestnut-breasted shelducks usually breed in a down-lined cavity of a hollow tree-limb, but also sometimes in caves or burrows, and sometimes under vegetation. After leaving the nesting hollow, the flightless, downy young may aggregate in cr&#xE8;ches of 20-40, or in extreme cases, a hundred birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chestnut-breasted shelducks can feed by grazing, dabbling or filtering. They consume tubers and other plant material, including of saltbush and samphire, along with a range of crustaceans, insects and molluscs. There are few New Zealand data.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/australian-shelduck-tadorna-tadornoides\">http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/australian-shelduck-tadorna-tadornoides</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/australian-shelduck\">http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/australian-shelduck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Shelduck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Shelduck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Tadorna-tadornoides\">http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Tadorna-tadornoides</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://australianmuseum.net.au/Australian-Shelduck\">http://australianmuseum.net.au/Australian-Shelduck</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gill, B.J.; Bell, B.D.; Chambers, G.K.; Medway, D.G.; Palma, R.L.; Scofield, R.P.

Five of the six extant species have broad distributions in cool temperate and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where they primarily or exclusively inhabit lakes and rivers. The sixth, the now very rare Brazilian merganser (<em>Mergus octosetaceus</em>) once occurred more widely on Brazilian and Argentine rivers. A coastal and marine habitat has been ascribed to the New Zealand mergansers, which contrasts with the habitat of other mergansers notwithstanding the red-breasted merganser&#x2019;s (<em>M. serrator</em>) seasonal use of sheltered coastal bays, coves and estuaries.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Auckland Island merganser, there was a separate merganser species on the Chatham Islands (<em>Mergus milleneri</em>). Merganser fossils from mainland New Zealand cannot yet be assigned to either of the named species.</p>\n<p>The former occurrence of mergansers in the New Zealand region is an as-yet unexplained bio-geographic oddity, and there is uncertainty about the relationships of these mergansers with all others.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The sexes of the Auckland Island merganser were similar to each other, but males were larger and had an obvious and elongated crest. The head and neck were dark brown, the entire upper body dark grey, and the breast and abdomen dull greyish-brown. The upper wings were slate grey, and the lower wing coverts were darker and banded white. The middle secondary flight feathers were white on the outer web and black on the inner web and tips, with the primary flight feathers and inner secondaries tending blackish. The eyes were dark brown, and the upper bill black but with its cutting edge and the lower mandible yellowish-orange; the legs and feet were orange. Immature birds were darker versions of the adults. Ducklings were dark brown-black above with yellowish-white underparts. Their bill, legs and feet were dark olive-brown.</p>\n<p>Voice: &#x201C;Quacking like a duck&#x201D; is the only recorded description of the call of the Auckland Island merganser.</p>\n<p>Similar species: there were no species that the Auckland Island merganser could have been confused with at its last retreat around the coasts of the Auckland Islands. Around mainland New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, the yellow-footed <em>Stictocarbo</em> shags (spotted shag and Pitt Island shag) were (and are) common around coastlines, and were of similar body shape and colouration to the Auckland Island merganser. However, the two shags were slightly larger and had different head colouration and crest formation, and many structural differences if seen at sufficiently close range.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>A total of 27&#xA0;specimens are known to have been obtained from the Auckland Islands. Merganser bones found in natural deposits and Maori middens at sites on North, South, and Stewart Islands&#xA0;are possibly referable to the same species.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>All bones unearthed have been at coastal or estuarine sites, except for Lake Poukawa in inland Hawkes Bay. Auckland Island specimens were obtained at the coastal edge at the heads of the island&#x2019;s eastern inlets and bays. It is possible this species was also a resident of rivers and lakes in pre-human New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The Auckland Island population was probably always tiny, possibly as few as 20-30 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Mergansers were extirpated following Polynesian settlement of New Zealand and Chatham Islands. The Auckland Island population would have been severely diminished by predation by pigs and cats following their release onto Auckland Island in the 1820s, and possibly also by being a food for early sealers at the island. The earnest collecting of specimens for museums, especially in the 1890s, led to the last specimen being seen, and collected, in January 1902, a mere 60 years after the merganser&#x2019;s initial discovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>No nests or eggs were ever recorded and only two broods of ducklings (both of 4 young) were observed. Both broods were seen in January and suggest a late summer nesting period akin to that of other Auckland Island waterfowl.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island&#xA0;merganser pairs were probably strongly territorial, maintaining their territory and relationship year-round. The eastern inlets of Auckland Island and the bays within Carnley Harbour each have a small feeding stream and it is unlikely that more than one pair could have occupied any inlet and bay.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>A specimen collected in 1901 had a 90 mm (&#x201C;3.5 in&#x201D;) koaro (<em>Galaxias brevipinnis</em>), a freshwater fish, in its bill. The gut contents of a preserved carcass at the Natural History Museum, UK (presumably from a specimen collected in 1901 or 1902) comprised &#x201C;macerated fish bones, mandibles of an errant polychaete and an unidentified gastropod&#x201D;.

It and the extinct Auckland Island merganser are the only mergansers known from Australasia and Oceania. Little is known about the Chatham Island merganser as there are no records of it being seen alive. Evidently it became extinct in prehistoric times from human impacts. The Chatham Island species name honours Dr Philip Millener, former curator of fossil birds at New Zealand&#x2019;s national museum, who collected most of the material that is known for the species.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island merganser was smaller than all other <em>Mergus</em> species. Compared with its close relative, the Auckland Island merganser, the Chatham Island species had a shorter skull and beak and larger salt-glands. The Chatham Island bird&#x2019;s wing, pectoral and pelvic bones were also smaller but its leg bones were a similar size to those of the Auckland Island merganser. Most bones of the Chatham Island merganser were 3-6% smaller than those of the Auckland Island species. Compared with other <em>Mergus</em> species, the Chatham Island and Auckland Island mergansers had a lesser ability to fly but they were not flightless. Male mergansers of all species are a little larger than females. Presuming that the Chatham Island species shared key plumage features with its Auckland Islands cousin, the Chatham Island species was probably a relatively dull-coloured bird with a small head crest.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils of the Chatham Island merganser have been found in natural and archaeological sites only on the main Chatham Island and not on the smaller offshore islands. Suitable habitat on Chatham Island would have included the many small lakes, small slow peat-stained rivers and the dominating barrier-bar Te Whanga Lagoon, which comprises 20% of the island&#x2019;s area. The Chatham Island merganser&#x2019;s skeletal proportions suggest that it may have been evolving towards a more sedentary lifestyle.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils suggest that the Chatham Island merganser was once widespread on Chatham Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island merganser became extinct in prehistoric times, and so no records of live birds exist. A few bones have been found in human food middens, and hunting for food by people is the most likely cause of the species&#x2019; demise.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Abundant remains of adult Chatham Island mergansers, and some chick and egg remains, were retrieved from a small cave on the shoreline of Te Whanga Lagoon. This indicates that the cave was a popular nesting site for the species. This might have been expected because other merganser species worldwide are hole-nesters and females carry out all incubation duties.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Other than its nesting behaviour, almost nothing is known of the Chatham Island merganser&#x2019;s behaviour or ecology. The extensive salt glands on the skull of the species suggest that it spent a considerable time in coastal waters, particularly perhaps the saline waters of Te Whanga Lagoon.

Molecular genetic studies show that the Australian wood duck is related to shelducks (<em>Tadorna</em> spp.), not to pygmy-geese (<em>Nettapus</em> spp.) as previously thought from its outward appearance. Vagrants in much earlier times, perhaps during one of the Pleistocene glaciations, are thought to have given rise to the now-extinct New Zealand species, Finsch&#x2019;s duck, <em>Chenonetta finschi</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian wood duck is a sexually dimorphic species, with males and females differing primarily in their head and underbody colour and patterns; the female is also slightly smaller. The adult male has a uniform dark-brown head and neck, with a short black mane down the back of the neck, hence the species&#x2019; other name: maned duck. The lower neck and upper breast are speckled brown and pale grey gradually fading to grey in the lower breast. The mantle and upper back are grey with a faint brown wash. The tail, undertail coverts, and belly are black. The flanks look grey from a distance but when seen close-up are finely vermiculated black on a grey background. In contrast, the female has a lighter greyish-brown head, with two pale grey stripes, one from just above the eyes back to the ear-coverts, the other below the eyes, extending from the base of the bill to the ear coverts. The lower neck, breast and flanks are spotted brown and white, the markings aligned in places, producing a barred appearance. The upper back is grey-brown, becoming darker brown further back. The upper tail coverts are pale brown tinged with grey; the undertail covers are off-white, the same colour as the belly. The tail is black-brown. Both sexes have the same bold wing pattern, with dark primaries that contrast with white secondaries, which create a broad white panel on the trailing edge of the inner upperwing. Males have a narrow speculum of iridescent green or indigo just in front of the white panel (this is brown and only slightly iridescent in females). Both sexes have dark brown-black scapulars that form a stripe on either side of the upper body, separated in turn from the dark central back by a narrow strip of grey body feathers (much browner in the female). Adult males have a non-breeding &#x2018;eclipse&#x2019; plumage that is similar to the female plumage but with less distinct face markings. The bill is short and goose-like, quite deep at the base, grey in both sexes. The legs are grey, tinged light brown, occasionally greenish; the eyes are dark brown.</p>\n<p>Voice: various nasal calls, most commonly a drawn-out <em>mew</em> or <em>new</em> given by female, and a shorter, wheezy <em>wee-ow</em> given by the male.</p>\n<p>Similar species: none in New Zealand, although the striking white wing pattern of a bird in flight might be confused with paradise shelduck, which is bigger, darker, and has white scapulars not secondaries. The grey teal, which shows white on the secondaries above a large greenish speculum, is smaller, slimmer, and browner.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian wood duck is an endemic Australian species, found most commonly along the southeast and eastern part of the continent and in Western Australia. During wet years, many birds move to central Australia to breed. Elsewhere in Australia it is a vagrant. Most New Zealand sightings have been at wetlands, including sewage ponds, rivers, estuaries, and small lakes. In Australia, wood ducks are quite terrestrial, often grazing on lawns and open areas with short grass close to rivers and billabongs.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are accepted records of Australian wood ducks from Glendhu, Wanaka, Central Otago (1910); Orawia, near Invercargill, Southland (1944); Wairau River, Marlborough (1980); Snares Islands (1982-1986); Otapiri, Southland (May 2002); Nelson Sewage Ponds (June 2010); Bromley Sewage Works, Christchurch (January 2011); and Horseshoe Lake, Christchurch (May 2011). These last two or three records may be of the same bird. Several other records have yet to be submitted to the Records Appraisal Committee of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand. A pair bred successfully near Mapua (Tasman Bay) in 2015 and 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, most of the wood ducks banded and subsequently recovered had not moved far from where they were originally marked, but the species is known to be nomadic during exceptionally wet years, when large numbers move inland to breed along flooded creeks and billabongs. The farthest recovery of a marked bird was one shot in north central Queensland, 1720 km from where it was originally banded in south-western New South Wales 17 months earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, wood ducks are largely terrestrial grazers, eating grass, clover, other herbs, and grass seeds; also takes insects, especially on water.

It was herbivorous and terrestrial, inhabiting grassland, scrublands or open forests and with little association with wetlands or lakes. It was stout, thick-legged and had become progressively flightless since its first colonisation from Australia. Finsch&#x2019;s duck was first described from a fossil deposit from the Earnscleugh Cave in central Otago.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Finsch&#x2019;s duck was similar in size to a mallard duck, with thick legs suitable for a terrestrial lifestyle, and reduced wings. It was flightless, or near so. The bill was short and stout;&#xA0;comparative measurements of the nasal cavity and orbit (eye socket) with closely related species suggest that it may have relied on its sense of smell, more than its eyesight.</p>\n<p>Of the few feathers found, most are silvery-greyish and most have vermiculations, but at least one is a more even grey with a black spot at each distal corner, very similar to the feathers on the breast of male Australian wood ducks (<em>Chenonetta jubata</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Finsch&#x2019;s duck was common and widespread throughout the eastern drylands of the North and South Islands, where rainfall was below 1200 mm. In the South Island, it was distributed from Marlborough to the shores of Foveaux Strait with a more patchy distribution in areas with wetter climates, where scattered population lived in upland or river flat grasslands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population, threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Because of its abundance, Finsch&#x2019;s duck is thought to have been an important dietary component of the two large extinct raptors: Haast&#x2019;s eagle and Eyles&#x2019; harrier, and possibly also of the extinct adzebills (<em>Aptornis</em>). It has been suggested that Finsch&#x2019;s duck became reduced in range and population before human settlement. Extinction occurred after Polynesian settlement but there is uncertainty whether they persisted into European times. An unconfirmed report from behind Opotiki during European times described a &#x201C;ruffus&#x201D; coloured bird which may have been a Finsch&#x2019;s duck. Finsch&#x2019;s duck was probably extremely vulnerable to egg predation by Pacific rats, and they were hunted by early Maori. Polynesian rats may have competed for food. While their grassland and dryland habitats were highly modified by burning following human settlement, there is uncertainty regarding whether Finsch&#x2019;s duck would have benefited from the subsequent changes to their grassland habitat.</p>\n<p>Abundant bone deposits of Finsch&apos;s duck have allowed analyses of changes in body proportions over time. These revealed&#xA0;a progressive reduction of wing length by 10% between the Late Glacial (12,000- 10,000 years ago) and the late Holocene (1800 years ago),&#xA0;associated with a reduced ability to fly.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>It is likely that Finsch&#x2019;s duck&#xA0;bred in hollows, tree trunk or fallen logs because these are the preferred breeding locations of the Australian wood duck, its nearest relative.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Finsch&#x2019;s duck was most likely a grazer and browser of vegetation, probably mixed with fallen fruit and some invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Holdaway, R.N. 1989.

All of New Zealand&#x2019;s birds are derived from domestic stock; the wild variety is not present in New Zealand in a captive or wild state.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Muscovy ducks are large, goose-like ducks with highly variable plumage. Most New Zealand birds are either plain white or pied. Pied birds have a green sheen on their dark feathers. Birds with grey and brown colouring may also be present. &#xA0;A small crest may be raised when birds are alarmed. The bill is either pink-and-blackish, or entirely pink, and the base is surrounded by bright red caruncles. They have relatively short legs, and are less mobile on land than other ducks. The legs and feet are partially or entirely pale orange in colour, and the toes have long, sharp claws. The male is much larger than the female, and can weigh over twice as much.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: Generally silent or quiet. The female makes a soft quacking sound; the male makes puffing and hissing noises.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Entirely white birds bear some resemblance to white domestic forms of mallards, and to male greylag geese, but are distinguishable by the red caruncles and body shape. Pied birds are unmistakable. Muscovy ducks can hybridise with mallards; hybrids are highly variable in plumage and have features of both parent species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Muscovy ducks are not considered established in the wild in New Zealand. During the 1999-2004 bird atlas survey, Muscovy ducks were recorded in more than 1 per cent of the New Zealand mainland squares. They are sparsely distributed throughout the mainland on lakes, ponds, slow-flowing streams, and adjacent pasture close to human habitation. An attempted introduction to Adams Island, Auckland Islands in 1865 was not successful.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No population estimates are available. Birds that live in a semi-wild state are bolstered by birds that escape from captivity or are illegally released. They are the second-most commonly kept species of duck in New Zealand (after mallards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Muscovy ducks are not known to have any negative ecological or biological impacts. Because of their grazing habits, it is possible they would cause damage to pastures if they were to increase in numbers. They are not protected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Muscovy ducks nest in tree holes and hollows, as well as on the ground in areas with dense ground cover. The nest bowl is composed of debris and dead vegetation and is lined with the breast feathers of the female, which incubates the eggs and raises the young alone. Feral birds can breed year-round. There may be ten or more of the off-white eggs per clutch, and they have an incubation period of 35 days. Breeding success of New Zealand birds has not been investigated.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As most Muscovy ducks are&#xA0;recently escaped from captivity they not wary of humans and will allow a close approach. They are capable flyers, but are reluctant to do so. Their long claws assist with perching in trees. They do not form large flocks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feral Muscovy ducks often rely on hand-outs from humans. They also graze on grass and herbs, and sometimes take insects and even small vertebrates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy_duck\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy_duck</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Fitter, J.; Merton, D. 2011. <em>Birds of New Zealand</em>.

Nowhere common, it lives at low densities and its shrill &#x201C;whio&#x201D; whistle above the noise of turbulent waters will usher in a long-remembered encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Adults of both sexes are alike, being uniformly slate blue-grey with chestnut spotting on the breast, a pale&#xA0;grey bill with a conspicuously expanded black flap at its tip, dark grey legs and feet, and yellow eyes. During aggressive interactions, or when birds are suddenly frightened, the bill epithelium is flushed with blood,&#xA0;and appears distinctly pink. Males are larger than females, have more breast spotting and more prominent greenish iridescence on the head, neck and back. Immatures are similar to the adults but from late summer to about August their eye is dark, their bill a dark grey and their chest spotting sparse and dark.</p>\n<p>Voice: male blue ducks give a high-pitched wheezy disyllabic whistle, &#x201C;whi-o&#x201D;, from which the Maori name &#x2018;whio&#x2019; is derived. The main female call is a low rasping growl given in response to disturbance or as a threat.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the blue duck is unlike any other species when viewed in close proximity. From a distance and in poor light, its size and shape may be confused with grey duck or mallard from which it can be readily distinguished by its uniform colouration and, if on the water, by its prominent tail tilted upwards and its head held erect.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The blue duck is endemic to New Zealand and present in the North and South Islands only. Its pre-human range extended from high altitude tarns, lakes and rivers to segments of bush-edged lowland rivers and lakes. It is now patchily distributed in rivers in forested headwater catchments along the axial ranges of both islands. Here and there it extends downriver from these refugia into waters of modest gradient (50-80 m fall per km) provided riparian forest persists and the river runs clean.</p>\n<p>Principal physical correlates of habitat presently occupied include a stable river channel, coarse riverbed substrata, high water clarity, narrow stream/river widths, shallow river margins, pool and riffle sequences and forested river margins.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>A slow and insidious contraction of blue duck range continues, especially in remote South Island areas (parts of Fiordland, West Coast, and northwest Nelson) while some substantial population increases have occurred recently in selected areas where persistent and extensive riverside predator control is practised (western central North Island rivers, northern Te Urewera, Motueka region, Paparoa, Te Anau-Milford area). There is a high prevalence of unpaired males on rivers without predator control. The breeding population is unlikely to be more than 1000 pairs (2011 estimate).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Nesting females are especially vulnerable to mammalian predators, particularly stoats and possums, while rats and weka have been implicated in nest and egg destructions. The duck&#x2019;s widespread declines throughout South Island beech (<em>Nothofagus</em>) forests areas has highlighted the insidious effects of mast-seeding of beech trees fuelling a mouse population boom, closely followed by stoat increases and, when mice numbers crash, the predators focus on hole-nesting birds and vulnerable ground nesters like blue ducks.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of small scale riparian predator trapping programmes points to a conservation remedy. However, with blue ducks residing at low densities (an average of 1 pair per km of river), the scale at which this remedy has to be applied to protect remaining populations is daunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Blue ducks are monogamous and fiercely territorial; the territory and pair bond are maintained throughout the year. In the North Island, nesting begins in late August, with the first ducklings usually in late September. Breeding is approximately 3-weeks later in much of the South Island. Renesting is uncommon and rarely occurs later than November. Nests are generally well hidden from above and sites include riverside caves, holes in river banks, at bases of fern clumps or beneath fallen trees. Nests are generally close to the river edge. While the female is incubating, the male waits on the riverside in close proximity to the nest. The pale white eggs (each 60-65 g) are laid at 1.5-2 day intervals (e.g. 5 eggs in 8 days, 6 eggs in 10 days). The average clutch is 5 or 6 (range 3 &#x2013; 8) and the incubation period extends for 33-35 days. Both parents guard the ducklings during their 70-80 days until fledging and the brood is raised entirely within the territory. The mature ducklings gradually disperse from the territory when their parents start their post-breeding moult and are forcibly challenged and evicted by the adults after moulting. Average productivity is 1.3 fledglings /pr/yr.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Blue ducks are generally encountered year-round as territorial pairs dispersed serially along a river, with occasional single males attempting to claim space between widely separated pairs. Once established, the territory is generally held for life. Mate changes (whether of male or female) as a consequence of death or displacement rarely induce a change in territory location and pattern of use. Juveniles first attempt to establish territories near their natal territory. This causes high levels of genetic relatedness within sections of rivers and strong genetic patterning between rivers. Settlement of birds in rivers beyond their natal catchment is very rare.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Blue ducks have a diet comprised almost exclusively of freshwater invertebrates, of which chironomid larvae and cased caddis fly larvae are the most prominent. Essentially any freshwater invertebrate is eaten and there is no evidence of selective feeding. Berries from streamside plants have been recorded in the diet of alpine-dwelling ducks but not elsewhere. During periods of prolonged river spate, the birds scrape at silt-laden rocks consuming silt and periphyton. Ducklings feed on the same foods as adults, and dive in shallow water within days of first reaching the river.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Duck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Duck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/whio\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/whio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/blue-duck-whio/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/blue-duck-whio/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whio.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whio.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/about-us/our-partners/our-national-partners/genesis-energy-whio-recovery-programme/?id=33341\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/about-us/our-partners/our-national-partners/genesis-energy-whio-recovery-programme/?id=33341</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Kear, J.

Some male chestnut teal in eclipse plumage have a pale patch on the flank at the base of the tail, which becomes white in breeding plumage, when their bright chestnut plumage and green head make them very different to grey teal<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Grey teal are a breeding species in Australia, New Guinea, Indonesia, New Zealand, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. They are widespread in New Zealand, with the greatest concentrations in Canterbury (especially Lake Ellesmere), South Auckland, Waikato, Hawkes Bay and Otago. The first specimens in New Zealand were obtained by Sir Walter Buller in 1866 from the Manawatu district, but at that time they were known to be plentiful in Rotorua at Ohinemutu and Lake Rotomahana. Grey teal have been recorded as vagrants on the Chatham Islands (July 1951, December 1998), Snares Islands (November 1987), Enderby Island, Auckland Islands (January 2012) and Campbell Island (October 2012).</p>\n<p>Most grey teal occur in areas below 300 m above sea level and they are rare above 900 m. The preferred habitat is shallow freshwater lakes, lagoons and swamps with extensive marginal cover, but at times birds are seen on salt and brackish water.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The grey teal is one of the most numerous ducks in Australia, and is one of the most common birds shot there in the hunting season, particularly in inland areas, but in New Zealand its hunting is prohibited. The New Zealand population was estimated at 20,000 birds in 1976, and had increased to an estimated 50,000 birds by 2005, with the main increase being 20,000 birds on Lake Ellesmere. Consideration was given to adding the grey teal to the game bird list when the Wildlife Act was reviewed in 2010, but the grey teal remains fully protected in New Zealand. Globally the grey teal is believed to number more than 1,000,000 birds. Grey teal in New Zealand and Australia have a relatively high mortality rate. Particularly in Australia recruitment is erratic. Populations rise very rapidly in times of flooding, but decline during dry periods. Two Australian mortality studies obtained similar results: 60% died in the first year of life, 80% in the first two years and 96% before the end of the fourth year. Similarly for the New Zealand population, it was found that 68% died in the first year of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>In New Zealand at least 6% of the population is shot during the five week hunting season, which is high considering that hunting of this species is prohibited. Introduced mammalian predators, especially ferrets and stoats which are common in wetland locations, are a major threat to adults and their broods. Swamp harriers, eels and rats are also known to take ducklings when on the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia grey teal are adapted to breeding in shallow temporary water; they have no fixed breeding season and can breed at any time of the year when food is abundant. In the dry interior of Australia the bird is extremely mobile and is one of the first ducks to arrive in a locality in preparation for breeding after flooding. In New Zealand, the breeding appears to be seasonal beginning in June and can extend to January. Breeding probably commences at one year of age. Nest sites can be found in tree hollows and on the ground under the bower of tall grasses. They also readily accept nest boxes. Clutches consist of five to nine cream coloured eggs. Egg dumping by other females can increase the clutch size. Pair-bonds are retained from one season to the next. The female incubates, but the male helps in defending the ducklings. Like all ducks there is synchronous hatching.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey teal are very mobile. Movements within New Zealand appear to be random, with birds dispersing in all directions. Some of the movements are achieved in a very short period of time. For example, a teal marked at Mangere in Auckland was shot the next day 125 km away. In New Zealand and Australia rapid changes in numbers can occur at any locality. Local populations can appear fairly constant, but their composition changes as individuals arrive and depart. In Australia, during drought conditions very extensive movements and great mortality occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Grey teal are normally nocturnal feeders but are frequently seen forging at dawn and dusk<strong>. </strong>They feed on small aquatic insects, molluscs and the seeds of swamp plants. Food is obtained by filtering the surface water and the mud. In Australia the bulk of the diet consists of plant material (87-97% by volume), mostly seeds. Insects are eaten throughout the year, but especially in the spring, while mollusca and crustacea are important in the diet only in the autumn and spring. Invertebrates and molluscs are obtained by filtering the surface water and by dredging mud at the waters edge, and seeds are obtained by stripping the plants on the waters edge or near water. In Australia downy chicks feed exclusively on insects but the relative amount decrease to only 30% by four weeks of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Teal\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Teal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=451\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=451</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0AvAnserif/anatidae/1acravan_anas/Anas_gracilis/Anas_gracilis.htm\">http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0AvAnserif/anatidae/1acravan_anas/Anas_gracilis/Anas_gracilis.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Frith, H.J. 1959.

Subsequent New Zealand sightings have mainly been at coastal or estuarine sites, including Karitane, Otago (January 1993), Kowhai River mouth, Canterbury (August 1993), Clutha River, Balclutha (February 2003), Coatesville, Auckland (October 2003), Bromley oxidation ponds, Christchurch (March 2010), and Mangere water treatment ponds, Auckland (May 2010).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The chestnut teal is abundant in south-eastern Australia, and is a game species in Victoria and Tasmania.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Pair bonds may be maintained year-round.

It is the progenitor of the flightless Auckland and Campbell Island teals but all are now recognised as separate species on account of their geographic isolation and their plumage, size and genetic distinctions. The brown teal was an abundant and widespread species 200 years ago, but became highly endangered due mainly to the impacts of introduced predators. It has responded well to management at a few locations, and can be locally common when protected from predators.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Both sexes of brown teal are darkish brown, but they are sexually dimorphic in plumage and size. Males in breeding plumage have an indistinct green iridescence on the head, occasionally a narrow white neck ring, dark chestnut breast, and conspicuously barred light and dark brown flank feathers with a whitish patch at the tail base. Females and juveniles are a uniformly dull but dark mottled brown. Both sexes have a conspicuous white eye ring, dark-grey bill, legs and feet, and dark brown eye. Their wings appear short, their upper and lower surfaces brown and the speculum on the secondary feathers is green.</p>\n<p>Voice: male calls are soft, usually described as trills or piping, given in alarm and in territorial defence. The female has a rasping growl and a high-pitched and rapid quack.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the flightless Campbell Island teal on Campbell and Codfish (Whenua Hou) Islands and Auckland Island teal at Auckland Islands are both slightly smaller with very short wings, and do not become as brightly coloured as the breeding male brown teal. Grey teal and vagrant chestnut teal&#xA0; both have obvious white patches on the upper-wing, whitish under-wings, and red eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Brown teal are endemic to New Zealand and, in pre-human times, may have been the most widespread and numerous of New Zealand&#x2019;s waterfowl. They were also formerly on Chatham Island until about 1925, and Stewart Island until 1972. Brown teal are now mostly restricted to northern North Island (Northland, Great Barrier Island and Coromandel Peninsula) but have been recently re-introduced to Kapiti and Mana Islands and the Zealandia Sanctuary in Wellington, and to a private sanctuary in Hawkes Bay. A recent trial release in Fiordland has returned teal to an area in which a few wild birds lingered till the late 1990s.</p>\n<p>Brown teal formerly exploited a wide range of habitats including wet forests, extensive and occluded swamps, slow-flowing streams, lakes and estuaries. Their present day habitat lies mostly in agricultural environments wherein the birds use occluded stock ponds as breeding and feeding sites, and also margins of small streams that retain overhanging marginal vegetation. Some birds still feed in estuaries on Great Barrier Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The brown teal population was estimated at 1500-2500 birds in 2011. Population estimates for the three principal aggregations in Northland, Great Barrier Island and Coromandel are usually extrapolated from counts of birds at summer flock sites but there remains uncertainty about what proportion of each population assembles at these sites. Recently established populations elsewhere comprise approximately 100 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The brown teal is probably the least secure of New Zealand&#x2019;s three brown-plumaged teals on account of its vulnerability to and exposure to mammalian predators, and to ongoing deterioration of agricultural habitats in which it is forced to reside. Recovery of teal populations on mainland sites requires permanent and assiduous predator control or predator exclusion. Although Great Barrier Island presently lacks mustelids and has limited pastoral farming, expanding human settlements and household pets threaten the population&#x2019;s expansion there.</p>\n<p>Brown teal are extensively bred in captivity for reintroduction attempts, but enduring success of these attempts remains elusive.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Brown teal are monogamous and generally fiercely territorial. Most nesting is in late winter (July-September) but broods have been encountered in most months except late autumn. Typically nests are buried in dry locations deep within bases of rush, grass or fern clumps near water. Large pale fawn eggs, each about 10-11% of the female&#x2019;s body weight, are generally laid daily. The average clutch is 5 or 6 (range 3 &#x2013; 9) and the incubation period extends for about 28 days. Both parents guard the ducklings during their 50-55 days until fledging; the brood is usually raised within the territory.</p>\n<p>The mature ducklings are forcefully evicted from the territory on or about the time the parents start their post-breeding moult.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Brown teal populations generally comprise a single aggregated flock and numerous widely dispersed pairs. Some pairs may occupy exclusive territories year-round in water-rich locations whereas others vacate their territories seasonally and return to them when autumn rains replenish water levels. These territories contain abundant food and escape cover and suitable nesting and brood-rearing habitat. Pairs using streams as territorial sites will forage and nest well beyond the stream margins.</p>\n<p>Flocks arise from mid-summer aggregations of recent fledglings and of early moulted adults whose winter ranges have dried out. Other seasonally displaced adults also join but will leave the flock following autumn rains. Non-breeding birds may remain as a flock through winter and spring.</p>\n<p>Brown teal are generally crepuscular to nocturnal in habit in agricultural and forested environments but at coastal sites feeding and loafing activity may also be influenced by tides, the birds being more active at low tides.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Brown teal diet is diverse. A study from Great Barrier Island recorded 78 taxa including terrestrial, freshwater and marine invertebrates, fungi, and terrestrial and freshwater vegetation. Terrestrial foods included seeds of sedges, clover leaves, cased caddisfly larvae, beetles, caterpillars, moths and earthworms. In inter-tidal areas teal dabbled in soft sediments to extract gastropods and bivalves, crustacean and polychaete worms. They also extract flesh from cockles and small mussels. On freshwater ponds, teal have been observed eating leaves of various wetland plants.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Teal\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Teal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/brown-teal-pateke/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/brown-teal-pateke/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://brownteal.com/\">http://brownteal.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/pateke.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/pateke.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Kear, J.

Teal remain abundant on the smaller islands in the group, but have been extirpated on the main island through predation by introduced cats and pigs. The Auckland Island teal is one of three brown-plumaged teals endemic to the New Zealand region. It is descended from the brown teal of mainland New Zealand but is recognised as a separate species on account of its geographic isolation and plumage, size and genetic differences.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Auckland Island teal is sexually dimorphic in plumage and size. Both sexes are darkish brown, but males have a green iridescence on the head, dark chestnut breast, and conspicuously barred light and dark brown flank feathers with a smudgy white patch at the tail base. Females are a uniformly dark brown. Both sexes have a conspicuous white eye ring, dark-grey bill, legs and feet, and dark brown eye. Their wings are very short, with the main wing feathers extending only about half-way along the back.</p>\n<p>Voice: calls are similar to brown teal. Soft male calls, usually described as trills or piping, given in alarm and in territorial defence. The female has a rasping growl and a high-pitched and rapid quack.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the flightless Campbell Island teal on Campbell and Codfish (Whenua Hou) Islands is smaller and darker, but can only be identified by location. The flighted brown teal on the New Zealand mainland is larger and has relatively and absolutely larger wings that reach to the base of the tail when folded.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Endemic and restricted to the Auckland Islands where it occurs on all major islands except main Auckland Island.</p>\n<p>Auckland Island teal are primarily observed fossicking the shoreline and windrows of kelp on protected shorelines. They also occur along peaty streams and on pools in wetlands with abundant sedge and tussock cover. On Disappointment Island it lives in seepages amongst seabird burrows and mollymawk nests and without access to the shoreline. On Adams Island it can be encountered occasionally in streams high up on the island&#x2019;s southern slopes.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island teal are commonly seen but never numerous. The population is likely to exceed 1000 following their recent increase on Enderby and Rose Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island teal occur on seven pest-free islands but birds have not been able to re-establish on main Auckland Island in the presence of the pigs and cats which contributed to their exterminated there.&#xA0; Eradication of rabbits from Enderby and Rose Islands in 1993 resulted in an increase of teal on both islands following recovery of grasses and rushes along streams and along sheltered shorelines. They are probably the most secure of all three of New Zealand&#x2019;s brown-plumaged teals.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island teal are monogamous and fiercely territorial. Territories along shorelines are the smallest (40 &#x2013; 100 m2) and those covering sparse wave platforms and grassland the largest (1000 &#x2013; 3700 m2). All reproductive activity is confined to territory. Males often loaf conspicuously at the shoreline edge of their territories.</p>\n<p>Egg-laying may commence at end of October and first broods are encountered in early December. Young broods have been observed in March and April suggesting relaying by early failed breeders. Each pale fawn egg weighs almost 15% of the female&#x2019;s body weight which is, proportionately, one of the largest eggs laid by any waterfowl. Incubation of the 3-4 eggs is by the female alone and lasts 30-35 days. The nest site, usually well secreted at the base of tussock or sedge clumps or in fern, is used as a daytime refuge for the growing young. Both adults contribute parental care. Fledging period in the wild unknown but in captivity, ducklings reach adult weight in 50-60 days.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Pairs maintain territories year-round, unpaired birds living furtively between territories or, where windrowed kelp accumulates in sheltered shorelines, as a small flock. Auckland Island teal are generally crepuscular but often roost in full sun in protected locations or where birds have unobstructed vision to see their main predator, the southern skua.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island teal are predominantly carnivorous, feeding on small marine invertebrates, crabs and molluscs, and terrestrial arthropods and their larvae. They also strip seeds from rushes and grass seedheads, and dabble in peaty pools and ooze.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://terranature.org/tealAuckland_Island.htm\">http://terranature.org/tealAuckland_Island.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Kear, J. 2005. <em>Ducks, geese and swans</em>.

Was there such a thing as a Campbell Island teal, or were the few birds seen there stray Auckland Island teal from the islands of the same name, 270 km away? Did a population persist somewhere in the Campbell Island group? These questions were answered in dramatic fashion in 1973, when a tiny population was discovered on Dent Island, a 23 ha islet off Campbell Island. Eleven birds were extracted from this population, in 1983 and 1990, and a captive breeding programme ensued. In 1999-2000 24 birds were released onto Codfish Island off Stewart Island. After rats were eradicated from Campbell Island in 2001, 150 captive-bred and Codfish Island-bred teal were released onto Campbell Island in 2004-06. The captive breeding programme ceased thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Campbell Island teal is the smallest of the three brown-plumaged teals endemic to the New Zealand region. Both sexes are darkish brown, but are sexually dimorphic in plumage and size. Males are entirely dark sepia with a green iridescence on the head and back, dark chestnut breast, a paler brown abdomen and a conspicuous white patch at the tail base. Females are a uniformly dark brown with a paler abdomen. Both sexes have a conspicuous white eye ring, dark-grey bill, legs and feet, and dark brown eye. The wings are very short, with the main wing feathers extending only about half-way along the back.</p>\n<p>Voice: calls are similar to those of brown teal and Auckland Island teal. Male calls are soft trills or piping, given in alarm and in territorial defence. Females have a rasping growl and a high-pitched and rapid quack.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the flighted brown teal of the New Zealand mainland is larger, more colourful when in breeding plumage, and has wings that extend to the base of the tail when folded. The flightless Auckland Island teal at the Auckland Islands is slightly larger and paler, but can only be separated from Campbell Island teal by location.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are endemic to Campbell Island. A small population, sourced from captive-raised birds has persisted on Codfish Island, off Stewart Island, since 1999. The main population on Campbell Island is derived from birds re-introduced in 2004-06, bolstered by natural recolonisations by birds swimming from Dent Island.</p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are considerably more furtive than their Auckland Island relatives. They are most likely to be encountered at the shoreline picking among rocks or any beach-cast seaweed, and along peaty streams and about pools in wetlands with profuse sedge and tussock cover in Perseverance Harbour, Campbell Island. They also occurs on Six-foot Lake, at the head of Northeast Harbour and in Northwest Bay on Campbell Island and at Sealers Bay and adjacent Penguin Bay on Codfish Island.</p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal persist on Dent Island off Campbell Island&#x2019;s Northwest Bay, their sole refuge after rats invaded Campbell Island in the early 1800s. There they survive in tiny numbers in seepages amongst seabird burrows and occasionally straggle across the 3 km sea gap to Campbell Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are secretive at Campbell Island, making population estimation difficult. The most recent attempt to locate birds on the island (2009) indicated a minimum presence of 102 birds. Populations on Dent and Codfish Islands have not been surveyed in the past decade, but both are probably tiny (&lt;30 birds).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The Campbell Island teal came very close to extinction, with a tiny remnant population surviving on Dent Island after Norway rats wiped out the main population on 11,000 ha Campbell Island. The captive-breeding programme took many years to produce any young, and in the end only one of the three wild females brought into captivity produced offspring. The entire captive-bred population is descended from this one female, and the Campbell Island teals has among the lowest level of genetic variation measured in any wild bird population. Any return of rats to Campbell Island would severely threaten this species and most likely force a resumption of past captive breeding efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are probably monogamous and strongly territorial, and with all reproductive activity and feeding confined to the territory. On Codfish Island, egg-laying commences at the end of November, and newly-hatched broods are encountered from early January to February. From 14 nests there, clutch size was 2-5 pale fawn eggs (mean 3.5). On Campbell Island, incubated nests containing clutches of 4 and 5 eggs have been found from mid-November to mid-December.</p>\n<p>Eggs laid in captivity averaged 62 x 43 mm with a calculated weight of 65 g, approx. 15-20% of a wild female&#x2019;s body weight. Both adults contribute parental care. Fledging period in the wild is unknown but in captivity, ducklings reach adult weight in 50-60 days.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are difficult to study in the wild due to the inaccessibility of the sites where they occur, the dense vegetation they inhabit, and the birds&#x2019; furtive and nocturnal behaviour. Pairs probably maintain territories year-round. On Codfish Island a small flock sometimes gathers at the mouth of Sealers Creek. Campbell Island teal are rarely active during the day or venture far from protective cover. At night they have been observed feeding on tidal flats at the head of Perseverance Harbour, Campbell Island and fossicking along the inlet&#x2019;s rocky shoreline.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of Campbell Island teal is unknown in the wild, but they are probably omnivorous with a preference for invertebrates. They have been observed stripping seeds from rushes and grass seedheads and dabbling in peaty ooze and along a stream edge on Codfish Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Website</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Teal\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Teal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/offshore-islands/new-zealands-subantarctic-islands/campbell-island/teal-returned-to-campbell-island/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/offshore-islands/new-zealands-subantarctic-islands/campbell-island/teal-returned-to-campbell-island/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://terranature.org/tealcampbell_island.htm\">http://terranature.org/tealcampbell_island.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=9819\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=9819</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Kear, J. 2005. <em>Ducks, geese and swans</em>.

Its English and scientific names describe the two long black central tail feathers of the drake in breeding plumage. The northern pintail inhabits open, shallow wetlands, breeding across the northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America. It is highly migratory, wintering mainly south of its breeding grounds, almost as far as the equator. Vagrants reach Micronesia, Polynesia and New Guinea, with at least four records from Australia, and a single bird seen in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The northern pintail is a fairly large, slender dabbling duck. It is larger than teal species but smaller than a mallard. The drake in breeding plumage is unmistakable. At a distance it appears a mainly grey with a chocolate-brown head and neck, and with a white stripe extending from the white breast and lower neck up the side of the neck to eye-level. The back and sides have a grey, brown and black pattern, with a creamy patch anterior to the black under-tail coverts. The two black central tail feathers are greatly elongated, making up about a quarter of the bird&#x2019;s total length. The female is brown, but its slender body, long thin neck and pointed tail, together with smallish head with a grey bill, make it recognisable at close range. The male in eclipse (non-breeding) plumage is similar to the female. Both sexes have a fast, graceful flight when the slender body, long neck and tail, and pointed wings are apparent. Both sexes show a dark speculum bordered white at the rear, especially prominent in the female.</p>\n<p>Voice: the male&#x2019;s call is a soft whistle whilst the female has a mallard-like quack.</p>\n<p>Similar species: breeding males are unmistakeable. Females and males in eclipse are smaller than a mallard, with relatively longer necks, grey bills and unstriped, speckled buff faces. The grey teal has similar facial markings (or lack thereof) to northern pintail but is smaller and more compact with a greyer face, red eye and prominent white triangle on the upperwing (northern pintail wing markings resemble those of the mallard).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The northern pintail breeds across the northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America. They are highly migratory, wintering mainly south of the breeding range from about 40&#x2070;N almost to the equator in Panama, Africa and Asia. There have been many cases of lateral migration with birds from Russia and Japan being recovered in North America, and birds from Canada recovered in the United Kingdom. Small numbers migrate from North America to Pacific islands, especially Hawaii where a few hundred winter each year. Vagrants have been recorded in Polynesia, Micronesia and New Guinea with about four records from Australia.</p>\n<p>The breeding habitat is in open, shallow wetlands, whilst in winter it frequents sheltered coastal waters, estuaries, brackish water, as well as shallow, open freshwater wetlands.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>A single record; a male in breeding plumage was discovered on Farewell Spit on 19 October 1997. It was with a small flock of mallards on a flooded pan. The bird was found again two days later but not seen again. The date was consistent with a bird overshooting on its southward migration.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Northern pintails are generally shy and wary. Large congregations can occur on the wintering grounds. Birds feed mostly on plant material taken whilst dabbling, that is, up-ending in shallow water where their long necks allow them to feed in deeper water than other dabbling ducks. Feeding is mainly in the evening and at night, and invertebrates are added to the diet during the breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Pintail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Pintail</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Pintail/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Pintail/id</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=457\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=457</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Marchant, S.J.; Higgins, P.

They have recently been introduced to Mana, Motuara and Blumine Islands, in the Cook Strait region. Before human settlement of New Zealand&#xA0;rowi were widespread throughout the northern South Island and into the southern North Island, as far north as Lake Poukawa (Hawkes Bay). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There were about 375&#xA0;rowi in 2012. The only breeding population is at Okarito; island populations are either used as cr&#xE8;ches or have been established only recently. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rowi&#xA0;disappeared from most of their range in the southern North Island and northern South Island. Since European settlement have been known only from the Okarito area, in roughly the same range as occupied now. Up until the 1990s, they were declining due to recruitment failure caused by predation of chicks and juveniles by stoats, and some adults being killed by dogs and motor vehicles. In 1995, their population was estimated at 160 birds. &apos;Operation Nest Egg&apos; (the removal of eggs or young chicks from the wild and the rearing of chicks and juveniles in captivity and on Motuara Island, until large enough (1.2 kg) to cope with the presence of stoats), allowed the populations to increase to about 200 birds by 2000. A landscape-scale stoat trapping programme in South Okarito Forest from 2001 to 2005 largely failed to protect chicks from stoat predation. Operation Nest Egg was therefore reinstated, and the population has grown rapidly to the 375 birds in 2012. New populations have been established on Mana and Blumine Islands, but birds have yet to breed at these sites. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rowi eggs are laid from July to January. The nest is in a burrow, hollow base of a tree, or in a hollow log. Clutch size is 1, but sometimes clutches can be overlapped with one freshly laid egg and one close to hatching.&#xA0; The pale-green egg is very large. Incubation is shared by male and female, with the male doing most incubation by day and duties are shared through the night. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rowi are flightless and nocturnal. During the day they rest in a burrow, hollow tree or log, or under thick vegetation and emerge shortly after nightfall. They feed by walking slowly along tapping the ground and when prey is detected they probe their bill into the leaf litter or a rotten log; occasionally plunge their bill deep into the ground. Rowi call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners; pairs often duet, with the partner responding a few seconds after the first call has been completed.&#xA0;They are territorial, and fight conspecifics with their sharp claws.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rowi eat mostly small invertebrates, especially earthworms and larvae of beetles, cicadas and moths; they also eat centipedes, spiders, crickets, weta and freshwater crayfish. Some fallen fruit and leaves are eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org/\">http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colbourne, R.M. 2002.

Rufous to dark brown soft feathers streaked with brown and black; long pale bill, short pale legs and toes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice:&#xA0; Male gives a high-pitched ascending whistle repeated 15-25 times, female gives a slower and lower pitched hoarse guttural call repeated 10-20 times.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: rowi are smaller and greyer. The calls of weka are similar to the call of the male tokoeka, but weka have two-syllable calls, and usually have fewer repetitions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sparse to locally common in native forests, scrub, tussock grassland and subalpine zones in parts of the Haast Range and Arawhata Valley; Fiordland, from Milford Sound to Preservation Inlet and east to Lake Te Anau, including many of the larger islands such as Secretary and Resolution Islands; Stewart Island and Ulva Island. Fiordland tokoeka were introduced to Kapiti Island in 1908, where they have hybridised with North Island brown kiwi. Recently, Haast tokoeka have been introduced to Coal and Rarotoka Islands, and to the Orokonui Ecosanctuary, Dunedin, and small islands in Lakes Te Anau and Manapouri are used as cr&#xE8;che sites for this taxon. Before human settlement of New Zealand tokoeka were widespread throughout the southern and eastern part of the South Island as far north as North Canterbury.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 30,000 birds in 2012; Haast tokoeka, c. 350 birds; Fiordland tokoeka, c. 15,000 birds; Stewart Island tokoeka, c. 15,000 birds. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tokoeka disappeared from the eastern part of their range first, and within the last 50 years they have disappeared from northern and eastern fringes of Fiordland. Habitat loss, and predation by dogs and, more recently, by stoats, ferrets and cats have contributed to their decline. At Haast, the population was declining because of recruitment failure due to predation of chicks and juveniles by stoats, and some adults being killed by dogs. Since 2000, an extensive trapping programme and removal of eggs or young chicks from the wild and the rearing of chicks and juveniles in captivity and on predator-free islands until large enough (1.2 kg) to cope with the presence of stoats, has allowed the population to increase from c.300 birds to about 350 birds by 2012. New populations of Haast tokoeka have been established on Coal and Rarotoka Islands and at Orokonui Ecosanctuary, Dunedin. Landscape-scale stoat trapping in parts of Fiordland appear to be halting or reversing the overall population decline. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eggs are laid from June to December. The nest is in a burrow, rock crevice, hollow base of a tree, or in a hollow log. Clutch size is 1 very large, pale green egg. Incubation is shared by male and female, with the male doing most incubation by day, and duties are shared through the night. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tokoeka are flightless and generally nocturnal. On Stewart Island, and occasionally in parts of Fiordland, some birds forage during daytime. During the day, they rest in a burrow, rock crevice, hollow tree or log, or under thick vegetation, and then emerge shortly after nightfall. They feed by walking slowly along tapping the ground and when prey is detected they probe their bill into the leaf litter or a rotten log; occasionally plunge their bill deep into the ground. Call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners; pairs often duet, with the partner responding a few seconds after the first call has been completed.&#xA0; They are territorial, and fight conspecifics with their sharp claws.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tokoeka eat mostly small invertebrates, especially earthworms and larvae of beetles, cicadas and moths; they also eat centipedes, spiders, crickets and weta. Some fallen fruit and leaves are eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblink</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org/\">http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colbourne, R.M. 2002.

By the time of European settlement they had virtually disappeared from the North Island, with only one specimen collected (Mt Hector, Tararua Range, 1875) and another reported from near Pirongia in 1882. Still common in Nelson, Westland and Fiordland through to the early 1900s, but gradually disappeared, leaving a small relict population on D&#x2019;Urville Island. It is believed that five little spotted kiwi were introduced to Kapiti Island from the Jackson Bay area in 1912, and they flourished on the island. Since 1983, birds have been transferred from Kapiti to establish new populations on Hen, Tiritiri Matangi, Motuihe, Red Mercury, Long (Marlborough Sounds),&#xA0;Chalky and Anchor Islands, and to Zealandia/Karori Sanctuary (Wellington). Two D&#x2019;Urville birds were transferred to Long Island (Marlborough Sounds). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 1650 birds in 2012. Kapiti Island is the stronghold for the species, with c.1200 birds; Zealandia 120; Tiritiri Matangi 80; Red Mercury Island 70; Hen Island 50; Long Island 50; Chalky Island 50; Motuihe 30. Twenty birds from Kapiti Island were translocated to&#xA0;Anchor Island (Fiordland) in April 2015.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little spotted kiwi died out in the North Island in the late 1800s, possibly as a result of predation by dogs. The decline and ultimate extinction in the South Island was probably the result of predation by mustelids, dogs and cats. Luckily, a few birds were introduced to Kapiti Island in 1912, where they flourished despite the presence of weka. Transfers to other pest-free sites have been largely successful. Little spotted kiwi have the lowest genetic diversity of the five kiwi species, which is not surprising given that the current population is foundered from a maximum of 7 birds, and most likely just 5 birds introduced to Kapiti Island. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eggs are laid from July to January. The nest is in a short burrow, hollow log, or on the ground under dense vegetation. Clutch size is 1 or 2 large white eggs. Incubation is by the male only.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little spotted kiwi are flightless and nocturnal. During the day they rest in a burrow, rock crevice, hollow log, or under dense vegetation, and then emerge shortly after nightfall. They feed by walking slowly along tapping the ground and when prey is detected they probe their bill into the leaf litter or a rotten log, or pick prey up from the surface; only rarely plunge their bill deep into the ground. Little spotted kiwi call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners; often pairs will duet. They are fiercely territorial, and fight conspecifics with their sharp claws, resulting in a cloud of feathers on the ground.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little spotted kiwi eat mostly small invertebrates, especially earthworms; larvae of beetles, cicadas, flies and moths; spiders, adult beetles and some small fallen fruit and leaves.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org/\">http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colbourne, R.M.; Robertson, H.A. 1997.

A new population has been established near Lake Rotoiti, Nelson Lakes National Park, and very sparse or recently extirpated populations in the Flora Valley (Arthur Range) and Nina Valley (near Lewis Pass) have been supplemented by recent releases. At the time of European settlement they had a similar distribution, except that the Paparoa Range and Southern Alps populations probably linked in the Grey Valley.

The very wet upland and subalpine areas they mainly occupy have lower densities of mammalian predators, and this may have allowed great spotted kiwi to remain locally common in some sites. Hourly call rates across the whole range is slowly declining, but landscape scale management of predators through periodic aerial 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) operations, or trapping, may have slowed or reversed the declines in some areas. The removal of eggs or young chicks from the wild and the rearing of chicks and juveniles in captivity or in predator-proof cr&#xE8;ches, until large enough (1.2 kg) to cope with the presence of stoats, has allowed some populations to increase. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eggs are laid from July to December.

They are common in open shrublands throughout most of the country. The male has a striking black face bordered with white, and a conspicuous top-knot or plume. The female is duller in colour with a less obvious plume. The young are numerous and able to fly at a young age, but have a low survival rate. In autumn, quail gather in large coveys to feed and roost together. The male call, often represented as &#x2018;<em>Chi-ca-go</em>&#x2019;, is distinctive and diagnostic.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail are stocky, predominantly grey and brown, with a diagnostic forward-curling black plume rising erect from the top of their heads. Males have a black chin and cheeks edged with white, and separate white &#x2018;eyebrows&#x2019; join on the forehead. The breast is blue-grey and the lower belly cream to rust brown with distinctive black scalloping, which merges into strong, pale streaks on the dark brown flanks. The female is slightly smaller, duller and browner, with some streaking on the neck and a more subdued scalloping on the belly, but with equally bold streaking on the flanks. Immature birds are similar to the female but a lighter brown. The female&#x2019;s crest plume is much smaller than the male&#x2019;s. Both sexes have fine speckling on the nape, which is bolder in the male. There is no seasonal change in plumage. California quail have short, rounded wings and a relatively long tail. Their legs and bill are black and sturdy, with the bill being slightly hooked. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Foraging quail pace sedately, but when disturbed they run at speed, their feet a blur of movement, or burst into flight with noisy, rapid wingbeats. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Voice: the distinctive 3-note male crow is described in a variety of entertaining ways (&#x2018;Tobacco&#x2019;, &#x2018;McPherson&#x2019;, &#x2018;Chi-<strong>ca</strong>-go&#x2019; etc.). It is more accurately rendered as &#x2018;qua-quergo&#x2019;. The first note may be given by itself. The calling bird is usually perched slightly above the surrounding area, e.g on a log or post. Other calls include foraging grunts, sharp urgent tut-tut warnings and soft tup-tup sounds, possibly location guides. Chicks make a high whistle, alerting parents to their location</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Similar species: the brown quail is smaller and browner, with intricate patterning on the back, and lacks a head plume..</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail are native to western USA from Oregon to the Baja Peninsula. They have been introduced to most continents as game birds. The first release in New Zealand was at Papakura in 1862 with later releases in Nelson, Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury and Otago. They spread rapidly, and are now most numerous from Northland to the Waikato, inland Bay of Plenty, coastal Wairarapa, Nelson/Marlborough, North Canterbury and Banks Peninsula. They are uncommon or absent in&#xA0;Southland, the Southern Alps, the West Coast and the Chatham Islands. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The preferred habitat for California quail is uncultivated open shrubland. They frequent the rough scrubby edges of rivers, inlets, forests, roads and rural gardens. Examples of good quail habitat include bracken, tussock grass, matagouri, gorse, blackberry, tutu and lupin</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail are abundant throughout their range, though they have apparently declined compared to e.g. 1920s Canterbury, when coveys in excess of 100 birds were frequently recorded. It is now unusual to see more than 20 quail in a single covey.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Ecological and economic aspects</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail are not considered to have any conservation or economic impacts, but are hunted on a limited scale. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Breeding </strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Males are aggressive when courting, and often fight each other. Courtship displays include head dips, puffing up of contour feathers, and spreading of the tail feathers. Nests are a flattened grassy area well concealed among dense vegetation. The nest is often placed against a log or rock. The eggs hatch synchronously, partly achieved by the chicks calling to each other while still in the egg. The walnut-sized striped chicks leave the nest as soon as they are dry, and are extremely active, if somewhat uncoordinated as a group. Older chicks keep together in more coherent groups, attended by the parents. The chicks can fly at a surprisingly young age, when about a quarter of the size of the female.. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">In autumn, family groups gather into large coveys, roosting in low branches and separating into smaller groups to feed during the day. When disturbed at a distance, female California quail will crouch motionless, relying on their camouflaged colouration, while the more conspicuous male is more likely to alarm call and flee to a prominent perch. At closer range the covey will run off at speed, or explode into flight en masse, flying a short distance into dense cover. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail consume seeds of many kinds, some fruit and leaves. They feed mainly early in the morning and late in the afternoon, spending more time foraging when food is scarce. The young are insectivorous initially.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Quail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Quail</a></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/southland/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/quail/californian-quail/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/southland/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/quail/californian-quail/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"Body\">Fitter, J.; Merton, D. 2011.<em> A field guide to the birds of New Zealand. </em>Princeton University Press.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2000.<em> The field guide to the birds of New Zealand. </em>Viking, Auckland. </p>\n<p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

The scattered groups of birds found today probably all originated from birds that have wandered off from farmyards. The species has been domesticated for thousands of years, and probably all birds released locally come from domestic stock.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The helmeted guineafowl is a plump chicken-sized bird with a characteristic humped-back appearance. The slate grey plumage is speckled with numerous white spots, the neck is short and featherless, and the small bare head bears a scimitar-shaped bony casque. Skin on the lower face and upper neck is sky blue with red-tipped wattles and a darker blue throat flap. The cere, forehead and crown are red, the bill and casque are horn-coloured, and the iris brown. The lower neck is covered with brownish-grey down-like feathers that extend halfway up the back of the upper neck. Lower down these merge into normal slate-grey body feathers, each of which has a dozen or more uniformly spaced white spots, creating an overall speckled appearance. The flight feathers are similarly patterned, although the dots on the outer webs merge to form fine white stripes that align when the wing is closed, creating a barred appearance. Birds from domestic stock often have whitish facial skin, occasional white flight feathers, and irregular patches of white on the flanks and belly. The legs are dark grey in wild-type birds, and orange-brown in domestic birds; leg spurs absent. Females have shorter and narrower casques and smaller wattles, but are best distinguished by their distinctive, sex-specific call (see below).&#xAD;&#xAD;&#xAD; Young birds are similar to adults but have paler facial skin and less obvious white spots. Chicks are brownish-grey, with black fringes to the body and emerging flight feathers. Their head feathers are brown with longitudinal black stripes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: males give a single, recurring <em>chek</em> note; females produce a distinctive, repetitive two-syllable call <em>buck-wheat</em>, the first note short, second one longer and rising. In both sexes, the rate of repetition of their calls increases when birds become agitated or excited. The alarm call is a repeated, harsh, rattling <em>kek-kek-kek-kek-krrrrrrr</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: adult helmeted guineafowl may resemble adult female and immature wild turkeys and common pheasants but are distinguished by white-spotted grey plumage and a bony casque on the head.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the period 1999-2004, helmeted guineafowl were recorded from less than 1 per cent of the country, mostly around Auckland and farmland around Kaipara Harbour. Some earlier reported populations, such as around Aberfeldy, near Whanganui, no longer exist. Guineafowl do best in areas that have a mosaic of habitats. Populations tend to decline in areas of uniform grassland and pasture, especially where pesticides are commonly used. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The size of the current wild population is unknown but probably small. The history of failed introductions and small, short-lived populations suggest that this species cannot sustain itself naturally in New Zealand, at least under present conditions. There are a number of registered breeders in New Zealand, and an unknown number of owners of domestic guineafowl flocks, both of which can serve as sources of deliberate or inadvertent re-introductions. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Guineafowl can damage emerging seedlings of agricultural crops, but this is offset partly by the number of insects that they eat. Guineafowl are prime gamebirds in other parts of the world, but require careful management to prevent overharvesting.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Guineafowl breed in spring and summer, probably timed so that eggs hatch when arthropods and seeds are most abundant, towards late summer. At the start of the breeding season, a male associates successively with a number of females before pairing with one of them. The pair keep close together for the rest of the season, the male feeding his mate during courtship and guarding her during egg laying and incubation. The nest is a deep scrape lined with grass and detached feathers, placed beneath a bush or in dense cover. Females lay 6-12 cream-brown, pear-shaped eggs that she alone incubates. Larger clutches have been recorded elsewhere, but probably represent eggs laid by more than one female. The shells are noticeably thicker and stronger than those of domestic chickens. Eggs hatch after about 26 days, and the chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, feeding for themselves but copying their parents while following them closely. Both parents brood the young chicks initially. Chicks can fly weakly when 2-weeks old, and become fully fledged about 2 weeks later. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Helmeted guineafowl usually occur in small flocks of 6-20 birds, foraging by walking and pecking or scratching the ground like chickens, calling as they move. Males in flocks often chase each other around, perhaps consolidating their social hierarchy; outright fighting is rare. The birds generally stay close to cover when foraging. If disturbed, they tend to run rather than fly but, when necessary, they will burst from cover in steeply angled flight, giving jarring alarm calls <em>kekkekkekkek</em>. Guineafowl roost in trees at night. Birds gathering before going to roost are noisy, give a mix of <em>kek-kek</em> calls and a softer version of the <em>buck-wheat</em> call.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nothing is known of the diet of helmeted guineafowl in New Zealand. Elsewhere they are omnivorous, eating grass seeds, fruits, leaves, other vegetable matter, and invertebrates. They use their strong legs and toes to grub out bulbs, seedlings, beetles, bugs, and insect larvae; leaves, flower heads and fruits of herbaceous plants are plucked from growing plants. Small lizards, frogs and even small mice are pursued and dispatched with a sharp jab and flick of the bill. Occasionally, birds can be seen jumping a few centimetres off the ground to pluck food items just out of reach. </p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.guineafowlinternational.org/\">http://www.guineafowlinternational.org/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmeted_Guineafowl\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmeted_Guineafowl</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Elbin, S.B.; Crowe, T.M.; Graves, H.B. 1986.

They were introduced from Asia in the 1920s-1930s.

The dorsal surface is well camouflaged in ash grey, more rufous on the crown and shoulders. A prominent black band extends across the forehead, through the eye and down the side of the neck to join above the breast. The cheek and chin area enclosed by the black band is off-white. The flanks are prominently barred with black, white and chestnut. The dark eyes are surrounded in a red fleshy border. The bill is bright red and the legs are reddish-pink.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a strident crow <em>chuck-er-chuck-er-chuckar-chuckar</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the very similar red-legged partridge (<em>Alectoris rufa</em>) is still being bred in captivity and released into the wild, but has failed to establish any wild populations. It differs from the chukor in being browner dorsally, having more chestnut showing in the bars on the flanks, having a more prominent white eyebrow, and having a gorget of black speckling below the black neck band. California quail is smaller, has an erect crest, no barring on the flanks, and males have a black face.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chukor are found in the South Island high country from Marlborough to Otago. They inhabit dry hill country, open shrubland and tussock lands with rock outcrops east of the Southern Alps, up to 2,000 metres. Chukor are occasionally seen at lower altitudes in Marlborough (Cape Campbell). The largest populations are in the Nelson Lakes, Seaward Kaikoura Range, McKenzie country and the ranges of Central Otago. North Island releases (mainly Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and Bay of Plenty) unsuccessful.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No population estimates are available. Populations are widely scattered and fragmented, with many populations apparently in decline.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chukor are not recognised as having any conservation or economic impacts, beyond supporting a limited hunt. They are protected outside the May to August shooting season. It is likely that their numbers are mainly controlled by harsh weather, and predation by introduced mustelids (ferrets and stoats) and native birds of prey (swamp harrier and New Zealand falcon). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chukor form pairs in September, with the breeding season extending to January. The average clutch is 8 but clutches of up to 18 eggs being recorded. The nest is a simple scrape on the ground, hidden under the cover of tussocks or shrubs. Incubation is solely by the female and takes 3 weeks. The chicks leave the nest as soon as they are dry. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Young are cared for in family coveys accompanied by up to 10 adults. Outside the breeding season, chukor have been recorded as forming large coveys of 50 to 150 individuals. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chukor are predominantly vegetarian, foraging for seeds and foliage plus a few invertebrates.

The chin patch is bordered by a black stripe which grades below into a broad spangled black-and-white necklace.

Recently-released birds are mainly reported from South Auckland, northern Waikato and Hawke&#x2019;s Bay. The local Fish &amp; Game Council may know of releases occurring in other parts of the country. Birds are usually released into shooting preserves or on to rough farmland adjacent to areas of shrubland. As many released red-legged partridges are habituated to people, they can be quite approachable, and are often reported from gardens near release sites.</p>\n<p>The natural range of the red-legged partridge is south-western Europe. They have been introduced into many countries, including England, Scotland, Greece, Algeria and the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>A total of 2138 eggs from British suppliers was brought into New Zealand in 1980-81; of these 203 hatched. The first birds were released east of Huntly in March 1984, with over 13,000 released from North Auckland to Canterbury by 1990. The numerous birds held by game farms (in 2015) are all descended from these original birds, with releases continuing (particularly in South Auckland). Despite the thousands of birds released, and some wild breeding occurring, red-legged partridges are not recognised as having a self-sustaining wild population established in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Over $300,000 was spent on attempts to establish red-legged partridges in New Zealand up to 1990, with the largest contribution ($217,549) coming from the Auckland Acclimatisation Society.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Breeding has not been described in the wild in New Zealand, although any unbanded birds seen are likely to have hatched from eggs laid in the wild. In Europe, most clutches comprise 10-16 eggs, which are about 41 x 31 mm, off-white with reddish or grey markings. The nest is a shallow cup lined with plant material, hidden under or among vegetation. Females may lay two clutches, incubating one themselves and leaving the other for the cock to care for independently and simultaneously. Incubation takes 23-25 days, and the chicks leave the nest as soon as they are dry. </p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Young are cared for in family coveys. Most New Zealand sightings are of single birds, but small coveys may be seen soon after birds are released. Males may perch prominently when calling (e.g. on fence posts and railings).</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Red-legged partridges are predominantly vegetarian, foraging for seeds, roots and foliage plus a few invertebrates.

It was the first bird species known to have become extinct following European colonisation. Previously, it was common throughout the North and South Islands,&#xA0;with M&#x101;ori exploiting it as a food source.

Both the female and male had barred white-and-black markings over brown base feathers. The nape varied in colour from brown to rufous-brown in males. The underbody feathers were buff with varying amounts of black barring. The female was slightly larger than the male. Their eyes were light hazel, bill black, and legs and toes pale flesh brown. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand quail was widely distributed throughout the main islands of New Zealand, especially where there was grassland habitat. It was most abundant in the South Island, especially east of the Southern Alps. Its distribution expanded after the arrival of Maori, who burnt large areas of forest thus creating grassland. By the mid-1800s, it had become scarce in the North Island and decreased rapidly in Canterbury as the result of agricultural conversion of the grasslands, and hunting. It was presumed extinct by 1875. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand quail was primarily an open-country bird, with fossil evidence and early historical records indicating that its preferred habitat was grassland and shrubland. As with other <em>Coturnix</em> species, the New Zealand quail had very stout legs and a torpedo-shaped body with which to run through thick grass and undergrowth. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Both archaeological and European historical records indicate that the quail was widespread throughout New Zealand, apparently living in extended family coveys. Before the arrival of humans, quail coexisted with a wide range of potential avian predators. After Polynesian settlement, quail were subjected to hunting and potential predation by Pacific rats (kiore) and kuri (Polynesian dogs). New Zealand quail became extinct before ship rats, stoats and ferrets were widespread, but they were exposed to about 100 years of predation by Norway rats and feral cats, as well as vastly increased hunting pressure following the introduction of guns. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The nest of the New Zealand quail was a cup-shaped indentation of flattened grass that was well concealed. The striped barring of the back feathers of the incubating adult (most probably the hen) blended perfectly with the ground cover surrounding the nest. The timing of breeding and the length of the breeding season is unknown. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Early European hunters described the call of the New Zealand quail as &#x2018;<em>twit, twit, twit, twee-twit&#x2019;</em>. Buller stated that quail were very common, and that daily bags of 40 or more birds were not uncommon. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little is known about the diet of the New Zealand quail. It was apparently mainly herbivorous, feeding on seeds, flowers and foliage. The closely-related stubble quail in Australia also takes adult insects, caterpillars and small frogs, as well as seeds and foliage. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Quail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Quail</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Buller, W.L. 1888. <em>A history of the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It is now mainly confined to East Cape, the Coromandel Peninsula, North Auckland and Northland, plus Moutohora/Whale Island, several islands in the Hauraki Gulf and north to the Three Kings Islands, with scattered records south to the Manawatu. There are no records of quail being introduced to offshore islands, which indicates they are capable of flying considerable distances. Brown quail became common on Tiritiri Matangi Island and in Tawharanui and Shakespear Regional Parks following eradication of introduced predators.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail are cryptically coloured to blend with their preferred habitat of scrub and rough grassland. In both Australia and New Zealand, brown quail are frequently seen around wetland margins and on road verges.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The largest populations of brown quail are in the Far North and on introduced-predator free islands of the Hauraki Gulf and the Bay of Plenty. The population on 220 ha Tiritiri Matangi Island is estimated to be 200-300 birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail form breeding pairs in spring. Eggs are laid between July and January in a simple scrape in the ground or flattened grass, Nests are well hidden under dense vegetation, and both they and the&#xA0;incubating female are very difficult to detect. Once hatched, the precocial chicks gather in&#xA0;extended family group coveys. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail give a range of shrill, piercing calls that carry through thick undergrowth and are used to bring covey members together. Outside the breeding season, the family group breaks up and most quail are observed as pairs. Brown quail do not defend territories but do occupy a defined home range. In Australia, brown quail are nomadic, moving between suitable habitat for foraging and breeding. Brown quail often dust bathe in open dry sunny patches on the edges of shrubland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail glean from low foliage and forage in leaf litter for seeds, leaves, flowers and invertebrates. Analysis of faecal samples showed a high proportion of invertebrate parts. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Quail\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Quail</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/quail/brown-quail/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/quail/brown-quail/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=200\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=200</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australian Museum. 2005.
