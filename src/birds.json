They evolved into a wide variety of sizes to become the largest terrestrial herbivores in prehistoric New Zealand. Together they represent the most diverse radiation of any New Zealand endemic bird group. DNA study shows the moa radiation occurred principally in the South Island, coinciding with the accelerated uplifting of the Southern Alps and the resulting increase in habitat diversity across New Zealand circa 5 - 8.5 million years ago. All the moa species became extinct abruptly, 500-600 years ago, as a result of human overhunting. DNA study suggests that moa&#xA0;were more closely related to the flighted South American tinamou than to the kiwi.</p>\n<p>The upland moa was a relatively small, agile moa species that was once common in the South Island subalpine zone, especially north-west Nelson, Otago and Fiordland. It was rarer in eastern and lowland areas. The only species in the Family <em>Megalapterygidae</em>, it was distinct from other moa species in its smaller, less bulky build and feathered lower legs. Its long, slender toes may have been adapted for walking across snow. Its bill was more pointed than in most moa species and its mummified remains show it had two types of feathers: some with a greyish-white base, becoming blacker and ending in a white tip, giving a mottled effect, and others with a plain or slightly streaky appearance. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A relatively small, slender moa with mottled plumage covering the whole body, extending to the base of the bill and covering the lower legs. The head was relatively small, with a delicate, pointed, slightly decurved bill, and relatively large nostril and ear openings. Upland moa had three, long muscular, forward-turned toes, each with thick, pointed claws, and one reduced backward-turned toe.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: closest in size to Mantell&apos;s moa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Island only. Formerly widespread and common in the subalpine zone up to 2,000 m above sea level in high country herbfields, tussocklands and montane forest, from north-west Nelson and the Kaikoura Ranges, south to Fiordland and Otago.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main cause of extinction was overhunting by humans for food. The remains of moa are widespread in middens, along with specialised tools used to cut up moa carcasses and to work bones into tools. Moa chicks may have been killed by the introduced Polynesian dog (kuri). Before human arrival, upland moa were preyed on by Haast&apos;s eagle.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DNA evidence and egg shell and bone remains found at rock shelter sites in north and central Otago suggest upland moa once nested in rock shelters throughout this region. Plant remains found at nest sites strongly suggests that they built the nests in late spring-early summer. The plant remains found show they clipped twigs 20-60 mm long and up to 4.7 mm wide from a range of locally available trees and shrubs, using their bill. These twigs were then used to build a nest that was a shallow bed of clipped twigs, coarse vegetation and stripped bark. Nesting in rock shelters suggests that they bred as solitary pairs, rather than in colonies. One or two dark olive to pale green eggs were laid per breeding season. The relatively large eggs (likely to have been about 162 x 111 mm) in comparison with body size suggest a long incubation period, probably more than two months. The male is thought to have incubated the eggs, as they do in most other ratites. Chicks were probably able to forage for their own food soon after hatching.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This relatively small moa species was more agile than other moa. It lived mainly in the subalpine zone, including rocky subalpine sites such as the tops of Mt Owen and Mt Arthur in north-west Nelson. It ate a wide variety of alpine herbs and browsed southern beech and small shrubs in montane forests. The best preserved mummified remains of moa are of this species, and were found in relatively dry, enclosed rocky subalpine sites. Some of these remains show signs of &quot;shock moult&quot;, the first evidence of feather moult in any moa species. It is possible that moa plumage colouration and marking were driven by selection pressure to avoid predation by Haast&apos;s eagle.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The diet included leaves and small woody branchlets of many species, including southern beech, nectar-rich flowers of species such as flax and tree fuchsia, and subalpine herbs and small shrubs in open herbfield and grassland habitats.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_Moa\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_Moa</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Listen</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/audio/2552869/coprolites-and-extinct-moa\">http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/audio/2552869/coprolites-and-extinct-moa</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, A. 1989. <em>Prodigious birds: moas and moa-hunting in prehistoric New Zealand</em>.

Slender with relatively long legs, it inhabited dense forest and shrubland. It was the only species in the genus <em>Anomalopteryx. </em>Its relatively short, sharp-edged bill appears to have been more suited to cutting than those of other moa species. This attribute and the large number of stones typically found in the bird&apos;s gizzard, suggest that it had a woody, fibrous diet. It appears to have lived singly or in small groups at a suggested density of one pair per square kilometre. It was probably preyed on by both Haast&apos;s eagle and Eyles&apos; harrier in the South Island, and the larger Eyles&apos; harriers of the North Island.

As its Latin name suggests, the heavy-footed moa was a mammoth moa species, complete with shaggy hair-like feathers, a long trunk-like neck, and elephantine feet. It was the heaviest moa species relative to height, and laid the second largest moa eggs yet found. Like a woolly elephant, its large bulky body would have helped it bulldoze through vegetation, and its large size and shaggy feathers would have helped it cope with cold temperatures. A large olfactory chamber suggests it had an acute sense of smell, which may have been an adaptation for a partly nocturnal life. Study of feathers from mummified remains suggests that heavy-footed moa had speckled patterning similar to the upland moa, or they were plain or slightly streaked. They were preyed on by Haast&apos;s eagle, and their bones are known from widespread midden sites. All nine moa species became extinct abruptly, 500-600 years ago, as a result of human overhunting.

Here it shared the lowland forests, shrublands and wetland edges with three other large moa: South Island giant moa, stout-legged moa and eastern moa.

Its remains are abundant in archaeological sites, indicating that it was hunted for food. It was probably preyed on by the large North Island Eyles&apos; harrier. The species was named after&#xA0;Walter Mantell, a pioneering New Zealand naturalist, government administrator and politician of the 1800s. DNA study suggests that moa&#xA0;were more closely related to the flighted South American tinamou than to the kiwi.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mantell&#x2019;s moa was a robust, small moa. As with several moa species, adult females were much larger than males.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: of the four moa species that occurred in the North Island, Mantell&#x2019;s moa was most likely to have been confused with the equally small but more slender little bush moa, or small individuals of the stout-legged moa. It differed from the latter in being stouter, with a more elongated skull.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mantell&#x2019;s moa was endemic to the North Island, where it was mainly found in lowland areas, particularly wetlands and dunelands, including in the Far North, coastal Taranaki, and Hawke&#x2019;s Bay.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bones of Mantell&#x2019;s moa are abundant in archaeological sites, indicating that it was widely hunted for food.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main cause of extinction was overhunting by humans. Moa chicks may also have been eaten by the introduced Polynesian dog (kuri).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The scant information deduced about moa breeding ecology is also likely to apply to Mantell&#x2019;s moa, namely delayed maturity, pairs breeding well separated from each other, small clutch size, male-only incubation, and a long incubation period.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little is known about the ecology of Mantell&#x2019;s moa. It was probably preyed on by the large North Island form of Eyles&apos; harrier.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The sturdy bill of Mantell&#x2019;s moa suggests that it had a fibrous diet.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantell%27s_Moa\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantell%27s_Moa</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, A. 1989. <em>Prodigious birds: moas and moa-hunting in prehistoric New Zealand</em>.

They evolved into a wide variety of sizes to become the largest terrestrial herbivores in prehistoric New Zealand. Together they represent the most diverse radiation of any New Zealand endemic bird group. Moa were unique among birds in lacking any wing bones. Like other flightless ratites, such as the New Zealand kiwi, Australian emu and Australo-Papuan cassowaries, they had no tail and lacked a keel on the sternum (the attachment point for wing muscles in other birds). All the moa species became extinct abruptly, 500-600 years ago, as a result of human overhunting. DNA study suggests that moa&#xA0;were more closely related to the flighted South American tinamou than to the kiwi.</p>\n<p>The eastern moa was common in the eastern South Island. It was sufficiently distinct from other moa to be placed in its own genus. This species and the larger stout-legged moa were remarkable in having a very long elongated windpipe, which probably enabled them to make louder, more resonant calls than those of other moa. The windpipe included a loop up to one metre long that ran downwards inside the left side of the body, and across to the other side before it doubled back on itself to the breast and into the lungs. Modern day swan, crane and some spoonbill species also have elongated windpipes, and this explains their resonant, bugling calls. Only male eastern moa appear to have had an elongated windpipe, and so their calls may have had a role in sexual selection and competition for mates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The eastern moa was a relatively short-legged, bulky, medium-sized moa. It had a relatively small head, and a delicate, pointed, slightly decurved bill. It had thick legs and very wide feet. The shaggy body feathers extended on to the upper leg, but were sparse on the neck, which had scaled skin with raised papillae. Adult females were 15-20% larger than adult males. Size increased towards the south of their range, and also&#xA0;during colder glacial periods.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: unknown, but probably relatively loud and far-carrying.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the larger, bulkier stout-legged moa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The eastern moa lived in lowland forest and wetland habitats up to 200 m above sea level in the South Island. It was common in dunelands, grasslands, shrublands and mixed forest in the east from the Wairau River south to Southland and Central Otago, and inland to the foothills of the Southern Alps.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main cause of extinction was overhunting by humans for food. The remains of moa are widespread in middens, along with specialised tools used to cut up carcasses and to work bones into tools. Middens dating from the thirteenth century, surveyed at the Wairau River bar in the Marlborough district, contained remains of more than 4,000 individual moa and large numbers of moa eggs. Eastern moa was the second most abundant species recorded at the site after stout-legged moa. Moa chicks may have been eaten by the introduced Polynesian dog (kuri). Burning of the eastern moa&apos;s forest and shrubland habitat is also likely to have reduced its numbers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DNA evidence and egg shell and bone remains found at rock shelter sites in north and central Otago suggest that eastern moa once nested in rock shelters in this region. Plant remains found at nest sites strongly suggests that they built the nests in late spring-early summer. The plant remains found show that eastern moa clipped twigs 20-60 mm long and up to 4.7 mm wide from a range of locally available trees and shrubs. These twigs were used to build a nest consisting of a shallow bed of clipped twigs, coarse vegetation and stripped bark. The constrained space of rock shelters containing nest remains suggests that they bred as isolated pairs, rather than in colonies. Probably one or two eggs were laid per breeding season. The relatively large eggs (likely to have been about 180 x 132 mm) in comparison with body size suggest a long incubation, probably exceeding two months. The male is thought to have incubated the eggs, as is the case with most other ratites. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Its short, thick legs and very wide feet suggest that the eastern moa moved relatively slowly. The eastern moa and the larger stout-legged moa were remarkable in having a very long elongated windpipe, which probably enabled them to make louder calls that carried further than those of other moa species. Eastern moa appear to have been browsers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Soft leaves and fruits rather than the fibrous material eaten by other moa species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Moa\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Moa</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, A. 1989. <em>Prodigious birds: moas and moa-hunting in prehistoric New Zealand</em>.

In the Far North individuals of this species were some of the smallest moa known, but in the South Island birds of the same species were large and robust.

They had thick legs and very wide feet. Adult females were, on average, almost twice as large as adult males. Both sexes were much larger in the south of the species&#x2019; range. Feathers on mummified remains suggest that stout-legged moa had plain or slightly streaked plumage.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: unknown, but probably loud and far-carrying.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the eastern moa was confined to the South Island, and was smaller and less bulky than those stout-legged moa that shared its range. Mantell&#x2019;s moa (North Island&#xA0; only) was smaller but more robust, and had a more elongate skull.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Stout-legged moa occupied lowland open forest and coastal sites with drier climates across most of the North Island, Aotea/Great Barrier Island, and eastern lowland regions of the South Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Stout-legged moa were common in both the North and South Islands. Middens at the Wairau River bar, Marlborough, dating from the thirteenth century, contained remains of more than 4,000 individual moa and large numbers of moa eggs.

One or two eggs were probably laid per breeding season. The relatively large eggs in comparison with body size suggest a long incubation, probably longer than two months. Two moa eggs from Doubtless Bay (average dimensions 121 x 94 mm) are likely to be from the small northern population of this species.

Adult females stood up to 2 metres high at the back, and could reach foliage up to 3.6 metres off the ground, making them the tallest bird species known. It was one of two species of giant moa, the other being the smaller North Island species, which are placed in a separate family from the two families containing the seven smaller moa species. All nine moa were unique among birds in having no trace of wing bones. DNA study suggests all moa species were more closely related to the flighted South American tinamou than to the New Zealand kiwi. They were the dominant New Zealand land vertebrates, exhibiting far greater adaptive radiation than other New Zealand landbirds. Regrettably, all were extinct within a few centuries of human arrival.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moa radiation occurred principally in the South Island, where seven species occurred (five endemic), though it was unusual to have more than four species present at any one site. In contrast, the North Island had only four moa species, including two endemic species. Radiation of moa was coincident with the accelerated uplifting of the Southern Alps and the resulting increase in habitat diversity across New Zealand c.5 - 8.5 million years ago, which may explain the greater moa diversity in the South Island.</p>\n<p>South Island giant moa ranged widely across all vegetated habitats from coastal dunes to inland shrublands, forests, and subalpine herbfields and grasslands in the South Island and on D&apos;Urville Island. Both the giant moa species (genus <em>Dinornis</em>) had longer, stronger necks than the other moa species, with three extra vertebrae. They exhibited the greatest size difference between the sexes of any bird species, with adult females much larger than males. Birds that inhabited lowland shrubland were larger than those from upland forests.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The South Island giant moa was a very tall, relatively slender moa with a relatively small, broad, flattened head, and robust, flattened, slightly decurved bill. Females were markedly larger than males, being c.150%&#xA0;the height&#xA0;and c.280% the weight. The few feathers attributed to this species indicate that it had a plain or slightly streaky appearance.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the South Island giant moa was much taller and relatively more slender than the other large South Island moa species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Island giant moa were found&#xA0; in the South Island,&#xA0;Stewart Island&#xA0;and D&apos;Urville Island, in&#xA0;wide range of vegetated habitats including&#xA0;coastal dunes,&#xA0;inland shrublands, forests, and subalpine herbfields and grasslands. Bones recovered from caves, dunes, swamps and middens show that it was widespread in the eastern South Island from coastal Marlborough south to Southland, and inland to the subalpine zone.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Island giant moa were widespread and abundant.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before human arrival, the South Island&#x2019;s main predator was the giant Haast&#x2019;s eagle, also now extinct. Giant moa were rapidly hunted to extinction by early Maori. Their bones are widespread in middens, and were also shaped into tools and ornaments. Estimates of the number of individual moa remains in 1,200 open ovens and middens surveyed in the vicinity of the Waitaki River mouth during the 1930s range from 29,000 to 90,000. Moa chicks may also have been eaten by the introduced Polynesian dog (kuri). Burning of the giant moa&apos;s dry forest and shrubland habitat is also likely to have reduced their numbers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DNA evidence and egg shell and bone remains found at rock shelter sites in north and central Otago suggest South Island giant moa nested in rock shelters in this region. Plant remains found at nest sites strongly suggests they built nests in late spring-early summer. The plant remains found show they clipped twigs 20-60 mm long and up to 4.7 mm wide from a range of locally available trees and shrubs. These twigs were used to build a nest consisting of a shallow bed of clipped twigs, coarse vegetation and stripped bark. Nesting in rock shelters suggests they bred as isolated pairs, rather than in colonies. A large white giant moa egg (240 x 178 mm) thought to be of this species was found associated with a Maori burial site in Kaikoura. It is estimated the egg would have weighed 4 kg fresh and is the largest moa egg found so far. One or two eggs were probably laid per breeding season. The extremely large eggs suggest an incubation period longer than two months. The male is thought to have incubated the eggs, as is the case in most other ratites. Chicks were probably able to forage for their own food soon after hatching.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Island giant moa may have been the tallest birds known, but the largest of the extinct elephantbird species of Madagascar was heavier, possibly up to 340 kg. Giant moa were the largest herbivore in prehistoric South Island terrestrial ecosystems. Finds of relatively large gizzard stones and their large robust bill suggest that giant moa were able to process a highly fibrous diet. The relatively large olfactory chamber suggests an acute sense of smell. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The diet of the South Island giant moa included twigs, leaves, flowers, berries and seeds from the smaller branches of trees and shrubs, and herbs and vines. DNA study shows that South Island giant moa in central Otago consumed a wide diversity of herbs and shrubs, reflecting local vegetation patterns and ground-level grazing of herbaceous plants.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Giant_Moa\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Giant_Moa</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, A. 1989. <em>Prodigious birds: moas and moa-hunting in prehistoric New Zealand</em>.

At the time of European settlement they had a wider distribution, especially in North Auckland and the Waikato. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 25,000 birds in 2008; 1000 on the Coromandel Peninsula, and the rest evenly split between the Northland, Eastern and Western taxa. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">North Island brown kiwi have disappeared from many lowland sites and around the fringes of their distribution, through a combination of habitat loss and predation by mammalian predators, especially dogs, ferrets and stoats. Hourly call rates across the whole range is slowly declining, but landscape scale management of predators through periodic aerial 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) operations, or trapping, has slowed or reversed the declines in many areas. The removal of eggs or young chicks from the wild and the rearing of chicks and juveniles in captivity or in predator-proof cr&#xE8;ches, until large enough (1.2 kg) to cope with the presence of stoats, has allowed these populations to increase, or allowed releases into areas where the population had dwindled or become locally extinct. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eggs can be laid in any month, but the peak of laying is from June to November. The nest is in a short burrow, rock crevice, hollow base of a tree, or in a hollow log. Clutch size is 1-2. The white egg is very large. Incubation is by the male only. Eggs are left unattended during the night, but the time that the male is off the nest declines as incubation progresses. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown kiwi are flightless and nocturnal. During the day they rest in a burrow, hollow tree or log, or under thick vegetation and emerge shortly after nightfall. Feed by walking slowly along tapping the ground and when prey is detected they probe their bill into the leaf litter or a rotten log; occasionally plunge their bill deep into the ground. Call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners; pairs often duet, with the partner responding a few seconds after the first call has been completed.&#xA0; They are territorial, and fight conspecifics with their sharp claws.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown kiwi eat mostly small invertebrates, especially earthworms and larvae of beetles, cicadas and moths; they also eat centipedes, spiders, crickets and weta, Some small fallen fruit and leaves are eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org/\">http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colbourne, R.M. 2002.

Its main breeding grounds are on the remote Bounty and Antipodes Islands. Individual birds are found moulting on the east coast of the South Island most summers.</p>\n<p>This species has one of the most bizarre breeding systems of any bird, yet the details are poorly known due to its remote and inhospitable breeding locations. It has the most extreme egg size dimorphism of any bird, with the second egg of the clutch averaging 81% larger than the first egg. The purpose (if any) of the first egg remains unclear, with nearly all pairs losing the smaller first egg around the time the second egg is laid. Much of this egg loss is deliberate, with incubating birds lifting eggs out of the nest bowl, or pushing them out with their bills.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>A medium-large crested penguin, about four times the size of the familiar little penguin, and slightly larger than the similar Snares crested penguin. Erect-crested penguins have black backs, faces and throats, sharply demarcated from the white underparts. The large orange-brown bill has prominent pale blue-white skin around the base. Yellow eyebrow stripes start between the nostril and gape and rise obliquely over the red-brown eyes. From the front, the two crests are roughly parallel. Immature birds have smaller, darker bills and paler eyebrow stripes (almost white), and often have a pale chin.</p>\n<p>Voice: a booming bray, lower pitched than other crested penguins.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Snares crested penguin has a more swollen-looking orange bill when adult, and pinker skin around the base of the bill. Snares crested penguins have crests starting nearer the nostril and passing back roughly in line with the bill. From the front, the crests of Snares crested penguins make a &#x2018;V&#x2019;, compared to the more parallel crests of the erect-crested penguin. From the side, Snares crested penguins have a relatively small chin and a flatter crown.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Erect-crested penguins only come to land to breed and moult. Almost all the birds breed on three islands in the Antipodes Island group and eight islands in the Bounty Islands. A few birds have laid on Campbell Island (1940s) and Disappointment Island, Auckland Island (1976), and a pair bred unsuccessfully on Otago Peninsula in 1938 and 1939, with the female continuing to visit and lay most years up to 1946. There are no recent breeding records away from the Antipodes and Bounty Islands.</p>\n<p>Colonies on Antipodes Island are on the rocky coastal margin. The Bounty Islands are almost completely devoid of vegetation, and the penguins nest anywhere they can reach that is not claimed by fur seals or Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks. On Antipodes Island, eastern rockhopper penguins breed on the inland margins of erect-crested penguin colonies. The larger erect-crested penguins are often seen among eastern rockhopper penguin colonies on the Auckland and Campbell Islands.</p>\n<p>Erect-crested penguins are assumed to be pelagic during the non-breeding season. Vagrant birds, mainly moulting during January-February, are regularly recorded from the Snares Islands (up to 35 per annum), Chatham Islands (max 4), Auckland Islands, Campbell Island, Macquarie Island and the east coast of the South Island. They are more rarely reported from Wellington, Wairarapa and Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, and are extreme vagrants to Northland (New Zealand), southern coasts of Australia, Kerguelen Island and the Falkland Islands, where a bird formed a mixed pairing with a western rockhopper penguin.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>About 42,500 pairs breed on the Antipodes Islands (2011 estimate), and 26,000 pairs on the Bounty Islands, with a world population of about 68,500 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The breeding islands are free of introduced predators (mice on Antipodes Island are not considered a threat), and there are no recognised interactions with fisheries. However, historic photographs show that some Antipodes colonies are now much smaller. This probably reflects changes in local oceanographic productivity, requiring adults to swim further to find food for their chicks and thereby reducing breeding success. The conservation status of this species was changed from Naturally Uncommon to Declining in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>No single study has followed a full breeding season. Adults return to breeding colonies on Antipodes Island in September and lay in early-mid October. The second egg is 17-138% larger than the first (mean 81% larger), and is typically the only egg incubated full term. In relation to female bodyweight, the first egg is exceptionally small (2.8%) and the second egg is comparable in size to those of other crested penguins (5.1%). In a 1990 study, 97% of pairs had lost their first egg within 4 days of clutch completion, with 58% of pairs losing the smaller egg on the day the second egg was laid. Egg loss was witnessed on 13 occasions: 3 birds lifted the egg out of the nest bowl with their beaks, 3 stabbed or pushed it out, 6 birds lost eggs while rearranging the eggs by shuffling the body and feet, and 1 while rearranging eggs with a closed beak. Birds attempting to incubate 2 eggs were much more restless than those that had already reduced their clutch to a single egg. Egg loss was not associated with aggression. A similar study in 1998 failed to observe deliberate egg rejection, and considered egg loss to be a consequence of the mechanical difficulties associated with trying to incubate two such disparate-sized eggs.</p>\n<p>Both adults share incubation and care of the young. Eggs hatch in mid November. Chicks are guarded for c.3 weeks, then form cr&#xE8;ches for about 6 weeks before departing the island in late January and early February (peak 30 January). The breeding season on the Bounty Island was reported to be 2-3 weeks later than on the Antipodes in 1978, but similar to the Antipodes Island schedule in 2012.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Erect-crested penguins are colonial breeders, and typically forage in small flocks when close to their breeding islands. Their distribution at sea is poorly known, but is likely to be mainly south-east of New Zealand and north to the Chatham Islands. Adults moult at breeding colonies in late February through to early April. Non-breeders (mainly young birds) moult among the breeding colonies in February through to early March. Each bird stays ashore for the 26-30 days required to complete moult.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Erect-crested penguins catch and eat small crustaceans and squid.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Davis, L.S. 2001.

It is most closely related to the royal penguin, and shares the same scruffy golden yellow crest feathers, that meet on the forehead, quite unlike the paired eye-brow stripes of all other crested penguins. The species was given its name by 19th century sailors after members of the &#x2018;Macaroni Club&#x2019;, a pejorative term for young men with outlandish tastes or fashion sense. DNA analysis indicates that the macaroni penguin split from the royal penguin approximately 1.5 million years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The macaroni penguin and royal penguin are the largest crested penguins, and both have foppish orange-yellow masses of crest feathers that meet on their foreheads (cf. all other crested penguins). The macaroni penguin differs from the royal penguin in having a blackish face (cf. white or pale grey in the royal penguin). The macaroni penguin has a black head, throat and back, sharply contrasting with the silky white underparts. The flippers are long and blue-black with a white trailing edge on the upper surface, and white underneath. It has a large, robust orange bill with prominent fleshy pink skin at the gape. The eye is red-brown, and the legs and feet pink with black soles.</p>\n<p>Voice: adult macaroni penguins make loud, raucous trumpeting calls, especially when establishing pair bonds and territories.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the royal penguin is identical apart from the white or pale grey face. It is unknown whether occasional dark-faced birds among royal penguin colonies are colour variants or vagrant macaroni penguins. The erect-crested penguin is almost as large, and also has a black face and long, robust orange bill, but has paired crests that do not meet on the forehead.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Macaroni penguins are an abundant breeding species on islands situated close to the Antarctic convergence (Polar Front) in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean. South Atlantic breeding sites include South Georgia, and South Sandwich and South Orkney Islands, with populations in the Falkland Islands and southern Chile also. In the Indian Ocean sector macaroni penguins breed on Crozet, Kerguelen, Marion, Prince Edward, Heard and McDonald Islands. There are no populations in the Pacific sector, where the macaroni penguin is replaced by the closely related royal penguin, and further north by the erect-crested penguin (the next largest crested penguin).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population of macaroni penguins is estimated at just under 9 million pairs. The largest populations are on South Georgia (c.2.5 million pairs, formerly 5.5 million pairs), Crozet (2.4 &#x2013; 3.9 million pairs), Kerguelen (c.1.8 million pairs), Heard Island (c.1 million pairs) and McDonald Island (c.1 million pairs). These numbers may seem large, but the species is in decline and is classified by the IUCN as vulnerable.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Within the New Zealand region, macaroni penguins have been recorded only on Campbell Island (December 1967 - January 1968, January 1993) and Snares Islands (January 1969, January 1970, November 1974, March 2015).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Although there are still very large populations of macaroni penguins, significant declines have been recorded at some of the large breeding sites such as South Georgia and Isla Recalada in southern Chile. Decline has also been observed at the World Heritage Sites of Heard and McDonald Islands. The reasons for the decline is unknown but possible suspects are climate change, impacts of industrial fishing for finfish and krill and shifting distribution and abundance in prey species.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The macaroni penguin is a social nester, congregating in very large breeding colonies. Territories are established by males in late October just before females arrive. Courtship is intense with the birds displaying mutual head movements, vocalisation and preening. Usually two eggs are laid but the smaller first egg is rejected when the larger second egg is laid. The majority of the care of the chick at the nest is done by the male. The chicks fledge in February to early March, then the adults moult in April-May, after which birds return to sea until October.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Apart from coming ashore for breeding and moulting, the macaroni penguin spends the rest of its life at sea. Predators at sea include leopard seals, fur seals and orca. Skuas and giant petrels take some eggs and chicks.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of the macaroni penguin consists of krill, fish and squid. During breeding, the female does most of the foraging until the end of the guard stage, provisioning the chick approximately every two days. Both adults feed the chick for the last 6-7 weeks before it goes to sea. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins range over long distances foraging for food. They have been recorded diving up to 100 metres depth, but most dives are much shallower..</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3857\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3857</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Baker, A.J.; Pereira, S.L.; Haddrath, O.P.; Edge, K.A. 2006.

They are easily recognised by their white faces, massive orange bills, and scruffy orange-yellow crests that meet on the forehead. Royal penguins are rare vagrants to New Zealand, but have occurred as far north as Napier.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Royal penguins are large crested penguins, approaching the size of yellow-eyed or gentoo penguins. They differ from all other crested penguins in that most birds have white faces (sometimes pale grey or dark gray). They are closely related to the (dark-faced) macaroni penguin, and share their enormous orange bill, prominent pink skin at the bill base, and scruffy orange-yellow crests that meet on the forehead. This last character is contra all other crested penguins, which have two separate crests that do not meet on the forehead. The remaining upperparts are blue-black, and the underparts silky white. Immature birds have a less robust, darker bill and reduced crest, but always have some chrome yellow feathers on the forehead.</p>\n<p>Voice: like other crested penguins, very noisy at colonies. The main call is a deep, throbbing bray or trumpeting. The contact call is a short bark.</p>\n<p>Similar species: macaroni penguin is almost identical apart from its dark face, though bill measurements average smaller than royal penguin. Chinstrap penguin is the only other white-faced penguin, but has no crest.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Like most penguins, royal penguins only come to land when required to breed or moult. They breed at Macquarie Island only, and are rarely recorded on land away from there. Colonies on Macquarie Island are situated on the coast and on slopes up to 200 m</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population of royal penguins is estimated at around 1,600,000 birds, with the 57 colonies ranging in size from 60 to more than 160,000 pairs. Vagrant birds are occasionally recorded on New Zealand subantarctic islands, the New Zealand mainland (mainly Otago), Tasmania, South Australia, the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica, and South Georgia.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Four North Island records: Napier (1880-81), Lyall Bay, Wellington (June 1926), Cape Palliser (February 2007) and Tora, Wairarapa (February 2013). South Island records include Brighton, Dunedin (March 1877), Waikouaiti (March 1877), Taiaroa Head (before 1927), Otago Peninsula (1938), Dunedin (March 1976), Moeraki (March 1986), Colac Bay, Souhland (February 1997), north of Kaikoura (March 1997), Nugget Point (February 2004), Hampden Beach (February 2006). There are three records from Chatham Islands (February 2005, March 2006, March 2009),&#xA0;three from Snares Islands (February 1986, March 1994, March 2015), one from Antipodes Island (March 2009), and at least 4 records from Campbell Island, including 4 birds in January 1968.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Being confined to a single breeding site, royal penguins are vulnerable to single-site catastrophes such as oil-spills. The population is considered stable at about 850,000 pairs in 57 colonies.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Royal penguins breed only on Macquarie Island in large colonies. They arrive in September and lay in October-November. Like all crested penguins, they lay two eggs of markedly different size, with a second larger egg laid about 4 days after the first. As with the two other large crested penguins (macaroni and erect-crested penguins), the egg size dimorphism is extreme, and almost all the small first eggs are lost early in incubation. Only in about 1% of nests does the first egg produce a chick. The five smaller species of crested penguins have less difference in the size of the two eggs, and generally hatch both eggs, with the chick from the smaller egg usually dying of starvation within 10 days. Incubation by royal penguins is shared and takes about 35 days. Both adults feed the chick, with most chicks fledging in late January, when about 65 days old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Like most penguins, royal penguins spend most of their lives at sea, coming ashore only to breed and moult. Both during breeding and feeding they are highly social. During the breeding season, foraging trips extend out to 415 km for females and 650 km for males, with durations varying from about 19 days during incubation, down to 5-6 days during chick-rearing. After chicks fledge, adults go to sea for about 36 days, after which they return to their breeding site to moult during February-March, which takes about 4 weeks. Once back at sea after the moult they travel vast distances, up to 10,000 km. The main predators of royal penguins are leopard seals, fur seals and sometimes orcas. Predation rates in the colonies are relatively low, with some unguarded chicks and eggs taken by subantarctic skuas (eggs and chicks), southern black backed gulls (eggs only) and giant petrels (chicks only).</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Royal penguins feed predominantly on Antarctic krill (<em>Euphausia superba</em>), which make up about 90% of the diet during the breeding season. At other times, fish can make up to 30% of the diet.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Penguin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Penguin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.photovolcanica.com/PenguinSpecies/Royal/RoyalPenguinPhotos.html\">http://www.photovolcanica.com/PenguinSpecies/Royal/RoyalPenguinPhotos.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bost, C.A.; Thiebot, J.B.; Pinaud, D,; Cherel, Y.; Trathan, P.N. 2009.

Recent research has revealed the presence on the South Island of a sister species, the Waitaha penguin <em>Megadyptes waitaha</em>. Up until c.1500 AD, yellow-eyed penguins were restricted to Auckland and Campbell Islands, while the mainland was occupied by Waitaha penguins<em>. </em>It is thought that Waitaha penguins were harvested to extinction, their disappearance enabling straggler yellow-eyed penguins from the subantarctic to establish on the mainland, where human-induced extirpation of large marine mammals allowed them to expand into the population we see today. The endemic yellow-eyed penguin is now the only extant member of the genus <em>Megadyptes</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The yellow-eyed penguin is a tall, heavy penguin with a distinctive pale yellow uncrested band of feathers passing across the nape and around the eyes. The forecrown, chin and cheeks are black flecked with yellow, the sides of the head and the foreneck are a light fawn-brown, and the back and tail are slate blue. The chest, belly, front thighs, and the underside of the flippers, are white. The red-brown and pale cream bill is long and relatively slender. The eyes are yellow, and the feet pink dorsally and black-brown ventrally. Juveniles lack the pale yellow band and have a paler eye and paler back of the head. Sexes look alike; males are larger than females.</p>\n<p>Voice: mostly silent, but at nest site gives a loud bray, similar to crested penguins but higher pitched and more tremulous.</p>\n<p>There are no similar species; the distribution, and the size, and particularly the colouration of adults is unmistakable, even in moult.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>Yellow-eyed penguins breed on the southeast coast of the South Island, on Stewart Island and adjacent islands, and in the subantarctic on the Auckland and Campbell Islands. On the mainland, yellow-eyed penguins breed in four distinct breeding regions: the Catlins, Otago Peninsula, North Otago and Banks Peninsula. The few pairs on Banks Peninsula usually breed with little success, and recruitment appears to come from more successful breeding areas further south. On Stewart Island, yellow-eyed penguins breed along the northeastern and eastern shores, and on several offshore islands. Vagrants have reached the North Island as far north as the Bay of Plenty, Chatham Islands and Snares Islands.</p>\n<p>The subantarctic and mainland New Zealand populations are genetically distinct.</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The present-day distribution of yellow-eyed penguin breeding sites corresponds to the pre-European distribution of cool coastal hardwood forest. Currently, breeding occurs in mature coastal forest, regenerating coastal scrub, but also in pasture, windbreaks of planted exotic trees, and on relatively exposed cliffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are estimated to be around 1,700 breeding pairs of yellow-eyed penguins, with the majority of these in the subantarctic on the Auckland and Campbell Islands. The South Island holds more than 600 pairs, while there are at least 180 pairs on and around Rakiura/Stewart Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"ColorfulList-Accent11\">On land, loss and fragmentation of habitat reduces reproductive success through predation, disease, human disturbance, heat stress and hypothermia. Predation of chicks by a suite of introduced mammalian predators, including feral cats, ferrets and stoats is one of the most significant impacts on yellow-eyed penguins. Adult penguins are not at risk from exotic terrestrial predators, except for dogs.</p>\n<p>Sharks, barracouta, fur seals and New Zealand sea lions take yellow-eyed penguins at sea. Yellow-eyed penguin adults and chicks periodically succumb to disease. There was a major die-off of adults in 1990, and in more recent breeding seasons young chicks in mainland breeding sites have become infected with a disease described as diphtheritic stomatitis.</p>\n<p>Yellow-eyed penguins are vulnerable to disturbance by humans, although carefully regulated tourist viewing of penguins and low-level intermittent intrusion by researchers does not carry measurable impact. However, unregulated and relatively high intensity disturbance by tourists is associated with reduced breeding success and lower chick weights at fledging, which results in lower first year survival and recruitment probabilities.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence that commercial or recreational fisheries directly reduce prey availability to yellow-eyed penguins, however they do occur as by-catch in inshore set nets. There can be marked inter-annual variation in food supply for yellow-eyed penguins, with intermittent poor food years being marked by reduced numbers of breeding attempts, slow chick growth, higher pre-fledging chick mortality, low chick fledging weights and lower survival of juveniles and adults.</p>\n<p>Habitat protection and restoration (including predator control) is managed by the Department of Conservation (DOC), the Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust, community groups, and private landowners.</p>\n<p>Commercial wildlife tourism takes place on both private land and on DOC-administered reserves. Unregulated visitor access is facilitated with signage and viewing hides. There is regulated seasonal tourist presence at yellow-eyed penguin landing and nesting areas on Enderby Island, in the Auckland Island group.</p>\n<p>Under DOC authority, privately funded rehabilitation centres serve as collection points for sick, injured or orphaned penguins. They also act as focal points for management responses to periodic disease outbreaks.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Yellow-eyed penguins select well-concealed nest sites under dense vegetation, with both sexes contributing to nest building. The nest is a shallow bowl of twigs, grass and leaves. Pairs may be seen together at nests sites as early as July-August. The mean lay date is 24 September on the Otago Peninsula but can occur later at more southern locations. A clutch of two eggs is laid 3-5 days apart. No replacement clutches are laid. Both sexes incubate the eggs, starting after the laying of the second egg, and so hatching (mainly in November) is synchronous. The incubation period ranges between 39 and 51 days, and is the most variable among penguins. Chick rearing has two phases: the guard phase when the chick is constantly brooded, and the post-guard phase when chicks are left alone at the nest during the day. Fledging takes place from February to sometimes as late as April.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Yellow-eyed penguins forage in the mid-shelf region between 2-25 km offshore, diving to depths of up to 40-120 m to obtain bottom-dwelling fish species such as sprat, red cod, opalfish, ahuru<em>,</em> silversides and blue cod, plus cephalopods and crustaceans.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p>Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust: <a href=\"http://yellow-eyedpenguin.org.nz/\">http://yellow-eyedpenguin.org.nz/</a></p>\n<p>Global Penguin Society: <a href=\"http://www.globalpenguinsociety.org/species.html\">http://www.globalpenguinsociety.org/species.html</a></p>\n<p>NZ Department of Conservation:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/penguins/yellow-eyed-penguin-hoiho/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/penguins/yellow-eyed-penguin-hoiho/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Boessenkool, S.; Austin, J.J.; Worthy, T.H.; Scofield, P.; Cooper, A.; Seddon, P.J.; Waters.

Northern and southern South Island populations of the Waitaha penguin were genetically distinct. Three individuals genetically related to <em>M. antipodes</em> found in pre-1500 AD samples have been interpreted as vagrants from the Auckland or Campbell Islands.

They are also the most common penguin found around all coasts of New Zealand&#x2019;s mainland and many of the surrounding islands. Primarily nocturnal on land, they are sometimes found close to human settlements and often nest under and around coastal buildings, keeping the owners awake at night with their noisy vocal displays. They live up to their scientific name &#x2018;<em>Eudyptula&#x2019;</em> meaning &#x201C;good little diver&#x201D;, as they are excellent pursuit hunters in shallow waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The little penguin is the smallest penguin. They are medium blue to dark indigo-blue dorsally, sometimes with a greenish cast, and have white underparts. Dark slate-blue on the face extends to just below the eye. Birds from Banks Peninsula and North Canterbury are the palest dorsally, have wider white margins on the front and back edges of the dorsal surface of their flippers, and may have more white on their face and rump. Before the annual moult, dorsal surfaces may be pale brown. The robust, hooked bill is dark grey, the iris blue-grey or hazel, and the legs and feet are off-white with dark soles. Males are slightly larger than females, with more robust bills. Recently fledged young are bright blue dorsally, and markedly smaller than adults.</p>\n<p>Voice: the main call at nesting sites is a loud bray ending in an inhalant squeal; also deep growls. A contact &#x2019;<em>bark</em>&#x2019; is given at sea.</p>\n<p>Similar species: recently-fledged crested penguins (e.g. Fiordland crested penguin) are also dark-blue dorsally, have dark bills, are much smaller than adults, and have reduced crests. All are at least half as large again as little penguin, and have at least a trace of yellow in front of or over the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Little penguins are widely distributed along the coastlines of the North, South, Stewart and Chatham Islands and their offshore islands. They visit (but are not known to breed at) the Three Kings Islands, and are vagrant to the Snares Islands. Little penguins are also common in south-western and south-eastern Australia, where they are also known as fairy penguin. Little penguins are mainly found within 25 km of the shore during the breeding season, but can travel further out to sea when not breeding. Major breeding areas in New Zealand include Hauraki Gulf islands, Wellington Harbour, Cook Strait islands and Marlborough Sounds, West Coast, Fiordland, Motunau Island, Banks Peninsula, Oamaru, Otago Peninsula, islands in Foveaux Strait and around Stewart Island, and the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Common along most New Zealand coastlines, especially where offshore islands provide protection from predators and disturbance, or where protection measures are in place on the mainland. The largest colonies are on Motunau Island (1650 nests) and at the Oamaru Blue Penguin colony (&gt;1,000 individuals).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Many colonies are in decline due to predation by introduced predators including cats, dogs and ferrets. Little penguins at sea are at risk of entanglement in set nets. Some mainland colonies are also affected by human encroachment onto important breeding areas, and individual pairs are often physically removed or blocked out of nest sites under houses, when owners object to their loud calls and fishy odour. Many adult penguins are hit and killed by cars where coastal roads run between breeding areas and the sea, e.g. around Wellington harbour and parts of north Westland. Little penguins respond well to predator control and provision of nest boxes to provide safe nesting sites, with populations around Wellington Harbour, Banks Peninsula and the Oamaru Blue Penguin Colony increasing as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Little penguins can breed as isolated pairs, in colonies, or semi-colonially. Nests are situated close to the sea in burrows excavated by the birds or other species, or in caves, rock crevices, under logs or in or under a variety of man-made structures including nest boxes, &#xA0;pipes, stacks of wood or timber, and buildings. They are monogamous within a breeding season, and share incubation and chick rearing duties. They are the only species of penguin capable of producing more than one clutch of eggs per breeding season, but few populations do so. The 1-2 white or lightly mottled brown eggs are laid from July to mid-November, and with rarer second (or even third) clutches beginning as late as December. Incubation takes up to 36 days. Chicks are brooded for 18-38 days, and fledge after 7-8 weeks. Pairs are often highly faithful to nest sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Little penguins are nocturnal on land. They return to nesting areas at dusk, congregating in small groups, or &#x201C;rafts&#x201D; offshore. Rafts usually come ashore together and are comprised of the same individuals each night. They feed at sea as solitary individuals or small groups, rarely more than 6 individuals. They must stay ashore continuously for about 2 weeks during the annual moult (mainly between January and March), when all feathers are replaced simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>During the breeding season little penguins forage within 20 km of the colony, pursuit diving for prey generally in waters less than 50 m deep. Their diet is composed of varying proportions of small shoaling fish, squid and crustacean species. Important prey items include arrow squid (<em>Nototodarus sloanii</em>), slender sprat (<em>Sprattus antipodum</em>), Graham&#x2019;s gudgeon (<em>Grahamichthys radiata</em>), red cod (<em>Pseudophycis bachus</em>), ahuru (<em>Auchenoceros punctatus</em>) and stomatopod larvae.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Penguin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Penguin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.penguins.co.nz/\">http://www.penguins.co.nz/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Challies, C.N. 1998.

Together, these are the largest of the great albatrosses, of which four species occur in New Zealand waters. The wandering albatross is most similar to the slightly smaller and darker Antipodean albatross, and the two are often lumped together as one species under the wandering albatross name. Here we use wandering albatross to refer only to the larger form that does not breed in the New Zealand region (other than a few pairs on Macquarie Island).</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Great albatrosses have an impressive wingspan and slow gliding flight, which distinguishes them from other smaller groups (e.g. gulls and mollymawks). They are normally found offshore, but can be seen in southern New Zealand waters and northwards to Cook Strait, and in lower numbers further north. Care is needed to separate wandering and Antipodean albatrosses, as their plumage markings overlap almost completely. The most reliable distinguishing characteristics are the larger size, and especially the larger bill of the true wanderer.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The adult wandering albatross is a very large white bird with variable amounts of black on the enormous (3 m wingspan) wings and a pinkish-salmon coloured bill. Some adults have a pinkish stain behind the ears. The wandering albatross has numerous, graduated plumage phases, from chocolate brown juveniles with white faces and underwings through to mature males that are pure white apart from their black wing tips and trailing edge to the wing. At close range, even the whitest birds usually have fine dark vermiculations on their body feathers (not present in the royal albatrosses). Most wandering albatrosses (and Antipodean albatrosses) have upper wings that are either completely dark or have a large white patch in the centre of the inner wing that expands as the bird gets older. All but the whitest colour variations of wandering albatross are also seen in the Antipodean albatross, which is slightly smaller with a smaller bill, most apparent if the birds settle on the water together. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Voice: wandering albatrosses are mainly silent at sea. At breeding grounds they give a high-pitched trumpeting call, and also groans, rattles, and &#x2018;puck&#x2019; sounds.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Similar species: the two royal albatross species are bulkier birds with a hunch-backed look in flight, and a fine dark cutting edge to the upper mandible (this can be difficult to see in flying birds). Royal albatrosses are much whiter birds, and (except for juvenile northern royal albatrosses) rarely have dark feathers anywhere other than the upperwings, which tend to whiten from the leading edge back, looking like the bird has flown through a bag of flour (cf. wandering and Antipodean albatrosses whitening from the centre of the wing outwards). Antipodean albatrosses (including Gibson&#x2019;s albatross) never get as white as the whitest wandering albatrosses, and usually have at least a dark skull cap. Other than mature &#x2018;snowy&#x2019; male wandering albatrosses, the two species can only be separated by size, with Antipodean albatross smaller with a shorter and less robust bill. Extra-limital Tristan albatross and Amsterdam albatross have the same plumage states as Antipodean albatross, though Amsterdam albatross has a dark cutting edge to the upper mandible.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Wandering albatrosses breed on South Georgia and on Crozet, Kerguelen, Marion, Prince Edward, Heard and Macquarie Islands, and range throughout the Southern Ocean in latitudes from Antarctic to subtropical waters. Non-breeding birds from the Crozet Islands (and to a lesser extent other populations) frequent New Zealand waters. Non-breeding birds from the Crozet Islands (breeders in their sabbatical year, and pre-breeding birds) may spend extensive periods in the deep waters in both the Tasman Sea and the eastern waters of New Zealand from the subantarctic to latitudes around East Cape. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Wandering albatrosses breed outside of the New Zealand region, in the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans and at Macquarie Island south-west of New Zealand. A global population of c. 8050 breeds biannually. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Threats to wandering albatrosses at breeding sites are few, as they breed mainly on sites with few or no predators. Threats in the marine environment consist principally of fisheries interactions, with population decreases linked to fishing mortality, particularly in longline fisheries. Recent studies have shown strong life-history consequences of inter-decadal changes in wind patterns, with stronger winds in the southern latitudes leading to reduced effort required for foraging by breeding birds, and positive population consequences. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Breeding occurs only outside of New Zealand and begins in the Austral spring, continuing for 8-10 months, depending on the site. Wandering albatrosses breed as monogamous pairs no more than once every two years, and have long-term pair bonds. The single large egg is laid in December or early January and is incubated by the parents in alternating shifts for about 11 weeks, with most hatching in March. The chick takes another 7-9 months to fledge; as the full breeding cycle takes 10-12 months, the adults then take a sabbatical year to complete their moult before attempting to breed again.

They breed almost exclusively on the Auckland and Antipodes Islands and forage over the continental shelf edge and deep water from south of West Australia to the coast of Chile, but are most common in the Tasman Sea and over the Chatham Rise east of New Zealand. Since 2003 a few pairs have started breeding on the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antipodean albatrosses are closely related to the wandering, Tristan and Amsterdam albatrosses, and more distantly related to the northern and southern royal albatrosses.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Antipodean albatrosses are large albatrosses with pink bills and plumage ranging in colour from brown with black upper wings, white face and underwing&#xA0; to predominantly white birds with black only on the outer 2/3 of the upper wings. The Auckland Island subspecies is lighter-coloured than the Antipodes Island subspecies, males are lighter-coloured than females and birds get lighter-coloured as they age. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice: courting birds perform elaborate dances and sequences of calls including screams, roars and bill clapping. Chicks make squeaky begging calls and squeals when practicing flying, and birds competing for food at sea bill clap and make a smaller range of clearly aggressive guttural calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: easily confused with wandering albatrosses which are larger, with more massive bills, and most often but not always lighter coloured. Also southern and northern royal albatrosses which are whiter-plumaged and have a black cutting edge to the upper mandible.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Auckland Island subspecies (<em>D.a. gibsoni</em>) breeds only in the Auckland Islands group, with most (95%) of birds nesting on Adams Island and the rest on Disappointment and the main Auckland Island. It forages over the shelf edge and deep waters mainly in the Tasman Sea but ranges from 115&#xB0; E in the west and 160&#xB0; W in the east and from 30&#xB0; S - 55&#xB0; S in the north and south. The Antipodes Island subspecies (<em>D. a. antipodensis</em>) breeds almost entirely on Antipodes Island though a few pairs nest on Campbell Island and three pairs on Chatham and Pitt Islands in the Chatham Islands. It mainly forages over the shelf edge and deep water around the Chatham Rise, but it ranges as far east as South America and a few birds visit the Tasman Sea and the great Australian Bight. It forages as far north as 27&#xB0;S, and as far south as 72&#xB0;S. &#xA0;Antipodean albatrosses come close to shore only at its breeding islands and where deep water occurs close to land , e.g., off Kaikoura. They follow boats and take discards and bait from hooks.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>About 3200 pairs breed each year on the Auckland Islands and about 3700 on Antipodes Island. Since successful breeders only nest every second year the total population of breeding birds is about twice as large.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>On the main Auckland Island pigs may take albatross chicks, but on other breeding islands (except Chatham and Pitt Islands, plus mice on Antipodes Island) there are no exotic predators. At sea their habit of following boats and taking bait from hooks has led to large numbers being killed in long-line fisheries, particularly the southern bluefin tuna fishery. During the 1970s and 1980s this probably led to a dramatic decline in numbers which slowed with the demise of the southern bluefin tuna fishery and improvements in bird bycatch avoidance techniques. Between 2005 and 2007 populations and breeding success at both the Auckland and Antipodes Islands dramatically declined - possible explanations for this decline include bycatch in a new swordfish fishery, but perhaps more likely are changing ocean conditions associated with global warming leading to reduced prey abundance. The conservation status of this species was moved from naturally uncommon to nationally critical in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Antipodean albatrosses lay a single egg between December and February and take a whole year to hatch the egg and raise the chick. Because of the long incubation and nestling period they can only raise a chick once every two years. The nest is a low pedestal built of soil and vegetation and sometimes lined with grass. Both members of the pair incubate the eggs and care for the young, taking shifts of up to 3 weeks while incubating.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Antipodean albatrosses, like all great albatrosses, are masters of low-energy flying, exploiting small updrafts created by wind and waves and rarely flapping their wings. &#xA0;They cover large distances at high speed to find sparsely distributed prey and their principle foraging areas are at latitudes between 35 and 45&#xB0;S. &#xA0;They can only nest in predator-free, windy, treeless places, which necessitates them nesting at some distance from their main feeding grounds. Their squid and fish diet is mostly scavenged, either taken from the surface or from shallow plunge dives. They are attracted to boats in the hope of getting discards. They don&#x2019;t start breeding till they are 7 to perhaps 20 years old and have an elaborate courtship lasting several years which initially involves a characteristic singing and dancing display. They form enduring pairs that mostly last until one or other dies. They are long-lived.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Antipodean albatrosses eat squid, fish and discards from boats.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodean_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodean_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30004\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30004</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/antipodean-albatross/diomedea-antipodensis/\">http://www.arkive.org/antipodean-albatross/diomedea-antipodensis/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/289-antipodean-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/289-antipodean-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels. 2009.

Endemic to New Zealand, the majority of the southern royal breeding population is found on subantarctic Campbell Island, with smaller numbers on the Auckland Islands. Birds breed biennially as it takes nearly a year to rear the single chick. Non-breeding birds and juveniles cross the Southern Ocean to feed in South American waters before returning to the breeding areas by circumnavigating the globe. Young birds begin returning to the islands at 3-4 years of age to find mates, and generally start breeding at 6-12 years, and live into their 40s. Southern royals are closely related to the northern royal albatross, which breeds at Taiaroa Head and the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The southern royal albatross is the largest of the albatrosses, rivalled only by the true wandering albatross. It has a white body and black wings and white tail. The leading edge of the inner upper wing becomes whiter with age, especially in males. The robust bill is light pink with a creamy tip and with a black cutting edge to the upper mandible. Juveniles have blacker wings than adults and white bodies with black flecking on the back, flanks, crown and tail.</p>\n<p>Voice: the &#x2018;sky-call&#x2019;, a high-pitched screaming bray, is given during displays by socializing birds (courting birds, breeders and gatherings of immature birds known as &#x2018;gams&#x2019;). Displays may culminate in yapping or clucking.</p>\n<p>Similar species: northern royal albatrosses have a solid black upper wing, and a dark fore-carpal on the underwing also is distinctive. Juvenile northern royal albatrosses have a greater amount of black flecking dorsally. Wandering albatrosses (<em>D. exulans</em>) have a pinker bill and no black cutting edge. The wings of wandering albatrosses also whiten with age, but from the centre of the wing, rather than the leading edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Over 99% of the southern royal albatross population breeds on Campbell Island, and a small proportion on the Auckland Islands (Enderby, Adams and Auckland), with a few birds apparently hybridising with northern royal albatrosses at Taiaroa Head. On Campbell Island, nests are scattered amongst tussock grasslands and megaherb fields at mid-elevation (180-350 m). Birds forage over the continental shelf and inner slope of southern New Zealand and the Campbell plateau, southern Chile, Uruguay and Argentina where they scavenge for squid and fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Approximately 8500 pairs of southern royal albatross breed each year on Campbell Island and &lt;100 pairs on the Auckland Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Southern royal albatrosses on Enderby Island were extirpated by humans in the 1800s and on Campbell Island the population was severely depleted during the sheep farming era (1890-1931) by burning of vegetation, grazing, degradation of nesting habitat and direct predation of birds by people, and probably farm dogs. Once the islands were protected in the 1950s-60s, introduced mammals were gradually removed from the islands. The population recovered during the second half of the 20th Century but appears to have levelled off during the early 2000s. Southern royal albatrosses are vulnerable to fisheries bycatch in New Zealand and South American waters, as well as in transit between these areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Southern royal albatrosses are monogamous, with long-term partnerships, although a small proportion divorce. Birds mature at 6-12 years of age. The breeding pattern is biennial, and successful breeders take one year off between breeding attempts. A single egg is laid in November-December, chicks hatch in February and fledge in October. Both adults of a pair share incubation and rearing. Nests on Campbell Island are dispersed at 3.1 nests/ha, although occasionally they are only a few metres apart.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Southern royal albatrosses are generally solitary at sea. Young birds gather to display in gams on the breeding grounds. A variety of postures and calls are used in agonistic and sexual displays, including aggressive bill snapping, clapping and gulping. Gamming and pair displays include: sky-calling with wings outstretched and head and neck stretched upward, croaking, yapping, billing, head shaking and whining. Partners mutual preen at the nest.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Southern royal albatrosses scavenge post-spawning cephalopods (squid and pelagic octopuses), fish, crustaceans and salps. Food is mostly seized from the water&#x2019;s surface, or by shallow plunges beneath the surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Royal_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Royal_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/albatrosses/royal-albatross-toroa/facts/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/albatrosses/royal-albatross-toroa/facts/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/offshore-islands/new-zealands-subantarctic-islands/campbell-island/monitoring-southern-royal-albatross-on-campbell-island/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/offshore-islands/new-zealands-subantarctic-islands/campbell-island/monitoring-southern-royal-albatross-on-campbell-island/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/southern-royal-albatross/diomedea-epomophora/\">http://www.arkive.org/southern-royal-albatross/diomedea-epomophora/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3954\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3954</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fs.fish.govt.nz/Page.aspx?pk=37&amp;dk=4&amp;sc=XRA\">http://fs.fish.govt.nz/Page.aspx?pk=37&amp;dk=4&amp;sc=XRA</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/300-southern-royal-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/300-southern-royal-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Moore, P.J.; Bettany, S.M. 2005.

It usually mates for life and breeds only in New Zealand. Biennial breeding takes place primarily on The Sisters and The Forty-Fours Islands in the Chatham Islands. There is also a tiny colony at Taiaroa Head near Dunedin on the mainland of New Zealand, which is a major tourist attraction.</p>\n<p>Northern royal albatross can be sighted throughout the Southern Ocean at any time of the year. Non-breeding and immature birds, including newly fledged birds, undertake a downwind circumnavigation in the Southern Ocean. The main wintering grounds are off the coasts of southern South America. They are generally solitary foragers and forage predominantly over continental shelves to shelf edges.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The northern royal albatross has a white body including the mantle, unlike smaller albatrosses referred to as mollymawks (which have dark backs). The head is white though a small number of females may show some black speckling on the crown. The wings are long and narrow with black upperwings and white underwings apart from a black leading edge between the carpal joint and wingtip. The white tail feathers are occasionally tipped in black. The heavily hooked bill is pale pink with a black cutting edge on the upper mandible. The legs and large webbed feet are a flesh colour. The bill and tarsus are darker pink when rearing chicks. Males are somewhat larger than females.</p>\n<p>Voice: northern royal albatrosses are usually silent at sea, but they may produce some croaking and gurgling sound when feeding around vessels.</p>\n<p>Similar species: southern royal albatross adults have at least some white on the upperwings (if not predominantly so). Juvenile southern royal albatrosses have black upperwings, but differ from northern royal albatross in having a white leading edge to the upperwing, and the absence of black on the leading edge of the underwing between the carpal joint and wingtip. Wandering and Antipodean albatrosses lack the black cutting edge to the upper mandible, and rarely exhibit an all-white head, body, and tail in combination with completely dark upperwings.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>When not breeding, northern royal albatrosses range widely throughout the Southern Ocean, though rarely into Antarctic waters. The breeding range is restricted to the Chatham Islands (Forty-Fours, Big and Little Sister Islands) and Taiaroa Head on the Otago Peninsula. Hybridisation with southern royal albatross on Enderby Island, Auckland Islands (and at Taiaroa Head) has been recorded. While breeding, they generally forage over the Chatham Rise, and are less common farther north than East Cape, North Island. The majority of the population spends their non-breeding period off both coasts of southern South America, especially over the continental shelf and slope off Chile, and the Patagonian shelf off Argentina.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total breeding population in the Chatham Islands colonies (99% of the total) is estimated at c. 6,500-7,000 pairs, with c. 5,200-5,800 pairs breeding each year. This number roughly equates to a total population of 17,000 mature individuals. Nearly 30 pairs breed each year at Taiaroa Head which supports 1% of the population. Although the Taiaroa Head colony is increasing, the trend for the overall population remains unknown due to the lack of recent data from the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Habitat change on the breeding colonies due to storms and climatic changes could be the present major threat to the species. Breeding success in the Chatham Island colonies reduced significantly as a result of a large storm in 1985 that caused loss of soil and vegetation. Since the mid-1970s, both the Chatham Islands and Taiaroa Head colonies have experienced warming and drying of habitat. More recently, the Taiaroa Head colony has been subject to egg and chick failure due to heat stress and infestation by an introduced blowfly. Historically, the birds were harvested in the Chatham Islands by local residents, and this may still occur occasionally. There are no introduced mammals on the small islands where northern royal albatrosses breed within the Chatham Islands. At Taiaroa Head, vandalism of nests and eggs occurred before 1937, and predation of chicks by introduced mammals was recorded in some years. Fishery-related mortality is not considered a significant issue, although a few birds have been reported killed.</p>\n<p>The populations on the Chatham Islands have been monitored mainly by means of aerial photographs. Monitoring of the Taiaroa Head population has been undertaken since 1937. Introduced mammalian predators have been intensively controlled at and in the vicinity of Taiaroa Head. A sprinkler system has been installed at Taiaroa Head to cool nesting birds on particularly hot days. Also, an incubator and a fly repellent have been used to reduce the risk of blow fly infestation.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Northern royal albatrosses have long-term monogamous pair-bonds, with shared incubation and chick-rearing duties. They nest in colonies and breed biennially if successful in rearing a chick. A breeding cycle takes almost a whole year to complete, with the single egg laid in late October to late November. Hatching takes place between late January and early February after about 79 days of incubation. The chick is brooded for c.34 days and then guarded for 6 more days. Chicks fledge at the age of about 240 days in September. Juvenile birds return to colonies when 3-4 years old. The average age of first breeding is 8 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Normally known as solitary foragers, northern royal albatrosses may congregate at food sources at sea. Unlike other albatrosses, they are not a keen vessel follower. They are surface feeders and scavengers. Most of their food is thought to be obtained by seizing dead or dying prey from the surface and also by scavenging discards and offal from fishing boats. They can dip the head and neck to one metre depth. When breeding, birds forage over the continental shelves to shelf edges in New Zealand waters. Non-breeding and young birds can be found anywhere in the Southern Ocean throughout the year, with the main wintering areas off the coasts of southern South America.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Northern royal albatrosses mainly feed on squid and other cephalopods, along with fish, crustaceans, and salps. One interesting fact is that about one-third of the cephalopods eaten by albatrosses at Taiaroa Head are bottom-dwelling octopuses &#x2013; presumably after they are discarded following their capture in crayfish pots and other benthic fishing equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Royal_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Royal_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30005\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30005</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/albatrosses/royal-albatross-toroa/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/albatrosses/royal-albatross-toroa/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/296-northern-royal-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/296-northern-royal-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Imber, M.J. 1999.

They have recently been introduced to Mana, Motuara and Blumine Islands, in the Cook Strait region. Before human settlement of New Zealand&#xA0;rowi were widespread throughout the northern South Island and into the southern North Island, as far north as Lake Poukawa (Hawkes Bay). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There were about 375&#xA0;rowi in 2012. The only breeding population is at Okarito; island populations are either used as cr&#xE8;ches or have been established only recently. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rowi&#xA0;disappeared from most of their range in the southern North Island and northern South Island. Since European settlement have been known only from the Okarito area, in roughly the same range as occupied now. Up until the 1990s, they were declining due to recruitment failure caused by predation of chicks and juveniles by stoats, and some adults being killed by dogs and motor vehicles. In 1995, their population was estimated at 160 birds. &apos;Operation Nest Egg&apos; (the removal of eggs or young chicks from the wild and the rearing of chicks and juveniles in captivity and on Motuara Island, until large enough (1.2 kg) to cope with the presence of stoats), allowed the populations to increase to about 200 birds by 2000. A landscape-scale stoat trapping programme in South Okarito Forest from 2001 to 2005 largely failed to protect chicks from stoat predation. Operation Nest Egg was therefore reinstated, and the population has grown rapidly to the 375 birds in 2012. New populations have been established on Mana and Blumine Islands, but birds have yet to breed at these sites. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rowi eggs are laid from July to January. The nest is in a burrow, hollow base of a tree, or in a hollow log. Clutch size is 1, but sometimes clutches can be overlapped with one freshly laid egg and one close to hatching.&#xA0; The pale-green egg is very large. Incubation is shared by male and female, with the male doing most incubation by day and duties are shared through the night. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rowi are flightless and nocturnal. During the day they rest in a burrow, hollow tree or log, or under thick vegetation and emerge shortly after nightfall. They feed by walking slowly along tapping the ground and when prey is detected they probe their bill into the leaf litter or a rotten log; occasionally plunge their bill deep into the ground. Rowi call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners; pairs often duet, with the partner responding a few seconds after the first call has been completed.&#xA0;They are territorial, and fight conspecifics with their sharp claws.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rowi eat mostly small invertebrates, especially earthworms and larvae of beetles, cicadas and moths; they also eat centipedes, spiders, crickets, weta and freshwater crayfish.

Fiordland tokoeka were introduced to Kapiti Island in 1908, where they have hybridised with North Island brown kiwi. Recently, Haast tokoeka have been introduced to Coal and Rarotoka Islands, and to the Orokonui Ecosanctuary, Dunedin, and small islands in Lakes Te Anau and Manapouri are used as cr&#xE8;che sites for this taxon. Before human settlement of New Zealand tokoeka were widespread throughout the southern and eastern part of the South Island as far north as North Canterbury.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 30,000 birds in 2012; Haast tokoeka, c. 350 birds; Fiordland tokoeka, c. 15,000 birds; Stewart Island tokoeka, c. 15,000 birds. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tokoeka disappeared from the eastern part of their range first, and within the last 50 years they have disappeared from northern and eastern fringes of Fiordland. Habitat loss, and predation by dogs and, more recently, by stoats, ferrets and cats have contributed to their decline. At Haast, the population was declining because of recruitment failure due to predation of chicks and juveniles by stoats, and some adults being killed by dogs. Since 2000, an extensive trapping programme and removal of eggs or young chicks from the wild and the rearing of chicks and juveniles in captivity and on predator-free islands until large enough (1.2 kg) to cope with the presence of stoats, has allowed the population to increase from c.300 birds to about 350 birds by 2012. New populations of Haast tokoeka have been established on Coal and Rarotoka Islands and at Orokonui Ecosanctuary, Dunedin. Landscape-scale stoat trapping in parts of Fiordland appear to be halting or reversing the overall population decline. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eggs are laid from June to December. The nest is in a burrow, rock crevice, hollow base of a tree, or in a hollow log. Clutch size is 1 very large, pale green egg.

By the time of European settlement they had virtually disappeared from the North Island, with only one specimen collected (Mt Hector, Tararua Range, 1875) and another reported from near Pirongia in 1882. Still common in Nelson, Westland and Fiordland through to the early 1900s, but gradually disappeared, leaving a small relict population on D&#x2019;Urville Island. It is believed that five little spotted kiwi were introduced to Kapiti Island from the Jackson Bay area in 1912, and they flourished on the island. Since 1983, birds have been transferred from Kapiti to establish new populations on Hen, Tiritiri Matangi, Motuihe, Red Mercury, Long (Marlborough Sounds),&#xA0;Chalky and Anchor Islands, and to Zealandia/Karori Sanctuary (Wellington). Two D&#x2019;Urville birds were transferred to Long Island (Marlborough Sounds). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 1650 birds in 2012. Kapiti Island is the stronghold for the species, with c.1200 birds; Zealandia 120; Tiritiri Matangi 80; Red Mercury Island 70; Hen Island 50; Long Island 50; Chalky Island 50; Motuihe 30. Twenty birds from Kapiti Island were translocated to&#xA0;Anchor Island (Fiordland) in April 2015.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little spotted kiwi died out in the North Island in the late 1800s, possibly as a result of predation by dogs. The decline and ultimate extinction in the South Island was probably the result of predation by mustelids, dogs and cats. Luckily, a few birds were introduced to Kapiti Island in 1912, where they flourished despite the presence of weka. Transfers to other pest-free sites have been largely successful. Little spotted kiwi have the lowest genetic diversity of the five kiwi species, which is not surprising given that the current population is foundered from a maximum of 7 birds, and most likely just 5 birds introduced to Kapiti Island. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eggs are laid from July to January. The nest is in a short burrow, hollow log, or on the ground under dense vegetation. Clutch size is 1 or 2 large white eggs.

During the day they rest in a burrow, rock crevice, hollow log, or under dense vegetation, and then emerge shortly after nightfall. They feed by walking slowly along tapping the ground and when prey is detected they probe their bill into the leaf litter or a rotten log, or pick prey up from the surface; only rarely plunge their bill deep into the ground. Little spotted kiwi call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners; often pairs will duet.

A new population has been established near Lake Rotoiti, Nelson Lakes National Park, and very sparse or recently extirpated populations in the Flora Valley (Arthur Range) and Nina Valley (near Lewis Pass) have been supplemented by recent releases. At the time of European settlement they had a similar distribution, except that the Paparoa Range and Southern Alps populations probably linked in the Grey Valley.

The very wet upland and subalpine areas they mainly occupy have lower densities of mammalian predators, and this may have allowed great spotted kiwi to remain locally common in some sites. Hourly call rates across the whole range is slowly declining, but landscape scale management of predators through periodic aerial 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) operations, or trapping, may have slowed or reversed the declines in some areas. The removal of eggs or young chicks from the wild and the rearing of chicks and juveniles in captivity or in predator-proof cr&#xE8;ches, until large enough (1.2 kg) to cope with the presence of stoats, has allowed some populations to increase. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eggs are laid from July to December.

Call occasionally each night to advertise territory and to maintain contact with partners; often duetting pairs will interrupt the call of their partner, so male and female calls are alternated.&#xA0; They are fiercely territorial, and fight conspecifics with their sharp claws, resulting in a cloud of feathers on the ground.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Great spotted kiwi eat mostly small invertebrates, especially earthworms and larvae of beetles and cicadas; they also eat centipedes, spiders, beetles, weta, snails and freshwater crayfish.

They are common in open shrublands throughout most of the country. The male has a striking black face bordered with white, and a conspicuous top-knot or plume. The female is duller in colour with a less obvious plume. The young are numerous and able to fly at a young age, but have a low survival rate. In autumn, quail gather in large coveys to feed and roost together. The male call, often represented as &#x2018;<em>Chi-ca-go</em>&#x2019;, is distinctive and diagnostic.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail are stocky, predominantly grey and brown, with a diagnostic forward-curling black plume rising erect from the top of their heads. Males have a black chin and cheeks edged with white, and separate white &#x2018;eyebrows&#x2019; join on the forehead. The breast is blue-grey and the lower belly cream to rust brown with distinctive black scalloping, which merges into strong, pale streaks on the dark brown flanks. The female is slightly smaller, duller and browner, with some streaking on the neck and a more subdued scalloping on the belly, but with equally bold streaking on the flanks. Immature birds are similar to the female but a lighter brown. The female&#x2019;s crest plume is much smaller than the male&#x2019;s. Both sexes have fine speckling on the nape, which is bolder in the male. There is no seasonal change in plumage. California quail have short, rounded wings and a relatively long tail. Their legs and bill are black and sturdy, with the bill being slightly hooked. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Foraging quail pace sedately, but when disturbed they run at speed, their feet a blur of movement, or burst into flight with noisy, rapid wingbeats. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Voice: the distinctive 3-note male crow is described in a variety of entertaining ways (&#x2018;Tobacco&#x2019;, &#x2018;McPherson&#x2019;, &#x2018;Chi-<strong>ca</strong>-go&#x2019; etc.). It is more accurately rendered as &#x2018;qua-quergo&#x2019;. The first note may be given by itself. The calling bird is usually perched slightly above the surrounding area, e.g on a log or post. Other calls include foraging grunts, sharp urgent tut-tut warnings and soft tup-tup sounds, possibly location guides. Chicks make a high whistle, alerting parents to their location</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Similar species: the brown quail is smaller and browner, with intricate patterning on the back, and lacks a head plume..</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail are native to western USA from Oregon to the Baja Peninsula. They have been introduced to most continents as game birds. The first release in New Zealand was at Papakura in 1862 with later releases in Nelson, Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury and Otago. They spread rapidly, and are now most numerous from Northland to the Waikato, inland Bay of Plenty, coastal Wairarapa, Nelson/Marlborough, North Canterbury and Banks Peninsula. They are uncommon or absent in&#xA0;Southland, the Southern Alps, the West Coast and the Chatham Islands. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The preferred habitat for California quail is uncultivated open shrubland. They frequent the rough scrubby edges of rivers, inlets, forests, roads and rural gardens. Examples of good quail habitat include bracken, tussock grass, matagouri, gorse, blackberry, tutu and lupin</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail are abundant throughout their range, though they have apparently declined compared to e.g. 1920s Canterbury, when coveys in excess of 100 birds were frequently recorded. It is now unusual to see more than 20 quail in a single covey.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Ecological and economic aspects</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail are not considered to have any conservation or economic impacts, but are hunted on a limited scale. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Breeding </strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Males are aggressive when courting, and often fight each other. Courtship displays include head dips, puffing up of contour feathers, and spreading of the tail feathers. Nests are a flattened grassy area well concealed among dense vegetation. The nest is often placed against a log or rock. The eggs hatch synchronously, partly achieved by the chicks calling to each other while still in the egg. The walnut-sized striped chicks leave the nest as soon as they are dry, and are extremely active, if somewhat uncoordinated as a group. Older chicks keep together in more coherent groups, attended by the parents. The chicks can fly at a surprisingly young age, when about a quarter of the size of the female.. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">In autumn, family groups gather into large coveys, roosting in low branches and separating into smaller groups to feed during the day. When disturbed at a distance, female California quail will crouch motionless, relying on their camouflaged colouration, while the more conspicuous male is more likely to alarm call and flee to a prominent perch. At closer range the covey will run off at speed, or explode into flight en masse, flying a short distance into dense cover. </p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">California quail consume seeds of many kinds, some fruit and leaves. They feed mainly early in the morning and late in the afternoon, spending more time foraging when food is scarce. The young are insectivorous initially.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Quail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Quail</a></p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/southland/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/quail/californian-quail/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/southland/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/quail/californian-quail/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"Body\">Fitter, J.; Merton, D. 2011.<em> A field guide to the birds of New Zealand. </em>Princeton University Press.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2000.<em> The field guide to the birds of New Zealand. </em>Viking, Auckland. </p>\n<p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

The scattered groups of birds found today probably all originated from birds that have wandered off from farmyards. The species has been domesticated for thousands of years, and probably all birds released locally come from domestic stock.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The helmeted guineafowl is a plump chicken-sized bird with a characteristic humped-back appearance. The slate grey plumage is speckled with numerous white spots, the neck is short and featherless, and the small bare head bears a scimitar-shaped bony casque. Skin on the lower face and upper neck is sky blue with red-tipped wattles and a darker blue throat flap. The cere, forehead and crown are red, the bill and casque are horn-coloured, and the iris brown. The lower neck is covered with brownish-grey down-like feathers that extend halfway up the back of the upper neck. Lower down these merge into normal slate-grey body feathers, each of which has a dozen or more uniformly spaced white spots, creating an overall speckled appearance. The flight feathers are similarly patterned, although the dots on the outer webs merge to form fine white stripes that align when the wing is closed, creating a barred appearance. Birds from domestic stock often have whitish facial skin, occasional white flight feathers, and irregular patches of white on the flanks and belly. The legs are dark grey in wild-type birds, and orange-brown in domestic birds; leg spurs absent. Females have shorter and narrower casques and smaller wattles, but are best distinguished by their distinctive, sex-specific call (see below).&#xAD;&#xAD;&#xAD; Young birds are similar to adults but have paler facial skin and less obvious white spots. Chicks are brownish-grey, with black fringes to the body and emerging flight feathers. Their head feathers are brown with longitudinal black stripes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: males give a single, recurring <em>chek</em> note; females produce a distinctive, repetitive two-syllable call <em>buck-wheat</em>, the first note short, second one longer and rising. In both sexes, the rate of repetition of their calls increases when birds become agitated or excited. The alarm call is a repeated, harsh, rattling <em>kek-kek-kek-kek-krrrrrrr</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: adult helmeted guineafowl may resemble adult female and immature wild turkeys and common pheasants but are distinguished by white-spotted grey plumage and a bony casque on the head.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the period 1999-2004, helmeted guineafowl were recorded from less than 1 per cent of the country, mostly around Auckland and farmland around Kaipara Harbour. Some earlier reported populations, such as around Aberfeldy, near Whanganui, no longer exist. Guineafowl do best in areas that have a mosaic of habitats. Populations tend to decline in areas of uniform grassland and pasture, especially where pesticides are commonly used. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The size of the current wild population is unknown but probably small. The history of failed introductions and small, short-lived populations suggest that this species cannot sustain itself naturally in New Zealand, at least under present conditions. There are a number of registered breeders in New Zealand, and an unknown number of owners of domestic guineafowl flocks, both of which can serve as sources of deliberate or inadvertent re-introductions. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Guineafowl can damage emerging seedlings of agricultural crops, but this is offset partly by the number of insects that they eat. Guineafowl are prime gamebirds in other parts of the world, but require careful management to prevent overharvesting.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Guineafowl breed in spring and summer, probably timed so that eggs hatch when arthropods and seeds are most abundant, towards late summer. At the start of the breeding season, a male associates successively with a number of females before pairing with one of them. The pair keep close together for the rest of the season, the male feeding his mate during courtship and guarding her during egg laying and incubation. The nest is a deep scrape lined with grass and detached feathers, placed beneath a bush or in dense cover. Females lay 6-12 cream-brown, pear-shaped eggs that she alone incubates. Larger clutches have been recorded elsewhere, but probably represent eggs laid by more than one female. The shells are noticeably thicker and stronger than those of domestic chickens. Eggs hatch after about 26 days, and the chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, feeding for themselves but copying their parents while following them closely. Both parents brood the young chicks initially. Chicks can fly weakly when 2-weeks old, and become fully fledged about 2 weeks later. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Helmeted guineafowl usually occur in small flocks of 6-20 birds, foraging by walking and pecking or scratching the ground like chickens, calling as they move. Males in flocks often chase each other around, perhaps consolidating their social hierarchy; outright fighting is rare. The birds generally stay close to cover when foraging. If disturbed, they tend to run rather than fly but, when necessary, they will burst from cover in steeply angled flight, giving jarring alarm calls <em>kekkekkekkek</em>. Guineafowl roost in trees at night. Birds gathering before going to roost are noisy, give a mix of <em>kek-kek</em> calls and a softer version of the <em>buck-wheat</em> call.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nothing is known of the diet of helmeted guineafowl in New Zealand. Elsewhere they are omnivorous, eating grass seeds, fruits, leaves, other vegetable matter, and invertebrates. They use their strong legs and toes to grub out bulbs, seedlings, beetles, bugs, and insect larvae; leaves, flower heads and fruits of herbaceous plants are plucked from growing plants. Small lizards, frogs and even small mice are pursued and dispatched with a sharp jab and flick of the bill. Occasionally, birds can be seen jumping a few centimetres off the ground to pluck food items just out of reach. </p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.guineafowlinternational.org/\">http://www.guineafowlinternational.org/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmeted_Guineafowl\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmeted_Guineafowl</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Elbin, S.B.; Crowe, T.M.; Graves, H.B. 1986.

California quail is smaller, has an erect crest, no barring on the flanks, and males have a black face.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chukor are found in the South Island high country from Marlborough to Otago. They inhabit dry hill country, open shrubland and tussock lands with rock outcrops east of the Southern Alps, up to 2,000 metres. Chukor are occasionally seen at lower altitudes in Marlborough (Cape Campbell).

Populations are widely scattered and fragmented, with many populations apparently in decline.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chukor are not recognised as having any conservation or economic impacts, beyond supporting a limited hunt. They are protected outside the May to August shooting season. It is likely that their numbers are mainly controlled by harsh weather, and predation by introduced mustelids (ferrets and stoats) and native birds of prey (swamp harrier and New Zealand falcon). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chukor form pairs in September, with the breeding season extending to January. The average clutch is 8 but clutches of up to 18 eggs being recorded. The nest is a simple scrape on the ground, hidden under the cover of tussocks or shrubs. Incubation is solely by the female and takes 3 weeks. The chicks leave the nest as soon as they are dry. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Young are cared for in family coveys accompanied by up to 10 adults.

The local Fish &amp; Game Council may know of releases occurring in other parts of the country. Birds are usually released into shooting preserves or on to rough farmland adjacent to areas of shrubland. As many released red-legged partridges are habituated to people, they can be quite approachable, and are often reported from gardens near release sites.</p>\n<p>The natural range of the red-legged partridge is south-western Europe. They have been introduced into many countries, including England, Scotland, Greece, Algeria and the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>A total of 2138 eggs from British suppliers was brought into New Zealand in 1980-81; of these 203 hatched. The first birds were released east of Huntly in March 1984, with over 13,000 released from North Auckland to Canterbury by 1990. The numerous birds held by game farms (in 2015) are all descended from these original birds, with releases continuing (particularly in South Auckland). Despite the thousands of birds released, and some wild breeding occurring, red-legged partridges are not recognised as having a self-sustaining wild population established in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Over $300,000 was spent on attempts to establish red-legged partridges in New Zealand up to 1990, with the largest contribution ($217,549) coming from the Auckland Acclimatisation Society.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Breeding has not been described in the wild in New Zealand, although any unbanded birds seen are likely to have hatched from eggs laid in the wild. In Europe, most clutches comprise 10-16 eggs, which are about 41 x 31 mm, off-white with reddish or grey markings. The nest is a shallow cup lined with plant material, hidden under or among vegetation. Females may lay two clutches, incubating one themselves and leaving the other for the cock to care for independently and simultaneously. Incubation takes 23-25 days, and the chicks leave the nest as soon as they are dry. </p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Young are cared for in family coveys.

It was the first bird species known to have become extinct following European colonisation. Previously, it was common throughout the North and South Islands,&#xA0;with M&#x101;ori exploiting it as a food source. There is little information available on its biology, apart from what can be determined from the few specimens held in museums. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand quail was most closely related to the Australian stubble quail <em>Coturnix pectoralis</em>, and was not particularly closely related to the brown quail introduced to New Zealand from 1871. Both the female and male had barred white-and-black markings over brown base feathers. The nape varied in colour from brown to rufous-brown in males. The underbody feathers were buff with varying amounts of black barring. The female was slightly larger than the male. Their eyes were light hazel, bill black, and legs and toes pale flesh brown. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand quail was widely distributed throughout the main islands of New Zealand, especially where there was grassland habitat. It was most abundant in the South Island, especially east of the Southern Alps. Its distribution expanded after the arrival of Maori, who burnt large areas of forest thus creating grassland. By the mid-1800s, it had become scarce in the North Island and decreased rapidly in Canterbury as the result of agricultural conversion of the grasslands, and hunting. It was presumed extinct by 1875. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand quail was primarily an open-country bird, with fossil evidence and early historical records indicating that its preferred habitat was grassland and shrubland. As with other <em>Coturnix</em> species, the New Zealand quail had very stout legs and a torpedo-shaped body with which to run through thick grass and undergrowth. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Both archaeological and European historical records indicate that the quail was widespread throughout New Zealand, apparently living in extended family coveys. Before the arrival of humans, quail coexisted with a wide range of potential avian predators. After Polynesian settlement, quail were subjected to hunting and potential predation by Pacific rats (kiore) and kuri (Polynesian dogs). New Zealand quail became extinct before ship rats, stoats and ferrets were widespread, but they were exposed to about 100 years of predation by Norway rats and feral cats, as well as vastly increased hunting pressure following the introduction of guns. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The nest of the New Zealand quail was a cup-shaped indentation of flattened grass that was well concealed. The striped barring of the back feathers of the incubating adult (most probably the hen) blended perfectly with the ground cover surrounding the nest. The timing of breeding and the length of the breeding season is unknown. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Early European hunters described the call of the New Zealand quail as &#x2018;<em>twit, twit, twit, twee-twit&#x2019;</em>. Buller stated that quail were very common, and that daily bags of 40 or more birds were not uncommon. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little is known about the diet of the New Zealand quail. It was apparently mainly herbivorous, feeding on seeds, flowers and foliage. The closely-related stubble quail in Australia also takes adult insects, caterpillars and small frogs, as well as seeds and foliage. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Quail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Quail</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Buller, W.L. 1888. <em>A history of the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Along with failed releases of other quail species from Australia at the same time, it is possible that these releases contributed to the extinction of the endemic New Zealand quail through the introduction of new diseases. Tiritiri Matangi Island and Shakespear and Tawharanui Regional Parks are the most accessible places in New Zealand where brown quail are reliably found.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail are small, inconspicuous grey-brown quail, with intricately patterned plumage. The sexes are similar, but the female is slightly larger, and there are subtle differences in their plumage. The male has a more pronounced russet or cream throat patch, and bolder white longitudinal streaks on its upper-wing feathers. The red-brown and dark brown chevron pattern on the flanks of the female are more prominent compared to the lighter colour of the male, and the chest feathers of the female are red-brown compared to grey-brown on the male. Eye colour varies from red to yellow and the legs are orange or yellow. Both sexes have black bills.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: the main call is a high pitched <em>&apos;ker-wee&apos;</em> with a rising inflexion.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: California quail are large, plainer grey-brown dorsally, and have an erect plume crest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although released throughout New Zealand, the range of brown quail retracted gradually northwards. It is now mainly confined to East Cape, the Coromandel Peninsula, North Auckland and Northland, plus Moutohora/Whale Island, several islands in the Hauraki Gulf and north to the Three Kings Islands, with scattered records south to the Manawatu. There are no records of quail being introduced to offshore islands, which indicates they are capable of flying considerable distances. Brown quail became common on Tiritiri Matangi Island and in Tawharanui and Shakespear Regional Parks following eradication of introduced predators.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail are cryptically coloured to blend with their preferred habitat of scrub and rough grassland. In both Australia and New Zealand, brown quail are frequently seen around wetland margins and on road verges.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The largest populations of brown quail are in the Far North and on introduced-predator free islands of the Hauraki Gulf and the Bay of Plenty. The population on 220 ha Tiritiri Matangi Island is estimated to be 200-300 birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail form breeding pairs in spring. Eggs are laid between July and January in a simple scrape in the ground or flattened grass, Nests are well hidden under dense vegetation, and both they and the&#xA0;incubating female are very difficult to detect. Once hatched, the precocial chicks gather in&#xA0;extended family group coveys. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail give a range of shrill, piercing calls that carry through thick undergrowth and are used to bring covey members together. Outside the breeding season, the family group breaks up and most quail are observed as pairs. Brown quail do not defend territories but do occupy a defined home range. In Australia, brown quail are nomadic, moving between suitable habitat for foraging and breeding. Brown quail often dust bathe in open dry sunny patches on the edges of shrubland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown quail glean from low foliage and forage in leaf litter for seeds, leaves, flowers and invertebrates. Analysis of faecal samples showed a high proportion of invertebrate parts. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Quail\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Quail</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/quail/brown-quail/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/quail/brown-quail/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=200\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=200</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australian Museum. 2005.

It was herbivorous and terrestrial, inhabiting grassland, scrublands or open forests and with little association with wetlands or lakes. It was stout, thick-legged and had become progressively flightless since its first colonisation from Australia. Finsch&#x2019;s duck was first described from a fossil deposit from the Earnscleugh Cave in central Otago.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Finsch&#x2019;s duck was similar in size to a mallard duck, with thick legs suitable for a terrestrial lifestyle, and reduced wings. It was flightless, or near so. The bill was short and stout;&#xA0;comparative measurements of the nasal cavity and orbit (eye socket) with closely related species suggest that it may have relied on its sense of smell, more than its eyesight.</p>\n<p>Of the few feathers found, most are silvery-greyish and most have vermiculations, but at least one is a more even grey with a black spot at each distal corner, very similar to the feathers on the breast of male Australian wood ducks (<em>Chenonetta jubata</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Finsch&#x2019;s duck was common and widespread throughout the eastern drylands of the North and South Islands, where rainfall was below 1200 mm. In the South Island, it was distributed from Marlborough to the shores of Foveaux Strait with a more patchy distribution in areas with wetter climates, where scattered population lived in upland or river flat grasslands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population, threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Because of its abundance, Finsch&#x2019;s duck is thought to have been an important dietary component of the two large extinct raptors: Haast&#x2019;s eagle and Eyles&#x2019; harrier, and possibly also of the extinct adzebills (<em>Aptornis</em>). It has been suggested that Finsch&#x2019;s duck became reduced in range and population before human settlement. Extinction occurred after Polynesian settlement but there is uncertainty whether they persisted into European times. An unconfirmed report from behind Opotiki during European times described a &#x201C;ruffus&#x201D; coloured bird which may have been a Finsch&#x2019;s duck. Finsch&#x2019;s duck was probably extremely vulnerable to egg predation by Pacific rats, and they were hunted by early Maori. Polynesian rats may have competed for food. While their grassland and dryland habitats were highly modified by burning following human settlement, there is uncertainty regarding whether Finsch&#x2019;s duck would have benefited from the subsequent changes to their grassland habitat.</p>\n<p>Abundant bone deposits of Finsch&apos;s duck have allowed analyses of changes in body proportions over time. These revealed&#xA0;a progressive reduction of wing length by 10% between the Late Glacial (12,000- 10,000 years ago) and the late Holocene (1800 years ago),&#xA0;associated with a reduced ability to fly.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>It is likely that Finsch&#x2019;s duck&#xA0;bred in hollows, tree trunk or fallen logs because these are the preferred breeding locations of the Australian wood duck, its nearest relative.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Finsch&#x2019;s duck was most likely a grazer and browser of vegetation, probably mixed with fallen fruit and some invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Holdaway, R.N. 1989.

All of New Zealand&#x2019;s birds are derived from domestic stock; the wild variety is not present in New Zealand in a captive or wild state.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Muscovy ducks are large, goose-like ducks with highly variable plumage. Most New Zealand birds are either plain white or pied. Pied birds have a green sheen on their dark feathers. Birds with grey and brown colouring may also be present. &#xA0;A small crest may be raised when birds are alarmed. The bill is either pink-and-blackish, or entirely pink, and the base is surrounded by bright red caruncles. They have relatively short legs, and are less mobile on land than other ducks. The legs and feet are partially or entirely pale orange in colour, and the toes have long, sharp claws. The male is much larger than the female, and can weigh over twice as much.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: Generally silent or quiet. The female makes a soft quacking sound; the male makes puffing and hissing noises.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Entirely white birds bear some resemblance to white domestic forms of mallards, and to male greylag geese, but are distinguishable by the red caruncles and body shape. Pied birds are unmistakable. Muscovy ducks can hybridise with mallards; hybrids are highly variable in plumage and have features of both parent species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Muscovy ducks are not considered established in the wild in New Zealand. During the 1999-2004 bird atlas survey, Muscovy ducks were recorded in more than 1 per cent of the New Zealand mainland squares. They are sparsely distributed throughout the mainland on lakes, ponds, slow-flowing streams, and adjacent pasture close to human habitation. An attempted introduction to Adams Island, Auckland Islands in 1865 was not successful.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No population estimates are available. Birds that live in a semi-wild state are bolstered by birds that escape from captivity or are illegally released. They are the second-most commonly kept species of duck in New Zealand (after mallards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Muscovy ducks are not known to have any negative ecological or biological impacts. Because of their grazing habits, it is possible they would cause damage to pastures if they were to increase in numbers. They are not protected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Muscovy ducks nest in tree holes and hollows, as well as on the ground in areas with dense ground cover. The nest bowl is composed of debris and dead vegetation and is lined with the breast feathers of the female, which incubates the eggs and raises the young alone. Feral birds can breed year-round. There may be ten or more of the off-white eggs per clutch, and they have an incubation period of 35 days. Breeding success of New Zealand birds has not been investigated.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As most Muscovy ducks are&#xA0;recently escaped from captivity they not wary of humans and will allow a close approach. They are capable flyers, but are reluctant to do so. Their long claws assist with perching in trees. They do not form large flocks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feral Muscovy ducks often rely on hand-outs from humans. They also graze on grass and herbs, and sometimes take insects and even small vertebrates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy_duck\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy_duck</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Fitter, J.; Merton, D. 2011. <em>Birds of New Zealand</em>.

Here and there it extends downriver from these refugia into waters of modest gradient (50-80 m fall per km) provided riparian forest persists and the river runs clean.</p>\n<p>Principal physical correlates of habitat presently occupied include a stable river channel, coarse riverbed substrata, high water clarity, narrow stream/river widths, shallow river margins, pool and riffle sequences and forested river margins.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>A slow and insidious contraction of blue duck range continues, especially in remote South Island areas (parts of Fiordland, West Coast, and northwest Nelson) while some substantial population increases have occurred recently in selected areas where persistent and extensive riverside predator control is practised (western central North Island rivers, northern Te Urewera, Motueka region, Paparoa, Te Anau-Milford area). There is a high prevalence of unpaired males on rivers without predator control. The breeding population is unlikely to be more than 1000 pairs (2011 estimate).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Nesting females are especially vulnerable to mammalian predators, particularly stoats and possums, while rats and weka have been implicated in nest and egg destructions. The duck&#x2019;s widespread declines throughout South Island beech (<em>Nothofagus</em>) forests areas has highlighted the insidious effects of mast-seeding of beech trees fuelling a mouse population boom, closely followed by stoat increases and, when mice numbers crash, the predators focus on hole-nesting birds and vulnerable ground nesters like blue ducks.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of small scale riparian predator trapping programmes points to a conservation remedy. However, with blue ducks residing at low densities (an average of 1 pair per km of river), the scale at which this remedy has to be applied to protect remaining populations is daunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Blue ducks are monogamous and fiercely territorial; the territory and pair bond are maintained throughout the year. In the North Island, nesting begins in late August, with the first ducklings usually in late September. Breeding is approximately 3-weeks later in much of the South Island. Renesting is uncommon and rarely occurs later than November. Nests are generally well hidden from above and sites include riverside caves, holes in river banks, at bases of fern clumps or beneath fallen trees. Nests are generally close to the river edge. While the female is incubating, the male waits on the riverside in close proximity to the nest. The pale white eggs (each 60-65 g) are laid at 1.5-2 day intervals (e.g. 5 eggs in 8 days, 6 eggs in 10 days). The average clutch is 5 or 6 (range 3 &#x2013; 8) and the incubation period extends for 33-35 days. Both parents guard the ducklings during their 70-80 days until fledging and the brood is raised entirely within the territory. The mature ducklings gradually disperse from the territory when their parents start their post-breeding moult and are forcibly challenged and evicted by the adults after moulting. Average productivity is 1.3 fledglings /pr/yr.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Blue ducks are generally encountered year-round as territorial pairs dispersed serially along a river, with occasional single males attempting to claim space between widely separated pairs. Once established, the territory is generally held for life. Mate changes (whether of male or female) as a consequence of death or displacement rarely induce a change in territory location and pattern of use. Juveniles first attempt to establish territories near their natal territory. This causes high levels of genetic relatedness within sections of rivers and strong genetic patterning between rivers. Settlement of birds in rivers beyond their natal catchment is very rare.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Blue ducks have a diet comprised almost exclusively of freshwater invertebrates, of which chironomid larvae and cased caddis fly larvae are the most prominent. Essentially any freshwater invertebrate is eaten and there is no evidence of selective feeding. Berries from streamside plants have been recorded in the diet of alpine-dwelling ducks but not elsewhere. During periods of prolonged river spate, the birds scrape at silt-laden rocks consuming silt and periphyton. Ducklings feed on the same foods as adults, and dive in shallow water within days of first reaching the river.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Duck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Duck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/whio\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/whio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/blue-duck-whio/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/blue-duck-whio/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whio.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whio.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/about-us/our-partners/our-national-partners/genesis-energy-whio-recovery-programme/?id=33341\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/about-us/our-partners/our-national-partners/genesis-energy-whio-recovery-programme/?id=33341</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Kear, J.

The bird is extremely nomadic. This nomadic way of life enables the bird to quickly exploit shallow temporary water during irregular flooding in the interior of Australia.

Some male chestnut teal in eclipse plumage have a pale patch on the flank at the base of the tail, which becomes white in breeding plumage, when their bright chestnut plumage and green head make them very different to grey teal<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Grey teal are a breeding species in Australia, New Guinea, Indonesia, New Zealand, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. They are widespread in New Zealand, with the greatest concentrations in Canterbury (especially Lake Ellesmere), South Auckland, Waikato, Hawkes Bay and Otago. The first specimens in New Zealand were obtained by Sir Walter Buller in 1866 from the Manawatu district, but at that time they were known to be plentiful in Rotorua at Ohinemutu and Lake Rotomahana. Grey teal have been recorded as vagrants on the Chatham Islands (July 1951, December 1998), Snares Islands (November 1987), Enderby Island, Auckland Islands (January 2012) and Campbell Island (October 2012).</p>\n<p>Most grey teal occur in areas below 300 m above sea level and they are rare above 900 m. The preferred habitat is shallow freshwater lakes, lagoons and swamps with extensive marginal cover, but at times birds are seen on salt and brackish water.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The grey teal is one of the most numerous ducks in Australia, and is one of the most common birds shot there in the hunting season, particularly in inland areas, but in New Zealand its hunting is prohibited. The New Zealand population was estimated at 20,000 birds in 1976, and had increased to an estimated 50,000 birds by 2005, with the main increase being 20,000 birds on Lake Ellesmere. Consideration was given to adding the grey teal to the game bird list when the Wildlife Act was reviewed in 2010, but the grey teal remains fully protected in New Zealand. Globally the grey teal is believed to number more than 1,000,000 birds. Grey teal in New Zealand and Australia have a relatively high mortality rate. Particularly in Australia recruitment is erratic. Populations rise very rapidly in times of flooding, but decline during dry periods. Two Australian mortality studies obtained similar results: 60% died in the first year of life, 80% in the first two years and 96% before the end of the fourth year. Similarly for the New Zealand population, it was found that 68% died in the first year of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>In New Zealand at least 6% of the population is shot during the five week hunting season, which is high considering that hunting of this species is prohibited. Introduced mammalian predators, especially ferrets and stoats which are common in wetland locations, are a major threat to adults and their broods. Swamp harriers, eels and rats are also known to take ducklings when on the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia grey teal are adapted to breeding in shallow temporary water; they have no fixed breeding season and can breed at any time of the year when food is abundant. In the dry interior of Australia the bird is extremely mobile and is one of the first ducks to arrive in a locality in preparation for breeding after flooding. In New Zealand, the breeding appears to be seasonal beginning in June and can extend to January. Breeding probably commences at one year of age. Nest sites can be found in tree hollows and on the ground under the bower of tall grasses. They also readily accept nest boxes. Clutches consist of five to nine cream coloured eggs. Egg dumping by other females can increase the clutch size. Pair-bonds are retained from one season to the next. The female incubates, but the male helps in defending the ducklings. Like all ducks there is synchronous hatching.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey teal are very mobile. Movements within New Zealand appear to be random, with birds dispersing in all directions. Some of the movements are achieved in a very short period of time. For example, a teal marked at Mangere in Auckland was shot the next day 125 km away. In New Zealand and Australia rapid changes in numbers can occur at any locality. Local populations can appear fairly constant, but their composition changes as individuals arrive and depart. In Australia, during drought conditions very extensive movements and great mortality occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Grey teal are normally nocturnal feeders but are frequently seen forging at dawn and dusk<strong>. </strong>They feed on small aquatic insects, molluscs and the seeds of swamp plants. Food is obtained by filtering the surface water and the mud. In Australia the bulk of the diet consists of plant material (87-97% by volume), mostly seeds. Insects are eaten throughout the year, but especially in the spring, while mollusca and crustacea are important in the diet only in the autumn and spring. Invertebrates and molluscs are obtained by filtering the surface water and by dredging mud at the waters edge, and seeds are obtained by stripping the plants on the waters edge or near water. In Australia downy chicks feed exclusively on insects but the relative amount decrease to only 30% by four weeks of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Teal\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Teal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=451\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=451</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0AvAnserif/anatidae/1acravan_anas/Anas_gracilis/Anas_gracilis.htm\">http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0AvAnserif/anatidae/1acravan_anas/Anas_gracilis/Anas_gracilis.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Frith, H.J. 1959.

They were also formerly on Chatham Island until about 1925, and Stewart Island until 1972. Brown teal are now mostly restricted to northern North Island (Northland, Great Barrier Island and Coromandel Peninsula) but have been recently re-introduced to Kapiti and Mana Islands and the Zealandia Sanctuary in Wellington, and to a private sanctuary in Hawkes Bay. A recent trial release in Fiordland has returned teal to an area in which a few wild birds lingered till the late 1990s.</p>\n<p>Brown teal formerly exploited a wide range of habitats including wet forests, extensive and occluded swamps, slow-flowing streams, lakes and estuaries. Their present day habitat lies mostly in agricultural environments wherein the birds use occluded stock ponds as breeding and feeding sites, and also margins of small streams that retain overhanging marginal vegetation. Some birds still feed in estuaries on Great Barrier Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The brown teal population was estimated at 1500-2500 birds in 2011. Population estimates for the three principal aggregations in Northland, Great Barrier Island and Coromandel are usually extrapolated from counts of birds at summer flock sites but there remains uncertainty about what proportion of each population assembles at these sites. Recently established populations elsewhere comprise approximately 100 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The brown teal is probably the least secure of New Zealand&#x2019;s three brown-plumaged teals on account of its vulnerability to and exposure to mammalian predators, and to ongoing deterioration of agricultural habitats in which it is forced to reside. Recovery of teal populations on mainland sites requires permanent and assiduous predator control or predator exclusion. Although Great Barrier Island presently lacks mustelids and has limited pastoral farming, expanding human settlements and household pets threaten the population&#x2019;s expansion there.</p>\n<p>Brown teal are extensively bred in captivity for reintroduction attempts, but enduring success of these attempts remains elusive.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Brown teal are monogamous and generally fiercely territorial. Most nesting is in late winter (July-September) but broods have been encountered in most months except late autumn. Typically nests are buried in dry locations deep within bases of rush, grass or fern clumps near water. Large pale fawn eggs, each about 10-11% of the female&#x2019;s body weight, are generally laid daily. The average clutch is 5 or 6 (range 3 &#x2013; 9) and the incubation period extends for about 28 days. Both parents guard the ducklings during their 50-55 days until fledging; the brood is usually raised within the territory.</p>\n<p>The mature ducklings are forcefully evicted from the territory on or about the time the parents start their post-breeding moult.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Brown teal populations generally comprise a single aggregated flock and numerous widely dispersed pairs. Some pairs may occupy exclusive territories year-round in water-rich locations whereas others vacate their territories seasonally and return to them when autumn rains replenish water levels. These territories contain abundant food and escape cover and suitable nesting and brood-rearing habitat. Pairs using streams as territorial sites will forage and nest well beyond the stream margins.</p>\n<p>Flocks arise from mid-summer aggregations of recent fledglings and of early moulted adults whose winter ranges have dried out. Other seasonally displaced adults also join but will leave the flock following autumn rains. Non-breeding birds may remain as a flock through winter and spring.</p>\n<p>Brown teal are generally crepuscular to nocturnal in habit in agricultural and forested environments but at coastal sites feeding and loafing activity may also be influenced by tides, the birds being more active at low tides.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Brown teal diet is diverse. A study from Great Barrier Island recorded 78 taxa including terrestrial, freshwater and marine invertebrates, fungi, and terrestrial and freshwater vegetation. Terrestrial foods included seeds of sedges, clover leaves, cased caddisfly larvae, beetles, caterpillars, moths and earthworms. In inter-tidal areas teal dabbled in soft sediments to extract gastropods and bivalves, crustacean and polychaete worms. They also extract flesh from cockles and small mussels. On freshwater ponds, teal have been observed eating leaves of various wetland plants.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Teal\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Teal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/brown-teal-pateke/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/brown-teal-pateke/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://brownteal.com/\">http://brownteal.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/pateke.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/pateke.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Kear, J.

They also occur along peaty streams and on pools in wetlands with abundant sedge and tussock cover. On Disappointment Island it lives in seepages amongst seabird burrows and mollymawk nests and without access to the shoreline. On Adams Island it can be encountered occasionally in streams high up on the island&#x2019;s southern slopes.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island teal are commonly seen but never numerous. The population is likely to exceed 1000 following their recent increase on Enderby and Rose Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island teal occur on seven pest-free islands but birds have not been able to re-establish on main Auckland Island in the presence of the pigs and cats which contributed to their exterminated there.&#xA0; Eradication of rabbits from Enderby and Rose Islands in 1993 resulted in an increase of teal on both islands following recovery of grasses and rushes along streams and along sheltered shorelines. They are probably the most secure of all three of New Zealand&#x2019;s brown-plumaged teals.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island teal are monogamous and fiercely territorial. Territories along shorelines are the smallest (40 &#x2013; 100 m2) and those covering sparse wave platforms and grassland the largest (1000 &#x2013; 3700 m2). All reproductive activity is confined to territory. Males often loaf conspicuously at the shoreline edge of their territories.</p>\n<p>Egg-laying may commence at end of October and first broods are encountered in early December. Young broods have been observed in March and April suggesting relaying by early failed breeders. Each pale fawn egg weighs almost 15% of the female&#x2019;s body weight which is, proportionately, one of the largest eggs laid by any waterfowl. Incubation of the 3-4 eggs is by the female alone and lasts 30-35 days. The nest site, usually well secreted at the base of tussock or sedge clumps or in fern, is used as a daytime refuge for the growing young. Both adults contribute parental care.

Was there such a thing as a Campbell Island teal, or were the few birds seen there stray Auckland Island teal from the islands of the same name, 270 km away? Did a population persist somewhere in the Campbell Island group? These questions were answered in dramatic fashion in 1973, when a tiny population was discovered on Dent Island, a 23 ha islet off Campbell Island. Eleven birds were extracted from this population, in 1983 and 1990, and a captive breeding programme ensued. In 1999-2000 24 birds were released onto Codfish Island off Stewart Island. After rats were eradicated from Campbell Island in 2001, 150 captive-bred and Codfish Island-bred teal were released onto Campbell Island in 2004-06. The captive breeding programme ceased thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Campbell Island teal is the smallest of the three brown-plumaged teals endemic to the New Zealand region. Both sexes are darkish brown, but are sexually dimorphic in plumage and size. Males are entirely dark sepia with a green iridescence on the head and back, dark chestnut breast, a paler brown abdomen and a conspicuous white patch at the tail base. Females are a uniformly dark brown with a paler abdomen. Both sexes have a conspicuous white eye ring, dark-grey bill, legs and feet, and dark brown eye.

Male calls are soft trills or piping, given in alarm and in territorial defence. Females have a rasping growl and a high-pitched and rapid quack.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the flighted brown teal of the New Zealand mainland is larger, more colourful when in breeding plumage, and has wings that extend to the base of the tail when folded. The flightless Auckland Island teal at the Auckland Islands is slightly larger and paler, but can only be separated from Campbell Island teal by location.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are endemic to Campbell Island. A small population, sourced from captive-raised birds has persisted on Codfish Island, off Stewart Island, since 1999. The main population on Campbell Island is derived from birds re-introduced in 2004-06, bolstered by natural recolonisations by birds swimming from Dent Island.</p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are considerably more furtive than their Auckland Island relatives. They are most likely to be encountered at the shoreline picking among rocks or any beach-cast seaweed, and along peaty streams and about pools in wetlands with profuse sedge and tussock cover in Perseverance Harbour, Campbell Island. They also occurs on Six-foot Lake, at the head of Northeast Harbour and in Northwest Bay on Campbell Island and at Sealers Bay and adjacent Penguin Bay on Codfish Island.</p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal persist on Dent Island off Campbell Island&#x2019;s Northwest Bay, their sole refuge after rats invaded Campbell Island in the early 1800s. There they survive in tiny numbers in seepages amongst seabird burrows and occasionally straggle across the 3 km sea gap to Campbell Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are secretive at Campbell Island, making population estimation difficult. The most recent attempt to locate birds on the island (2009) indicated a minimum presence of 102 birds. Populations on Dent and Codfish Islands have not been surveyed in the past decade, but both are probably tiny (&lt;30 birds).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The Campbell Island teal came very close to extinction, with a tiny remnant population surviving on Dent Island after Norway rats wiped out the main population on 11,000 ha Campbell Island. The captive-breeding programme took many years to produce any young, and in the end only one of the three wild females brought into captivity produced offspring. The entire captive-bred population is descended from this one female, and the Campbell Island teals has among the lowest level of genetic variation measured in any wild bird population. Any return of rats to Campbell Island would severely threaten this species and most likely force a resumption of past captive breeding efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are probably monogamous and strongly territorial, and with all reproductive activity and feeding confined to the territory. On Codfish Island, egg-laying commences at the end of November, and newly-hatched broods are encountered from early January to February. From 14 nests there, clutch size was 2-5 pale fawn eggs (mean 3.5). On Campbell Island, incubated nests containing clutches of 4 and 5 eggs have been found from mid-November to mid-December.</p>\n<p>Eggs laid in captivity averaged 62 x 43 mm with a calculated weight of 65 g, approx. 15-20% of a wild female&#x2019;s body weight. Both adults contribute parental care. Fledging period in the wild is unknown but in captivity, ducklings reach adult weight in 50-60 days.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island teal are difficult to study in the wild due to the inaccessibility of the sites where they occur, the dense vegetation they inhabit, and the birds&#x2019; furtive and nocturnal behaviour. Pairs probably maintain territories year-round. On Codfish Island a small flock sometimes gathers at the mouth of Sealers Creek. Campbell Island teal are rarely active during the day or venture far from protective cover. At night they have been observed feeding on tidal flats at the head of Perseverance Harbour, Campbell Island and fossicking along the inlet&#x2019;s rocky shoreline.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of Campbell Island teal is unknown in the wild, but they are probably omnivorous with a preference for invertebrates. They have been observed stripping seeds from rushes and grass seedheads and dabbling in peaty ooze and along a stream edge on Codfish Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Website</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Teal\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Teal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/offshore-islands/new-zealands-subantarctic-islands/campbell-island/teal-returned-to-campbell-island/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/offshore-islands/new-zealands-subantarctic-islands/campbell-island/teal-returned-to-campbell-island/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://terranature.org/tealcampbell_island.htm\">http://terranature.org/tealcampbell_island.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=9819\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=9819</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Kear, J. 2005. <em>Ducks, geese and swans</em>.

The northern pintail inhabits open, shallow wetlands, breeding across the northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America. It is highly migratory, wintering mainly south of its breeding grounds, almost as far as the equator. Vagrants reach Micronesia, Polynesia and New Guinea, with at least four records from Australia, and a single bird seen in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The northern pintail is a fairly large, slender dabbling duck. It is larger than teal species but smaller than a mallard. The drake in breeding plumage is unmistakable. At a distance it appears a mainly grey with a chocolate-brown head and neck, and with a white stripe extending from the white breast and lower neck up the side of the neck to eye-level. The back and sides have a grey, brown and black pattern, with a creamy patch anterior to the black under-tail coverts. The two black central tail feathers are greatly elongated, making up about a quarter of the bird&#x2019;s total length. The female is brown, but its slender body, long thin neck and pointed tail, together with smallish head with a grey bill, make it recognisable at close range. The male in eclipse (non-breeding) plumage is similar to the female. Both sexes have a fast, graceful flight when the slender body, long neck and tail, and pointed wings are apparent. Both sexes show a dark speculum bordered white at the rear, especially prominent in the female.</p>\n<p>Voice: the male&#x2019;s call is a soft whistle whilst the female has a mallard-like quack.</p>\n<p>Similar species: breeding males are unmistakeable. Females and males in eclipse are smaller than a mallard, with relatively longer necks, grey bills and unstriped, speckled buff faces. The grey teal has similar facial markings (or lack thereof) to northern pintail but is smaller and more compact with a greyer face, red eye and prominent white triangle on the upperwing (northern pintail wing markings resemble those of the mallard).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The northern pintail breeds across the northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America. They are highly migratory, wintering mainly south of the breeding range from about 40&#x2070;N almost to the equator in Panama, Africa and Asia. There have been many cases of lateral migration with birds from Russia and Japan being recovered in North America, and birds from Canada recovered in the United Kingdom. Small numbers migrate from North America to Pacific islands, especially Hawaii where a few hundred winter each year. Vagrants have been recorded in Polynesia, Micronesia and New Guinea with about four records from Australia.</p>\n<p>The breeding habitat is in open, shallow wetlands, whilst in winter it frequents sheltered coastal waters, estuaries, brackish water, as well as shallow, open freshwater wetlands.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>A single record; a male in breeding plumage was discovered on Farewell Spit on 19 October 1997. It was with a small flock of mallards on a flooded pan. The bird was found again two days later but not seen again. The date was consistent with a bird overshooting on its southward migration.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Northern pintails are generally shy and wary. Large congregations can occur on the wintering grounds. Birds feed mostly on plant material taken whilst dabbling, that is, up-ending in shallow water where their long necks allow them to feed in deeper water than other dabbling ducks. Feeding is mainly in the evening and at night, and invertebrates are added to the diet during the breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Pintail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Pintail</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Pintail/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Pintail/id</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=457\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=457</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Marchant, S.J.; Higgins, P.

After breeding, birds disperse widely over the North Pacific Ocean, mainly north-east, towards coastal waters of North America. Occasional records in the southern hemisphere, including one of a bird collected in July 1884 at Dusky Sound in Fiordland. Birds forage over deep water, near coasts and in open ocean. Several birds tracked by satellite flew over 15,000 km from their breeding grounds in the Hawaiian archipelago to the continental shelf off Oregon and northern California during foraging trips.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There is an estimated global population of 64,500 breeding pairs in at least 14 locations. The largest populations are circa 24,000 and 21,000 pairs on Midway Atoll and Laysan Island respectively, together accounting for 73% of the global population. On Torishima Island, 914 chicks were reared from 1,219 pairs in 1998, compared with 20 in 1964.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"EN-NZ\" xml:lang=\"EN-NZ\">Until 2013 this species was classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List, mainly due to fisheries bycatch. It was reclassified as Near Threatened in December 2013 after analysis of recent data suggested its population is not undergoing a rapid on-going decline and is now either stable or increasing. Other threats include ingestion of marine plastic debris and predation by introduced predators. Birds sometimes eat plastic debris at sea, mistaking it for food. When this is regurgitated and fed to chicks they can die from starvation as a result of a blocked digestive tract. All introduced predators (except house mice on Midway) have been eradicated from the north-western Hawaiian Islands. Feral cats are present on Wake Island and rats are present on Lehua and Kaula islands, and the Japanese breeding islands. Introduced predators may be a factor inhibiting re-colonisation at some historical breeding islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>A colonial, annual breeder at the north-western Hawaiian Islands (USA) and several outlying islands of Japan, with small numbers breeding at several islands on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Colonies often associated with other seabirds. Elaborate courtship displays include bowing, preening, head-shaking, bill-touching, bill-circling, sky-pointing, and flank-touching. Pairs approach closely while opening wings and performing a mutual dance. Birds arrive at colonies in October. Monogamous, with adults taking a break from breeding in some years. A single white egg with brown spots is laid mid-November to mid-December. The nest is a scrape sometimes ringed with grass, located near beaches. Incubation of 65-66 days and chick-rearing of 140-147 days shared by both parents. Chicks fledge and depart during June-July. Age at first breeding 5-8 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Breeds on coastal beaches on tropical and subtropical islands and atolls with sparse vegetation. During incubation, adult birds at Tern Island forage in the vicinity of the island. The foraging range extends during chick rearing to include the distant and more productive Californian Current. Forages singly or in groups, sometimes in hundreds, mostly during daytime. Catches prey at the sea surface by surface-seizing and surface-diving. Follows fishing vessels to scavenge discarded fish offal and grab baits from submerged longline hooks.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Feeds mainly on flying fish and their eggs, other fish, squid and shrimp, fish offal discarded from fishing vessels, and carrion including other birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3957\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3957</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Cousins, K.; Cooper, J. 2000.

It resembles the slightly larger black-browed mollymawk of the southern hemisphere. Most Laysan albatrosses breed in the Hawaiian archipelago, with smaller numbers breeding on outlying islands of Japan and Mexico. Large numbers were killed for the feather trade in the early 1900s, to reduce risk of airstrike in 1940s-1950s, and in the 1990s to early 2000s when birds were caught and drowned in commercial longline fisheries. More recently numbers have increased and the species was downlisted from Vulnerable to Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2010. The global population is an estimated 2.5 million individuals. After breeding, birds disperse widely over North Pacific Ocean. The occasional records in the southern hemisphere include one from New Zealand in 1995.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The Laysan albatross has a white head, body and undertail, contrasting with the black mantle, upperwings, back and tail. In flight, the largely white underwings show black margins and variable black streaking on the coverts, and the pinkish feet project beyond the tail. A dark patch surrounds&#xA0;each eye, grading to grey below the eye and onto the cheek. The long pinkish bill has a grey-black tip. The sexes are alike, with the male slightly larger. Juveniles resemble adults but with a greyer bill and darker rump, and sometimes with darker underwings.</p>\n<p>Voice: the adult repertoire includes groaning and gurgling sounds made while feeding at sea; cries and whines accompany breeding displays.</p>\n<p>Similar species: adults resemble the slightly larger black-browed mollymawk but have more extensive black and grey around the eyes and face, and longer, pinker bills that grade to buff and grey-black at the tip. The bill of the juvenile black-browed mollymawk is similar but loses the blackish colouring at the tip with age, becoming orange-yellow. The much larger adult short-tailed albatross has a yellowish head, white back and pink bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Virtually all breeding Laysan albatrosses form colonies on islands and atolls in the north-western Hawaiian archipelago, with far fewer birds in small colonies on islands off <a title=\"Baja California\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California\" target=\"_blank\">Baja California</a> (Mexico) and outlying islands of Japan. In the early 1900s, breeding populations were wiped out on <a title=\"Wake\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Island\" target=\"_blank\">Wake</a> and <a title=\"Johnston\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_Atoll\" target=\"_blank\">Johnston</a> atolls and <a title=\"Minami Torishima\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minami-Tori-shima\" target=\"_blank\">Minami Torishima</a> in central Pacific. Birds disperse to sea in the North Pacific Ocean in the non-breeding season. Occasional records in the southern hemisphere include one from New Zealand close to a fishing vessel near Lachlan Banks, 30 km off Cape Kidnappers, Hawkes Bay, in December 1995.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of Laysan albatrosses is estimated at 2.5 million individuals, including c. 600,000 breeding pairs, with the largest colonies on Midway Atoll and Laysan Island in the Hawaiian archipelago. Some monitored populations increased during 1980-1995 but did not return to the numbers observed prior to large-scale exploitation for the feather trade in the early 1900s. Another study indicated an overall c.30% decline during 1992-2002. Since then the breeding population appears to have increased and the population trend stabilised.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The main threats to Laysan albatross are commercial fishing, ingestion of plastic debris, and sea-level rise. Discarded waste plastic at sea is commonly mistaken for food items. An estimated 98% of Laysan albatross chicks were fed plastic beads, synthetic foam, fishing line, buttons, cigarette lighters, beach toys, PVC piping, plastic bags, golf tees, plastic gloves, marker pens and aluminium foil by parental birds that swallowed the objects at sea, mistaking them for genuine food items. Once swallowed such items often block and damage the bird&#x2019;s digestive system, leading to starvation and death. Hawaiian breeding sites are protected as part of the US conservation estate. In 2006, the Papah&#xE2;naumoku&#xE2;kea Marine National Monument established a no-take marine reserve encompassing all the north-western Hawaiian Islands. In 1991, a 50-nautical mile Protected Species Zone was established around the north-western Hawaiian Islands, prohibiting longline fishing. The Hawaiian longline fleet is also required to use measures that reduce seabird bycatch. Predators are controlled at colonies. Reclassified from Vulnerable to Not Threatened by IUCN in 2010.</p>\n<p>All of the large Laysan albatross colonies are on low lying atolls, where the breeding birds are vulnerable to storm surge and tsunami. About a thousand adults and tens of thousands of chicks were killed on <a title=\"Midway Atoll\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll\" target=\"_blank\">Midway Atoll</a> by the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi tsunami, highlighting the vulnerability of breeding Laysan albatrosses to sea-level rise associated with global climate change.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The Laysan albatross is an annual colonial breeder with a protracted breeding cycle, usually starting in November. Some birds skip breeding in some years. The first 7-9 years of life are spent at sea, before birds return to land for first breeding. The nest is a shallow sand scrape or small debris-sand mound built on open ground near vegetation. Elaborate courtship displays include mutual bill touching and sky-pointing, in which bird stands on &apos;tip-toes&apos;, stretches neck and points bill skywards. Laysan albatross are monogamous; the single large buff-white egg is incubated by both adults for c.65 days, followed by a c.160 day chick-rearing period. Both adults feed the chick regurgitated food items and stomach oils, alternating several day at-sea foraging trips. One bird aged 62-years reportedly bred in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The Laysan albatross is an open ocean marine species that comes ashore to breed on sandy open areas on atolls and islands. First-time breeders have elaborate courtship displays that establish pair bonds, often lasting decades. During incubation, adult birds at one island foraged in adjacent waters, extending trips further offshore as chicks developed to reach more distant, more productive waters. Birds catch prey at the surface by surface-seizing and surface-diving, often at night, and sometimes follow fishing vessels in large noisy flocks to scavenge discarded fish or offal and baits set on longline hooks. Fledging birds swimming near colonies are often preyed on by tiger sharks.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Laysan albatrosses eat squid, fish, offal and crustaceans.

The sexes are alike, with juveniles having a white head and an all-black bill.</p>\n<p>Voice: the adult repertoire includes loud braying wails, high-pitched repeated notes, and low-pitched croaking. Chicks make gulping <em>&quot;cop-cop&quot; </em>and squawking sounds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Atlantic Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawk is similar, but with a greyer head and a larger dark triangle in front of the eye. These two species together differ from other mollymawks in&#xA0;their small size, slender build, white underwings and long slender bill, making the bird appear elongated compared to other mollymawk species. Juveniles are distinguishable from juveniles of other mollymawk species (all of which have dark bills) by their whiter underwing and long, slender bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Indian Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawks breed on subantarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean: Amsterdam, Crozet, Kerguelen, St Paul Islands (<a title=\"French Southern Lands\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Southern_and_Antarctic_Lands\">French Southern Lands</a>) and the Prince Edward Islands (South Africa). One or two pairs have bred on The Pyramid in the Chatham Islands since 1998. Outside the breeding season, birds disperse throughout the southern Indian Ocean between 37-47&#xB0;S. Most birds disperse to seas off southern Africa and south-western Australia, with a range extending east to the Tasman Sea and north-eastern New Zealand. Both adults and juveniles occasionally occur in New Zealand waters during winter off eastern Northland and in the Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Plenty in the North Island, and off Tasman Bay and the Kaikoura Peninsula in the South Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Total world population of Indian Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawks is estimated at 41,580 pairs, or 83,160 mature individuals, equating to possibly more than 160,000 individuals in all age classes. The number of birds visiting New Zealand waters has declined greatly since the 1980s, when they were the most frequently observed mollymawk species in the outer Hauraki Gulf in winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The Indian Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawk is listed as Endangered (A4bde) by the IUCN Red List on the basis of an estimated very rapid ongoing decline over three generations (71 years). This decline is the result of the number of adult birds drowned and killed as bycatch in commercial fisheries, poor recruitment, and disease. The Amsterdam Island population declined after outbreaks of diseases in the early 1980s. Interactions with commercial longline fisheries could also account for observed decreases given that up to 600 may be killed annually. During the breeding season, birds are caught and killed in tuna longline fisheries in subtropical waters and longline fisheries that target Patagonian toothfish around the Prince Edward Islands. Birds are also killed in pelagic longline and trawl fisheries off southern Africa. There has&#xA0;been one report of a bird caught on a demersal longline set off the east coast of the lower North Island, New Zealand. The Department of Conservation classifies it as a coloniser in New Zealand that is threatened overseas.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Indian Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawks nest in dense colonies of up to 23,000 pairs, on vegetated or rocky cliffs. Colonies are mixed with black-browed and grey-headed mollymawks at Kerguelen Islands, and with Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguins at Amsterdam Island. Elaborate courtship displays include aerial activity, croaking, bill-kissing, bill-clashing, bowing, scooping, and mutual preening. Indian Ocean yellow-nosed albatrosses are monogamous with long-term pair-bonds. The single large white egg with brown mottling or blotches is laid in September or October. The nest is a cylindrical cone of mud and grasses 30-60 cm high, usually located on rocky cliffs or in depressions or ravines among tussock, or under scrub near open spaces. Incubation of 71-78 days and chick-rearing of 130 days are shared by both parents. Birds arrive at colonies in August, and mate in September. Eggs hatch in November or December, and chicks fledge in March and April. The average age at first breeding is 9 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Indian Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawks breed annually, either singly or in loose or dense colonies. They are solitary or gregarious at sea, where birds follow fishing vessels in large numbers to scavenge discarded fish offal. Satellite-tracking of birds at Amsterdam Island shows breeding adults forage up to 1500 km from the colony.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Indian Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawks feed on fish and squid, and less frequently on crustaceans. They catch prey by surface seizing and shallow diving.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Yellow-nosed_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Yellow-nosed_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30015\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30015</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/295-indian-yellow-nosed-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/295-indian-yellow-nosed-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gales, R. 1998.

Its striking grey-and-white plumage, and bright bill markings make it one of the most beautiful of the marine birds. It is a bird of cold, deep water, and is therefore a rare sight around the New Zealand mainland. Most claimed sightings are likely to be of the very similar-looking Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk. </p>\n<p>Unlike most albatrosses, grey-headed mollymawks show little interest in boats. They prefer very low-productivity zones in the ocean, and from their breeding site at Campbell Island make the 1500 km trek to the richer waters of the Polar Front, between New Zealand and Antarctica to feed on squid and fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The grey-headed mollymawk is a large white-bodied bird with handsome grey head plumage. Their black-and-yellow bill is striking, with brownish-black side-plates and bright yellow plates above and below the bill. The bill is hooked, with prominent nostrils, and may have a reddish tint on the curve of the bill hook. The back and upper wings are brownish-black, as is the tail. The distinguishing feature from other similar small albatrosses is the underwing, which is white with a broad dark leading edge particularly into the &#x2018;elbow&#x2019;. Other similar species have more white on the underwing. Juveniles have a completely dark bill, but are otherwise similar to adults, though often with a diagnostic whitish patch on the cheek contrasting with the otherwise dark head. As their plumage wears, the head becomes white, leaving a grey partial collar. In this plumage they may be indistinguishable from immature black-browed and Campbell black-browed mollymawks, although these usually have a bi-coloured bill, darker at the tip, cf. the all-dark bill of immature grey-headed mollymawks </p>\n<p>Voice: a braying call, repeated nap-nap-nap sound, and at times sounds like a small chainsaw starting.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk has whitish cap, a broader base to the yellow upper bill, and a narrower dark leading edge to the underwing. Atlantic yellow-nosed mollymawk is a slimmer build, has a longer, slimmer bill with no yellow on the lower mandible, a paler grey head, and a much whiter underwing. Some &#x2018;white-headed&#x2019; immature grey-headed mollymawks may be indistinguishable from immature black-browed and Campbell black-browed mollymawks (see above).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-headed mollymawks are found around the Southern Ocean, with a circumpolar breeding distribution. They nest on coastal cliffs in the same areas as black-browed mollymawks and Campbell black-browed mollymawks, often on the margins of their colonies. They tend to be solitary at sea, and don&#x2019;t follow vessels or scavenge on fisheries waste to the same extent as many other small albatrosses. In the New Zealand region, they nest at Campbell Island and on nearby Macquarie Island. </p>\n<p>Their feeding habitat tends to be oceanic (&gt;2000 m water depth) rather than over continental shelves and they occur in the New Zealand region mainly well offshore and south of Cook Strait, but may be found around East Cape, particularly during the austral autumn.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The population on Campbell Island has been monitored sporadically since the 1940s, and showed a major decrease in numbers during the 1970s and 1990s. Around 6,600 breeding pairs are currently present; allowing for a similar number of pre-breeders, this is about 10% of the global population of c.250,000 birds. </p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>There are currently no introduced mammals on Campbell Island, which is the only site where grey-headed mollymawks breed in New Zealand (Norway rats and previously feral cats were present until eradicated in 2001). The main threats are likely to result from changes in food availability within foraging distance from Campbell Island, if birds need to fly further while feeding chicks. Movement of the Polar Front away from Campbell Island is thought to have been the cause of the massive population decline on Campbell Island in the mid-to-late 20th Century. Occasional incidental mortality has been recorded in longline fisheries, but it is rare for grey-headed mollymawks to be caught (unlike several other albatross species). The conservation status of this species in New Zealand was moved from nationally critical to nationally vulnerable in 2013 while the global IUCN Red List threat status was changed from globally vulnerable to globally endangered in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-headed mollymawks form long-term monogamous pairs, and (unlike most mollymawks) typically breed only once every 2 years. They return to the colony in September, and the single egg (107 x 67 mm) is laid in October. Incubation is shared and takes about 72 days, with the egg hatching in January or February. The chick is fed by regurgitation by both parents, and fledges at a mean age of 141 days-old, in about May. This September to May breeding cycle is only 3 weeks longer than Campbell Island black-browed mollymawks breeding at the same site (which fledge their chicks at 120-125 days-old), but this is apparently enough of a difference to require grey-headed mollymawks to take a break of 16 months to complete their moult before breeding again, cf. 5 months for the annually-breeding Campbell Island black-browed mollymawks. Grey-headed mollymawks first breed when 8-20 years-old, and may live for 30 or more years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-headed mollymawks are solitary at sea, although they may raft in small groups. They are poor divers (to less than 6 m water depth) and feed by scavenging mainly at the surface. During breeding, birds on foraging trips from Campbell Island often flew to the Polar Front, which lies 1000-1500 km south of Campbell Island. </p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of grey-headed mollymawks on Campbell Island consisted mainly of squid, in particular species associated with the Polar Front. Fish (e.g. southern blue whiting) were also consumed. Grey-headed mollymawks elsewhere consume a lot of krill, but this was a minor component of the diet at Campbell Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites &#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey-headed_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey-headed_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22698398/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22698398/0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/248-grey-headed-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/248-grey-headed-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p align=\"left\">Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 2012.

In flight, the underwings show broad black margins that are wider on the leading edge with a wedge midway along protruding into the white central underwing. Immature birds have a pale grey wash on the crown extending to the breast, a less prominent black brow, and a dark grey underwing that lightens with age. Their greyish-green bill has a&#xA0;dark tip; the entire bill&#xA0;turns yellow-orange with age.</p>\n<p>Voice: black-browed mollymawks grunt and cackle when quarrelling over food, and make belligerent two-tone braying calls and vibrating bill movements during displays at their breeding grounds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Campbell black-browed mollymawk is almost identical but has a diagnostic honey-coloured iris (discernible only at close range) and broader dark margins on the underwing. Juveniles of the two species are indistinguishable. Juvenile grey-headed mollymawks are very similar to juvenile black-browed and Campbell black-browed mollymawks, but the juvenile grey-headed mollymawk is usually darker on the head and has a darker bill, with less contrast at the tip. </p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black-browed mollymawks are circumpolar colonial annual breeders at subantarctic islands including Antipodes Islands, Campbell Island and Snares Western Chain in New Zealand, and at Macquarie Island (Australia), Kerguelen and Crozet Islands (<a title=\"French overseas territory\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Southern_and_Antarctic_Lands\">French Southern Lands</a>), South Georgia and Falkland Islands (<a title=\"UK overseas territories\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories\">UK overseas territories</a>) and Ildefonso Islands off southern Chile. After breeding, they disperse widely around the Southern Ocean and into temperate seas in the South Pacific, South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. They are often seen off the New Zealand coast, particularly in Cook Strait and off Kaikoura Peninsula, or following fishing boats, especially in winter. Some birds from Chile spend the non-breeding season off northern New Zealand. Very rarely an individual black-browed mollymawk reaches the northern hemisphere, where they have frequented Atlantic gannet colonies in Scotland and the Faroe Islands (Denmark). Hence, a mollymawk is referred to as a &quot;king gannet&quot; in Faroese.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The estimated global population is 3 million individuals, making it the world&#x2019;s most numerous&#xA0;albatross species.&#xA0;About 70% of the birds breed at the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), so the New Zealand breeding population is tiny in comparison.&#xA0;About 120 pairs breed at Bollons Island in the Antipodes Islands; c.20 pairs breed at Campbell Island, some of which interbreed with the related Campbell black-browed mollymawk;&#xA0;and one&#xA0;pair on Toru Islet, Western Chain, Snares Islands. There are recent indications of an increase in the numbers breeding at the Falkland Islands. Aerial and ground-based surveys in 2010 revealed an increase in population between 2005 and 2010 of at least 4% per year.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The black-browed mollymawk was reclassifed from Endangered to Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List in December 2013 because it was no longer estimated to be undergoing a very rapid population decline. Survey data from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), holding over 70% of the global population, showed population increases during the 2000s and possibly since the 1980s. However, there remains considerable uncertainty over population trends for a significant part of the global population and high levels of mortality are reported from longline and trawl fisheries in the South Atlantic. Birds are also frequently caught in long-line fisheries in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, with mostly juvenile birds caught. This may account for the low recruitment rate at New Zealand colonies. It is reportedly caught less frequently in hoki and squid trawl fisheries. Birds sometimes eat plastic debris at sea, mistaking it for food. When plastic debris is regurgitated and fed to chicks they can die from starvation as a result of a blocked digestive tract. </p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Black-browed mollymawks breed at New Zealand subantarctic islands in colonies on grassy coastal cliffs or boulder slopes, from September to May. On Campbell Island they breed among mixed colonies of Campbell black-browed and grey-headed mollymawks; on Bollons Island they breed in a loose colony with white-capped mollymawks; and on rocky Toru Islet one pair breeds among Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks. Black-browed mollymawks perform aerial displays early in the breeding season. Courtship involves walking and bill-fencing. Black-browed mollymawks form monogamous, long-term pair bonds. A single large&#xA0;white egg with pinkish speckling is laid in September or October. The nest is&#xA0;bowl-shaped with sloping sides made from soil and grass, or guano and fish bones. The 70 day incubation and 130 day chick-rearing period are shared. Chicks are guarded for the first 15-34 days, and&#xA0;fledge in mid-April. The average age of first breeding is 10 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black-browed mollymawks often feed noisily in flocks with other seabirds. On arriving at their nest, they fan&#xA0;their tail, lift their&#xA0;wings, point their&#xA0;bill toward the nest, and bray aggressively. A bird defending its territory cackles<em>,</em> vibrates its&#xA0;bill, exposes an orange skin-stripe on its cheeks, and stretches its head towards the ground. Adults and chicks sometimes squirt foul-smelling oily fluid secreted from their stomach through their mouth, or the whole stomach contents, if threatened at the nest. Campbell Island breeders alternate between short trips to continental shelf areas around the breeding site and long trips to the Polar Front.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black-browed mollymawks mostly feed on fish, squid and krill caught at the sea surface or during shallow dives, often in the company of petrels and other mollymawks and albatrosses. They sometimes follow whales and dolphins, and have been recorded stealing fish from shags. Other prey items, such as seabirds (e.g. small petrels and terns), are taken occasionally either alive or as carrion found floating on the sea surface. Black-browed mollymawks also scavenge long-line baits and discarded fish offal while following fishing vessels, and at marine mammal carcasses found floating at sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-browed_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-browed_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3959\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3959</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/238-black-browed-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/238-black-browed-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Cherel, Y.; Klages, N. 1997.

It is one of the smaller albatrosses, and characterised amongst this group by having an all-yellow-orange bill, and all white body. There is a black triangle around the eyes which contrasts strongly with the otherwise white head and gives the appearance that the bird is frowning. The upper wings are dark, and the underwings are white with broad black edges. The eyes are honey-coloured, which is the main distinguishing feature from the more widespread black-browed mollymawk, which has dark eyes. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Campbell black-browed mollymawk are found throughout the continental shelf area of southern New Zealand waters, and feed on small fish, squid and crustaceans, mainly in water depths less than 200 m. It is commonly found south of Cook Strait, but occurs as far south as 60&#xB0; South, and around East Cape in the autumn to winter. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Campbell black-browed mollymawk is a large white-bodied bird with dark upperwings and tail. The eye has a distinctive &#x2018;black-brow&#x2019; from which the species takes part of its name. The rest of the name refers to its sole breeding location (Campbell Island) and is necessary to distinguish the local birds from the circumpolar black-browed mollymawk. The two differ mainly in their eye colour &#x2013; pale yellow in the Campbell black-browed mollymawk, and black in the black-browed mollymawk. The underwing is white with broad black margins. The bill is a vibrant orange-yellow, the tip may be darker than the sides, and can be reddish. In juvenile birds the eye is dark, there may be a dusky hood or collar, and the bill is greyish-black, lightening progressively to orange along the sides and finally the tip over a period of 2-3 years.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Voice: a range of croaks, wails, throbbing groans, and grunts.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Similar species: the black-browed mollymawk (=albatross) retains a dark iris into adulthood and has a whiter underwing (i.e the black margins are broader in the Campbell Island birds). The Indian Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawk is another small albatross with a white head, but has a much slimmer, more elongated body shape and a proportionally much longer bill which (in adults) is black with a yellow strip along the top. It also has a much whiter underwing. Juvenile grey-headed mollymawks may be indistinguishable from juveniles of the two black-browed mollymawk species, as while the latter are generally paler on the head, all three can pass through a dark-headed stage with an olive-brown bill.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Campbell black-browed mollymawks nest only at Campbell Island and offshore Isle de Jeanette Marie, where they breed on coastal cliffs alongside grey-headed mollymawks, often in mixed colonies. They occur throughout New Zealand seas, mainly south of Cook Strait in summer, and East Cape in autumn. Campbell black-browed mollymawks range widely in Australasian seas, even reaching the Ross Sea during the breeding season (September-May). Vagrants have been recorded north to Vanuatu, New Caledonia and other Pacific islands, but they are very rare in the Indian Ocean, and not known from the South Atlantic. Campbell black-browed mollymawks often follow ships and may spend a day or more keeping close to vessels in their zone, and scavenge actively for fish waste or offal released from vessels. Their feeding habitat is mainly in waters deeper than 200 m. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The numbers of Campbell black-browed mollymawks nesting at Campbell Island have been monitored sporadically since the 1940s, and showed a major decrease in numbers during the 1970s and 1990s. The most recent population estimate was around 21,000 breeding pairs.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Campbell black-browed mollymawk has a secure breeding site with no introduced predators, (although Norway rats and feral cats were formerly present, and may have had some impact). Current threats are likely to result from changes in food availability within the foraging range of the birds, affecting how far they need to fly when feeding chicks. Occasional incidental mortality is noted for the species in longline fishing events, but this is a rare event.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Campbell black-browed mollymawks form long-term monogamous pair-bonds, with shared incubation and chick care. They breed annually, laying the single large (103 x 66 mm) creamy white egg on a pedestal earth nest in September or October, and incubating it for 65-72 days until it hatches in January or February. The chick is fed by regurgitation, and fledges in April-May when 120-125 days old. They typically breed when 10-12 years old, and may live for more than 30 years.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Campbell black-browed mollymawks are solitary at sea, although may raft in small groups. Birds foraged during breeding by both short and long range flights of &gt; 1000 km. The main feeding area, is on the Campbell Plateau, but birds often fly as far as the Polar Front, 1000-1500 km south of Campbell Island. Campbell black-browed mollymawks often forage behind fishing boats, competing aggressively for offal and discards.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Diet at Campbell consisted mainly of fish, in particular southern blue whiting, also squid and crustaceans.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Albatross</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/mollymawkblackbrowed.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/mollymawkblackbrowed.html</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/293-campbell-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/293-campbell-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p align=\"left\">Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 2012.

Their striking black-and-golden-yellow bill and smart black-and-white plumage make them readily identifiable as they scavenge close to fishing vessels. The southern subspecies is unusual among albatrosses in breeding under tall, dense woody vegetation which sometimes requires it to walk up to 100 m inland to reach its nest after landing in open tussock at the forest edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk is one of the smallest of the albatrosses. It is black across the upperwings, with a white lower back and rump and black tip to the tail. The underparts are white with a clear-cut broad black leading edge and narrow black trailing edge under the wing. The light-grey neck and throat contrast with the silvery-grey crown. The bill is black with golden-yellow top and bottom plates.</p>\n<p>The two subspecies are separated by bill size and colour and head plumage. Southern Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk has a silvery-white forehead with black extending over about 70% of the sides of the bill. Northern Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk has a silvery-grey forehead with black extending over about 80% of the sides of the bill. In addition, the bill of northern Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk is more robust (longer and deeper) than that of the southern Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk.</p>\n<p>Voice: Buller&#x2019;s mollymawks are usually silent at sea, though may give harsh croaking when squabbling for food. They utter a variety of brays, croaks and wails during courtship.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the only similar species is the grey-headed mollymawk, which has more extensive black on the leading edge of the underwing than in Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk. Also, it has a light-grey head, throat, neck and mantle that appear darker than in Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk, particularly on the forehead and crown. Finally, the bill is shorter and has more extensive black on the sides than in either subspecies of Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The southern subspecies breeds on the Snares Islands and the Solander Islands, with many of the nests under dense woody vegetation such as <em>Olearia lyalli, Brachyglottis</em> <em>stewartiae </em>and <em>Hebe elliptica. </em>During the breeding season it is commonly found in seas off the South Island and off south-eastern Australia, less often as far south as Macquarie Island and as far north as the Kermadec Islands. One was found ashore at Middle Sister Island, Chatham Islands. The northern subspecies breeds mainly in open areas on the Sisters and Forty-Fours, Chatham Islands, with a small population on Rosemary Rock, Three Kings Islands. It ranges mainly off the Chatham Islands and eastern North Island, but has been recorded in subantarctic seas. After breeding both subspecies migrate to the seas off Peru and Chile.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Counts of the number of breeding pairs of southern Buller&#x2019;s mollymawks estimated the total breeding population at 13,625 breeding pairs in 2002. This comprised an estimated 8,713 breeding pairs on The Snares and 4,912 breeding pairs at the Solander Islands. There are no recent estimates of the numbers of northern Buller&#x2019;s mollymawks, but in the 1970s there were an estimated 16,000 breeding pairs on the Forty-Fours and 1,500 breeding pairs on Big Sister. An estimated 630-670 pairs were breeding on Little sister in 1994-96. On Rosemary Rock, 13 occupied nests were recorded in 1985. Thus, the combined total population of the two subspecies is about 32,000 breeding pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>All breeding sites are free from mammalian predators, although an expanding New Zealand fur seal population at the Solander Islands may be affecting breeding success of those birds breeding on the lower slopes. Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk is a common albatross species observed killed in the New Zealand fisheries, with demersal longliners and trawling operations responsible for the majority of mortalities.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Colonies can be densely packed or loose. Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk are monogamous with shared incubation and chick care. The nest is a pedestal of mud, guano and vegetation accumulated from the immediate vicinity, and is used and added to year after year. The single large (104 x 64 mm) white egg is laid in October-November (northern subspecies) or January-February (southern subspecies) and hatches after 68-72 days. Chicks on the Snares Islands fledge when about 167 days old, mainly in August and September, with stragglers into October. Young are independent at fledging; they begin breeding when about 12 years old, and can live more than 45 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>As a typical albatross, Buller&#x2019;s mollymawks have perfected soaring flight. In strong winds they wheel effortlessly on their long, narrow, stiffly held wings. They use their webbed feet for swimming and as rudders when coming in to land. Their strongly hooked bills are used to grasp prey whilst the sharp edges of the upper mandible are used to slice it into manageable portions. However, albatrosses have a great capacity to extend the throat, and so swallow large pieces of food.</p>\n<p>At their breeding colonies Buller&#x2019;s mollymawks use an elaborate series of displays and calls to maintain their pair bond and to defend their nest pedestal. They are annual breeders that usually return to the same nest site year after year with the same partner. After breeding the colonies are deserted and the birds migrate across the Pacific to seas off Chile and Peru. Banding shows that 92-97% of adults survive from one year to the next. The oldest banded bird was estimated to be at least 54 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Buller&#x2019;s mollymawks mainly eat fish, squid, krill, salps and offal from fishing vessels taken from the surface. They rarely plunge or dive for food.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buller&apos;s_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buller&apos;s_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30006\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30006</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/292-buller-s-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/292-buller-s-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><a title=\" An expedition to Solander Island &#x2013; Te Papa Channel\" href=\"http://channel.tepapa.govt.nz/gallery/kingdom-of-the-birds-an-expedition-to-solander-island/\">Kingdom of the Birds: An expedition to Solander Island &#x2013; Te Papa Channel</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Francis, R.I.C.C.; Sagar, P.M. 2012.

It regularly occurs further north also, and across the Tasman Sea. The largest of the mollymawks, its main breeding grounds are in the Auckland Islands (especially Disappointment Island), with a second subspecies breeding on islands off Tasmania and ranging into the Tasman Sea and occasionally to New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The white-capped mollymawk is a typical medium-sized albatross. It is black across the upperwings, with a white lower back and rump and black tip to the tail. The underparts are white, with narrow black borders under the wing and a small black notch in the &#x201C;armpit&#x201D; at the base of the leading edge of the wing. The head and neck are white, with a small dark patch in front of the eyes and a light wash of grey on the cheeks. The bill is blue-grey on the sides with a yellowish tip&#xA0;and basep. Juveniles fledge with an olive-grey bill, darker at the tip. This gets paler with age from the base, so that subadults appear like adults but with a dark tip to both mandibles (c.f. adult Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawk, with a dark tip to the lower mandible). More than 90% of breeding adults of the New Zealand subspecies retain a dark spot&#xA0;near the tip of the lower mandible (though much less extensive than in Salvin&apos;s mollymawk). At-sea separation of the two subspecies is difficult and requires close scrutiny to determine the presence of yellow at the upper base of the bill (indicating Tasmanian mollymawk). In the hand 84% of specimens may be separated by taking a range of wing chord, maximum head width, and two bill measurements.</p>\n<p>Voice: white-capped mollymawk are usually silent at sea, though may give harsh croaking when squabbling for food. They utter a variety of brays, croaks and wails during courtship.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawk is closely related, and has an extensive pale grey head, throat and nape; the bill is grey-green, with a paler top and bottom and a black spot at the tip of the lower mandible.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>During the breeding season (November-June) New Zealand white-capped mollymawks occur throughout coastal New Zealand, especially from Cook Strait south, and extends across the Tasman Sea to south-east Australian waters. After breeding most birds remain in Australasian waters, but about 20% of adults migrate across the Indian Ocean to seas off South Africa and Namibia; it occurs as a vagrant in the South Atlantic. The Tasmanian mollymawk breeds on three islands off Tasmania (Albatross Island, Mewstone and Pedra Blanca) and apparently rarely crosses the Tasman Sea.&#xA0;A banded bird of the Australian subspecies was recovered dead at Waikato River mouth in July 1989, at age 2 years-old, and an adult was photographed&#xA0;in Cook Strait in May 2016&#xA0;(the only accepted New Zealand records).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand white-capped mollymawk breeds on Disappointment, Auckland and Adams Island in the Auckland Islands group, Bollons Island at the Antipodes Islands, and occasionally on the Forty-Fours in the Chatham Islands. By far the largest numbers breed on Disappointment Island where some 91,000 pairs breed annually. Estimates from aerial photographs taken annually at all the Auckland Islands breeding sites during 2006-2010 ranged from 75,000 to 117,000 breeding pairs annually. However, the population is largely a biennial breeder, and so the total population will be somewhat larger then these annual estimates.&#xA0;About 20 pairs breed at Bollons Island and up to 3 pairs at the Forty-Fours.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>With the exception of the main Auckland Island all the white-capped mollymawk breeding sites are free of introduced mammalian predators. On Auckland Island feral pigs have largely restricted successful breeding to inaccessible nesting areas on steep cliffs. Feral cats are also thought to kill chicks on Auckland Island. Fisheries bycatch is the main threat to adult white-capped mollymawks. It was the most common albatross species observed killed in major New Zealand trawl fisheries 2004-2007.&#xA0;However, most significant mortality occurs in the seas off southern Africa, where an estimated 7,000-11,000 were killed annually by the South African pelagic longline fishery alone. Additionally, an estimated 7,700 &#x201C;shy&#x201D; type albatrosses were killed annually in the South African trawl fishery.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>White-capped mollymawks breed in large, densely packed colonies. They are monogamous with shared incubation and chick care. The nest is a pedestal of mud, guano and vegetation accumulated from the immediate vicinity, and used and added to year after year. The single large (106 x 71 mm) white egg is laid from early November to December. Incubation probably 65-75 days; chicks probably fledge at about 115-130 days and are independent at fledging, in June-August.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>As a typical albatross, white-capped mollymawks have perfected soaring flight.

They are mostly biennial breeders, and so do not breed in the year following successfully rearing a chick. However, during this year they may return to the breeding colony to maintain their nest site and maintain their bond with the same partner.&#xA0; After breeding the colonies are deserted and most birds spend the intervening time in Australasian waters, especially the Tasman Sea.

It is striking in appearance, with a dark grey head and bright yellow bill. Endemic to the Chatham Islands, the entire population breeds on The Pyramid, an isolated, almost inaccessible rock stack located south of Pitt Island in the South Pacific Ocean. Truly a pelagic species they spend most of their life at sea only returning to land to breed.</p>\n<p>The population is stable but vulnerable to severe storm events. Small numbers are caught as bycatch in domestic longline fisheries in New Zealand. However, they are vulnerable to longline fisheries off the coasts of Peru and Chile, where they migrate to outside the breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island mollymawk is an endemic medium-sized albatross from the Chatham Islands. Adults have a dark-grey head and neck, with white behind the eye and a thick black line in front of the eye extending towards the bill. The upperwings and back are blackish-brown, and the tail dark grey. The underparts and rump are white, and the underwings are white with a thin black edge (slightly thicker on leading edge) and a small black patch where the leading edge of the wing meets the body, and dark grey to black primaries. The bill is deep yellow with a black lower mandible tip. The legs and feet are light grey-flesh coloured. Immature Chatham Island mollymawks have a lighter grey head, variable amounts of grey on the underwing and undertail, and a yellowish-black bill with a black tip. Juveniles are similar to immature, but with a dark-grey bill with a black tip. Chicks have all light grey down and a black bill.</p>\n<p>Voice: Chatham Island mollymawks are usually quiet at sea. They have a series of calls associated with breeding and territorial defence at colonies: bill clacking, harsh croaks and braying followed by <em>aka aka aka</em> calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Adult Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks have a lighter grey head with a greyish-yellow bill (also with a dark tip to the lower mandible). Juveniles of Chatham Island, Salvin&#x2019;s and Buller&#x2019;s mollymawks are all similar, but are rarely seen in New Zealand waters, as all three migrate to seas off Chile and Peru after fledging. Buller&#x2019;s mollymawk is smaller, with a less robust bill. Chatham Island mollymawk juveniles have the darkest &#x2018;hood&#x2019;, and generally show some yellow at the base of the bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island mollymawk is a true pelagic species only returning to land to breed. The only breeding location is the isolated windswept 1.7 hectare rock stack, The Pyramid, located at the southern end of the Chatham Islands. One pair has attempted to breed on Western Chain, Snares Island. During the breeding season, Chatham Island mollymawks are commonly seen at sea around The Pyramid and the southern Chatham Islands and occasionally at sea around the eastern New Zealand coastline. They migrate to coastal waters off Chile and Peru outside their breeding season. There are records of vagrant Chatham Island mollymawks from eastern Australia, Tasmania and southern Africa.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island mollymawk has a stable annual population of about 5300 occupied nests on The Pyramid (based on surveys counting nest sites 1999-2010).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>With only one breeding population, the Chatham Island mollymawk is vulnerable to severe storm events during the breeding season, which can affect breeding success and adult survival. Outside the breeding season such events can remove vegetation and the small amount of soil used for nest construction.</p>\n<p>There is a history of occasional harvesting of Chatham Island mollymawks by Moriori and other settlers on the Chatham Islands. Although they do not normally follow fishing vessels, small numbers have been reported as bycatch in domestic longline fisheries in New Zealand. Chatham Island mollymawks are at greatest risk during the non-breeding season, from artisanal longline fisheries off the west coast of South America.</p>\n<p>The Chatham Island mollymawk is currently listed as Naturally Uncommon by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and Vulnerable by the IUCN.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island mollymawks breed in a single colony on The Pyramid, Chatham Islands. They are monogamous, annual breeders, with shared incubation and chick rearing. The single large (102 x 66 mm) whitish egg is laid on a nest pedestal, built of soil, guano, vegetation and occasionally bone that can reach up to 1m in height. Adults return to the colony in August, eggs are laid from mid September to late October, with incubation taking 68-72 days. Chicks hatch in November to December and fledge from March to May, when 120-140 days old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island mollymawks nests are built on rocky ledges and steep slopes, in close proximity, occupying almost all available space on The Pyramid. The steep slopes allow adults to land on or by their nest without disturbing other nesting birds. However, if intruders come too close to occupied nests the adults will act aggressively by biting, bill clacking or vomiting. Chicks respond to intruders by biting, bill clacking and regurgitating stomach oil.</p>\n<p>Adult bonding and mating behaviour includes intricate pair displays and dances with raised heads, bowing and bobbing, braying calls followed by croak calls, dual bill clacking and rubbing, tail fanning, and mutual preening. Bonded pairs at nests during incubation and guard-stage shift changeovers display bray calls, dual bill clacking and rubbing, and mutual preening as mate recognition.</p>\n<p>The earliest juveniles return to The Pyramid aged four years, with first breeding at seven years of age, but predominantly later with a peak at eleven years.</p>\n<p>Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks have also been recorded on The Pyramid, where they interact with Chatham Island mollymawks, with one mixed species pair recorded on a nest together, caring for a chick.</p>\n<p>At sea Chatham Island mollymawks are generally solitary and don&#x2019;t tend to follow ships. They form rafts up to several hundred individuals in washing flocks, offshore from The Pyramid.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island mollymawks are generally surface feeders, but will shallow dive for food. They are known to feed on fish, squid and krill.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3963\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3963</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/294-chatham-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/294-chatham-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>De Roy, T.; Jones, M.; Fitter, J. 2008. <em>Albatross: their world, their ways</em>.

Common pheasants were among the first to be released, in Wellington, Canterbury, Otago and Auckland from 1842-1877. They are established throughout open country in the North Island, with local populations topped up by ongoing releases by Fish &amp; Game Councils and private breeders. Numbers are lower in the South Island. Hunting of pheasants and other game birds in New Zealand is managed by Fish &amp; Game New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The common pheasant is the largest introduced upland gamebird species established in New Zealand, weighing up to 1.5 kilograms. The male is larger than the female and much more brightly coloured. The most prominent features of the male are its red facial wattle, iridescent blue-green head and neck feathers, distinctive white collar, and long, barred tail feather. The body feathers are red and brown with intricate white margins and black barring. The female is much smaller with a short tail and subtly marked brown feathers with much finer black barring.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: the male has a distinctive loud crow &#x2018;<em>kok-kok&#x2019;</em>. When flushed, the male utters a loud throaty <em>korrrk</em> alarm call.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: adult female and immature common pheasants may resemble helmeted guineafowl but lack the bony casque on the head and white-spotted grey plumage. They may also resemble weka and adult female and immature wild turkeys but are distinguished by having long tapering tail feathers and paler brown plumage. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pheasants are most abundant in the northern and western regions of the North Island. In the South Island, it is mainly found in the drier areas of Canterbury and Nelson. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In New Zealand, common pheasants inhabit a wide variety of open habitats, including grasslands, arable and pastural farmland, exotic forestry, deciduous woodland, coastal shrubland and road verges. They have a strong association with areas where ink weed is common.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand pheasant population is estimated at 250,000 birds, with about 50,000 males shot each year during the winter game-hunting season. Its numbers are augmented through releases of captive-reared birds. Pheasant numbers increased rapidly after their release, but plummeted in the 1890s following the release of ferrets and stoats and widespread laying of poisoned grain, both being measures implemented to control populations of introduced rabbits. Pheasant populations have never fully recovered.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pheasants are not recognised as having any significant economic or conservation impacts beyond being a gamebird, with flow-on benefits to suppliers of hunting equipment and licenses. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Common pheasants are solitary outside the breeding season. Males are polygamous, mating with a number of females and taking no part in nest building or incubation. The main breeding season is from October to December, but eggs have been found from July to March. The nest is a bowl-shaped indentation in grass, well hidden among vegetation. The average clutch size is 9 with a range of 7-15. Incubation takes 23-28 days; the chicks leave the nest when dry and are able to fly short distances after 12 days. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pheasants stay close to vegetation, seeking cover when disturbed. They are wary and have good eye-sight, and so provide few opportunities to observe behaviour other than threat response. When disturbed at close range, they erupt into vertical flight and fly low and swiftly until pitching back into cover. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food and feeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Common pheasants are omnivorous, feeding on foliage, seeds, grains, berries and invertebrates. Chicks mainly consume insects. Adults can dig in the ground with their beak and claws up to a depth of 8 cm.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks &#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Pheasant\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Pheasant</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/westcoast/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/pheasants/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/westcoast/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/upland-game-birds/pheasants/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Falla, R.A.; Sibson, R.B.; Turbott, E.G. 1966. <em>A field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Other distress and warning calls given throughout the year. Clucking calls are used by females with young and when pointing out food.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Peafowl have been released into the wild many times, mainly through benign neglect of birds kept for display. Peafowl are held on many lifestyle properties, and have become feral in the upper North Island, especially Northland, Auckland, East Cape and mid Hawkes Bay. The largest feral populations are in wooded lowlands and coastal farmland including the upper Wanganui River catchment, northern Mahia Peninsula and pine forests of the South Head of Kaipara Harbour. They are also present in isolated locations in Nelson, Marlborough and Canterbury. Absent from Stewart Island. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No population estimates. Peafowl are generally recorded in small mixed-sex groups of less than 10 birds in the pre-breeding season. They congregate in larger flocks during February-August. Up to 100 birds were in one field at Orere Point, Firth of Thames in April 2011, and more than 100 near Otane, central Hawke&apos;s Bay in June 2016. Other large flocks included 17 at Whakapirau, North Kaipara, and 35 at Waipu Caves, Northland. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tame birds are often killed by dogs. Peahens are not attentive mothers, and many chicks are taken by predators. Feral population easily controlled by hunting. When disturbed, peafowl typically run downhill and then fly. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Breeding season late August to early January. Displays end 7-10 days before males moult their train of tail coverts. Females lay in bare scrapes concealed within long grass, and incubate eggs and raise young on their own. Clutch size is typically 4-6 eggs. Incubation takes 28-30 days and chicks can stay with their mother for more than a year. In wild populations, clutches appear to be deserted when 1-2 young are hatched. Females with young remain separate from flocks, until the young are 4 months old. Chicks forage for themselves with the peahen pointing at food with her bill. A single brood is raised per annum. Males take 6 years to be fully mature.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wild peafowl descend from roost trees within the first 2 hours of dawn, and ascend to their roosts about half an hour after sunset. They feed most actively in the early morning and during the last two hours of daylight. Males arrive quickly at display sites during the breeding season and seldom leave them until mid afternoon. Males display in expanded lek (i.e. several males display out of view but in vocal contact with each other) and are visited by groups of females. Outside the breeding season males flock together with females. Males tend to roost alone or in groups. Young males leave roost sites of females and young to roost with other males or alone at the end of their second year. Females and young less than 4 months old roost separately from other peafowl.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Peafowl are omnivorous, taking grains, seeds and fleshy fruits, flowers, and invertebrates, especially cicadas and crickets. They peck at objects and climb trees to access fruits and flowers. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Beauchamp, A.

They may also resemble adult female and immature common pheasants but have darker plumage and lack long tapering tail feathers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Turkeys were released into the wild or escaped from farmyards many times from the 1860s to the present. The earliest release recorded was on Kawau Island in the 1860s, and turkeys were feral in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay by 1894. Their feral range has expanded since the 1970s, and they are now found in rough farmland with scattered trees throughout much of lowland North Island, the Marlborough Sounds, and at scattered eastern locations in the South Island. Turkeys are also feral on some large farmed islands including Waiheke and&#xA0;Great Barrier Islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No population estimates. Feral turkeys are sparsely distributed, occurring in groups of tens of individuals from late summer to late winter. In the breeding season, smaller groups form comprising a dominant male and 4 - 5 females. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Many are killed by dogs. Chicks are likely to be taken by cats, ferrets, pukeko and swamp harriers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Males defend a harem of females during the breeding season. The female does all the incubation and chick-rearing, clucking to maintain contact with her brood. There is no information on breeding success from wild New Zealand populations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wild turkeys are wary and do not allow close approach. They feed in small flocks during the day, and roost on fence posts and in trees at night. Turkeys are more gregarious outside the breeding season, with females and young males forming larger flocks. Older males are often solitary.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Turkeys are mainly herbivorous, eating seeds and fruits plus a few ground-dwelling invertebrates. Young chicks feed mainly on insects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Druett, J. 1983. <em>Exotic intruders: the introduction of plants and animals into New Zealand</em>.

It is the only whistling duck to have been observed in New Zealand, and is typically&#xA0;encountered&#xA0;in flocks. Tree ducks fly with their head lower than their back and with conspicuously trailing legs, and their noisy wingbeats making a whistling sound.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Whistling ducks stand erect and goose-like but are much smaller and slimmer than geese or shelducks. The plumed whistling-duck is predominantly pale fawn or buff with pale chestnut sides. It has very prominent, long and pale yellow flank feathers extending up almost onto the back. The bill is pink with dark freckles, and the legs and feet pale pink. The sexes are alike and of similar size.</p>\n<p>Voice: plumed whistling-ducks give loud high-pitched whistles, and there is constant twittering within flocks.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the plumed whistling-duck is distinguished from the wandering whistling-duck by its generally pale colouration (the wandering whistling-duck has dark back, legs and crown) and its prominent pale yellow lanceolate flank feathers. Note that the wandering whistling-duck has yet to be recorded in New Zealand and so is not featured on New Zealand Birds Online.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>Plumed whistling-ducks occur across northern Australia, throughout Queensland and into New South Wales, in the upper Darling River basin and Murray &amp; Murrumbidgee catchments. Formerly considered of rare occurrence in New Zealand (approx. 8 times during the 20th century), small flocks have occurred at least&#xA0;7 times since 2000. Most sightings have been of small flocks (maximum 14 birds) at the western edge of New Zealand, but birds have reached Hawke&#x2019;s Bay (Anderson Park, Napier) and Chatham Island (2 different flocks of 3, both in 2011). The 3 Napier birds soon reduced to 2,&#xA0;which were both still present in February 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Plumed whistling-ducks are grassland grazers that feed much like a goose, on short grass swards. They will sometimes dabble in shallow water. They are not strongly associated with water, but tend to roost alongside water on bare ground. Roosting sites&#xA0;are often&#xA0;referred to as &#x201C;camps&#x201D;. They generally avoid coastal or tidal areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Plumed whistling-ducks are very common in northern Australia, with some population estimates reaching 1 million birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Nests are situated solitarily on the ground, usually in long grass. The 8-14 eggs are incubated by both sexes, for about 28 days. Both adults guard the ducklings until they fledge at about 56-65 days old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Plumed whistling-ducks are highly gregarious and form large communal feeding and roosting flocks. However, adults appear to form long-term pair bonds, with partners remaining in constant contact within the flocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumed_Whistling_Duck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumed_Whistling_Duck</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Frith, H.J. 1977. <em>Waterfowl in Australia</em>.

According to Acclimatisation Society records, there were four releases to the following regions; Canterbury (1866), Otago (1868-69), Auckland (1869, by Sir George Grey, and again in 1871). The mute swan is monotypic with no subspecies. Its closest relative is the Australasian black swan.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The mute swan is a large, entirely white swan. There is no sexual dimorphism in plumage, but females are smaller. In striking comparison to the white body plumage are the bright orange-red bill and wedge-like black mask and knob of the upper mandible. The mask extends back to a point in front of the eye. The bill knob is larger in the male. The mute swan is one of the largest flying birds and it limits its flying to migration and movement between suitable habitat. It spends most of its time floating on the water surface where it uses its long neck to feed on submerged water plants. Some young cygnets are born with white down, but the most common colours range from grey to buff.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The natural range for the mute swan is throughout northern Eurasia to eastern Europe. It also extends into temperate areas of Asia. It migrates through northern Europe and occasionally to North Africa and the Mediterranean. Introduced to the USA, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand, wild mute swans are found in Canterbury and Hawkes Bay, with a few other small semi-feral populations near where they have been released. Its preferred habitat is lakes and ponds of still and slow moving water. They feed on the vegetation of water margins and shallow lake beds. Mute swans build large raised nests in shallow water close to the margins of lakes and ponds. They have a strong pair bond and reuse nests. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The mute swan has a wide distribution in the northern hemisphere, with the largest breeding populations in the countries of the former Soviet Union (350,000 birds), Volga Delta (11,000 pairs), United Kingdom (22,000 birds) and Germany (8,000 pairs). Introduced mute swans bred rapidly in the USA and are now considered an invasive species. Although very small, wild populations have established in New Zealand at Lake Ellesmere (80 birds) and Hawkes Bay (20 birds). Some semi-feral populations exist in municipal gardens such as Virginia Lake, Whanganui.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Until 2010, mute swans had absolute protection under the Wildlife Act 1953. This total protection has now been lifted. It can now be culled or held in captivity at the discretion of the Minister of Conservation. However, there have been no incidences of populations becoming invasive or destructive as in the USA. The contrary situation exists with the mute swan populations in New Zealand declining owing to predation and outbreaks of botulism.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_Swan\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_Swan</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">del Hoyo, J., <em>et al., </em>(ed). 1992. <em>Handbook of the birds of the world</em>. 1.

The bill is a bright red with a terminal white band, the eyes are red, and the legs are dark grey. Both sexes are alike, but the female is noticeably smaller than the male. Cygnets are grey with a black bill, and newly-fledged young are dull greyish-brown with a brown eye. On land swans walk slowly and are ungainly. In flight, the birds labour and their conspicuous white flight feathers elicit a whistling sound. </p>\n<p>Voice: generally described as &#x201C;a musical bugling&#x201D; given primarily as a contact call between mates and often accompanied by flicking &#xA0;head movements. Hisses when defending young or when threatening.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the only other swan in New Zealand is the larger and all white mute swan, which is very rare.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are widely scattered throughout New Zealand and on the Chatham Islands. Occurs on most lakes and larger constructed ponds, and also on estuaries, which are an important feeding and moulting habitat. Gathers in large flocks on selected estuaries (e.g., Awarua Bay, Farewell Spit, Tauranga Harbour, Kaipara Harbour) in January&#x2013;February to moult, at which time the birds are flightless.&#xA0; </p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are common, with a national population of about 50,000 (2011). Formerly much more numerous but the widespread loss of aquatic plants, their preferred foods, from most lowland lakes has greatly reduced their numbers and made those swans still present more reliant on lakeside land plants and grasses.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Previously identified as being structured into regional populations, with key breeding lakes and associated estuarine areas for feeding and moulting for each. However, as a consequence of the eutrophication of most lowland lakes, this structure may have broken down and swans may be more dispersive. </p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are a legal gamebird in most parts of New Zealand with up to 7,000 shot annually (2011). They are unprotected on Chatham Island, where eggs are also gathered periodically to effect population control. Some lakeside farmers are intolerant to swans grazing their pastures, especially in winter, and require Fish &amp; Game Councils to harass the swans or cull their numbers.&#xA0; </p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans breed only on freshwaters. However, even at major breeding sites, the majority of birds present seem not to participate. Most breeding occurs as monogamous territorial pairs defending all or part of a pond, small lake or lake edge. Formerly there were extensive nesting in colonies on large lakes with profuse lake-bed aquatic plant beds and with fluctuating water levels (e.g., Lakes Ellesmere, Whangape and Wairarapa) but this habit is now rare primarily because most lowland lakes are eutrophic and dominated by algal blooms. Nesting may commence in July with a large mound of vegetation being accumulated at a secluded site on the water&#x2019;s edge.&#xA0;On average 5-6 pale green eggs are laid and incubated for about 36 days mostly, but not exclusively, by the female. Young fledge after about 120 days, but families may remain together for several months. Occasionally, and where lake food is plentiful, a pair may nest again in late summer and raise a second brood.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Colonial nesting generally occurs later in the year (September&#x2013;November) and coincides with the post-winter decline in water levels. There is considerable mating promiscuity, and large clutches (7-14 eggs) result from females laying in unattended nests. Some creching of young occurs where lake food is abundant.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are graceful, slow swimmers which, even when in flocks, seem to be associated in pairs. The larger male raises its elaborately crinkled upper wing feathers (coverts and tertials) in sexual and threat displays. Both members of a pair perform elaborate greeting displays to each involving head flicks and trumpeting calls. A substantial proportion of the total population remains dispersed as flocks on fresh and estuarine waters throughout the year, and the ages of these birds and of social structures in the flocks remains unknown. </p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black swans are entirely herbivorous,&#xA0;preferring submerged freshwater plants such as <em>Egeria, Elodea, Potamogeton </em>and<em> Myriophyllum, </em>and<em> Ruppia</em> in brackish waters. When lakes levels are high and submerged plants unreachable, or when submerged plants are sparse, swans will graze lakeside pastures onto which they can swim or walk. In estuaries, the main food is <em>Zostera. </em>However they require freshwater and they favour <em>Zostera</em> beds in close proximity to incoming streams or drains or estuarine channels carrying strong freshwater flows at low tide. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/wellington/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/waterfowl-ducks-and-swans/other-game-waterfowl/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/wellington/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/waterfowl-ducks-and-swans/other-game-waterfowl/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kear, J.

Six birds released in 1914-15 at Lakes Hawea and Wanaka resulted in a small breeding population that persisted until 1946. Birds recorded elsewhere during or soon after that &#x2013; Lake Thompson (1934), Loch Maree (March 1947) and Lake Hankinson (June 1947) &#x2013; may have come from this population.&#xA0;This species does not normally fly long distances in Australia, and it is unknown if any New Zealand birds are true vagrants from across the Tasman. Most recent records are almost certainly released or escaped captive birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Cape Barren goose is a large, grey goose with a comparatively small head and a short black bill largely obscured by a prominent lime-yellow cere that surrounds the large nares. The forehead and crown are whiter than the rest of the grey head and neck, this is more apparent in adult birds. Both the upper- and under-parts are grey with a slight brown wash. Paler margins to the breast and back feathers create a faint scaly effect. The tail and both sets of tail coverts are black. The upper wing coverts each have a dark grey spot near their tips, showing up as three lines of small spots on the closed wing. Spots on the scapulars are larger and browner; these are smaller in immature birds. The flight feathers are grey with black tips, the extent of which increases towards the outer primaries where it covers the distal half of the feathers. The iris is honey coloured, and the legs are deep pink with black feet, giving the impression that the bird has been walking in mud. Goslings are strongly patterned black and white, including having a black mask.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a rasping two-note call that rises and falls rhythmically, often given by birds when flying. Also has a deep, double-note, pig-like grunt, hence its colloquial name &#x2018;pig goose&#x2019;.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since 1988, a small population of liberated birds has become established at St Anne&#x2019;s Lagoon / Mata Kopae in North Canterbury, where up to 18 birds have been recorded together. Individual and pairs of birds are also intermittently recorded around Christchurch (Lake Ellesmere, Travis wetland, Waipara and Amberley lagoons, wetlands and pastures along the Cam River), south to Timaru; these birds are probably escapees from Peacock Springs wildlife park, which has a captive population. Some of these feral birds have been recorded breeding. A small population in the South Kaipara Harbour region, north of Helensville, probably also originates from liberated birds, as has a pair near Hokitika. Incidental records (Takaka, 1998; Wanganui and Waikanae, 1987-1988; Waikanae-Paraparaumu, 2001-2002; Owaka, 2004; Kaikoura, 2005, 2009; near Kaitaia, 2006; Cape Reinga, 2009; Mowhanau Beach, 2010, 2012; Catlins River, 2011; and Lake Hood, near Ashburton, 2011) are also most likely to be escapees from private waterfowl collections.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cape Barren geese are almost wholly terrestrial, inhabiting open grassland, including planted pastures, on the fringes of wetlands; they avoid scrub-encroached grasslands. Some birds also visit the coast, including a pair seen flying from Stephenson Island (Mahinepua) in early 2011, and 7 birds seen on a headland there in late 2012. This raises the possibility of a small breeding population becoming established in a similar environment to that in which they breed in Australia: small offshore islets in the Bass Strait, and the Recherche Archipelago, Western Australia.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The size of the New Zealand Cape Barren goose population is not known but probably small. Maximum numbers reported from a site are 18 (St Anne&#x2019;s Lagoon / Mata Kopae), but three-quarters of all sightings are of individuals or pairs. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geese generally can be destructive in newly sown croplands, and their droppings can foul pastures, but the extent of impact depends on the number of birds. Given this species&#x2019; small population, patchy distribution and apparently limited capacity to establish and spread, it is unlikely to be causing any significant economic or ecological impacts.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Monogamous; pairs generally mate for life. Only a few breeding records are known from New Zealand, all of pairs with young goslings. Nesting takes place in late winter, with goslings being seen in early spring. In Australia, the nests are placed beneath bushes or in large grass tussocks, always in positions where the birds have a good view. Nests are built-up grass-lined hollows filled with grey down that covers the eggs when the female leaves the nest. Only the female incubates, but both parents brood small goslings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mainly terrestrial, in Australia grazing on short grassland, pastures, and coastal fringes. Calls and threat displays similar to those of other geese. In this, birds lift their folded wings repeatedly, stretching out and pumping their necks vigorously, the intensity rising with increasing levels of aggression. On attack, a bird either rushes forward with the head held out and low, or runs upright with wings spread. After mating, a pair performs a &#x2018;triumph ceremony&#x2019;, facing each other while raising and lowering their heads on outstretched necks, calling loudly. The same display is given after aggressive encounters with other birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cape Barren geese graze green grass, legumes and other herbs. They also strip seed heads, and in captivity will feed on grain scattered on the ground. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Barren_Goose\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Barren_Goose</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Over the years geese have been bred and kept not just for the meat, fat, eggs and down they provide, but for controlling weeds, fighting and guard duty as well. The first birds of any kind introduced into New Zealand were five geese brought from South Africa by Captain Cook and set free at Goose Cove in Dusky Sound. This was not successful and there were just a few attempts by acclimatisation societies to establish them too. The birds seen in the wild throughout New Zealand have probably originated from stray farmyard geese that are often managed by benign neglect. It is difficult to tell which geese on farms and parks are truly wild, and which are more or less domestic, but some flocks are clearly independent of people.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feral geese are descended from wild greylag geese of Eurasia. They are large geese; males are entirely white and females have large greyish brown patches, especially on the lower breast and sides and on the neck. On the sides of the upper part of the neck the feathers are arranged into a series of fine grooves. The bill is deep at the base and, along with the feet, usually orange but may be pinkish. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The feet are placed well forward and they walk easily. They are heavier at the hind end than Canada geese and have a more upright stance. On the water the rear end sits much higher and the tail is more angled, about 45&#xB0; from the water. Young goslings are downy and yellow, browner above and paler below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a loud and resonant slightly buzzing &#x201C;honk&#x201D;. Males may also hiss in defence and aggression.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: male feral geese are much smaller than adult mute swans, and have a shorter, thicker neck and more compact body. Pale brown juvenile mute swans are equally large, similar in shape and uniformly coloured. Feral geese are more heavily built than Canada geese, and females do not have the black head and neck nor white cheek patch that is characteristic of Canada geese. The dove-grey Cape Barren goose is smaller, and has a largely yellowish-green bill and black flight feathers. A white male goose in flight may also resemble a royal spoonbill at a distance as both fly with their necks outstretched, but geese lack the obvious large black bill of spoonbills.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feral greylag geese are widespread in both main islands but are largely absent from Fiordland and Westland south of Greymouth. They are also common on the Chatham Islands. Feral geese are usually seen in urban parks and on pasture grass or adjacent ponds in farmland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No attempt has been made to assess the population of feral geese in New Zealand and it would be difficult to differentiate truly feral geese from free-ranging domesticated birds. The population is likely to be in the low thousands. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geese defecate copiously and may foul pasture making it unfit as food for farm animals. However, flocks are usually controlled to a level where this is not important. In urban parks aggressive male geese may threaten, chase and even bite people.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is no published information on the breeding of feral greylag geese in New Zealand. They nest on the ground, often near water, under cover such as long grass and willows.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geese are sociable, resting and feeding in flocks. Although favoured as food in some countries they are not esteemed in New Zealand, and so the birds are not often hunted and therefore moderately tame.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feral greylag geese graze on foliage and seeds of pasture grasses and herbs often well away from water. Foods include grain, roots and bulbs, a few insects and snails.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylag_Goose\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylag_Goose</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

One species of stint &#x2013; the red-necked &#x2013; is an annual migrant to New Zealand, and Lake Ellesmere is the single most important New Zealand site for these diminutive waders. Occasionally a different species of stint arrives with these birds, providing a challenge for local birdwatchers, as the stints (or &#x2018;peeps&#x2019;) includes several very similar species pairs. One such pair is the &#x2018;yellow-legged&#x2019; stints: the long-toed stint from Eurasia and the least sandpiper from America. Each has been recorded from New Zealand on one or two occasions, but there are several additional records of stints with yellow legs from New Zealand that were not able to be assigned to species. The two accepted records of long-toed stints were birds at Lake Ellesmere in August-September 1997 and December 2000. About 200 long-toed stints reach Australia each year.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The long-toed stint is a tiny delicate wader with pale yellow-green legs. Its markings are very like a miniature sharp-tailed sandpiper, with a rufous cap, prominent pale supercilium, variegated rufous, black and buff back and wings, speckled breast and white underparts.</p>\n<p>Voice&#xA0; a soft rippling brrt-chrrup or a short sharp tik tik tik</p>\n<p>Similar species: at first glance, the long-toed stint could be mistaken for a red-necked stint, being of similar size. The long-toed stint is darker above and brighter. The main separation from the red-necked stint is the colour of the legs &#x2013; the long-toed stint having yellow-green legs and the red-necked stint black legs.</p>\n<p>Once the leg colour has been established, separation from the very similar least sandpiper is important and careful study is needed. They both have similar coloured legs and colouring but the long-toed stint is darker above. They differ in shape: the long-toed stint is longer-legged and longer-necked than the compact least sandpiper, having more of the appearance of a sharp-tailed sandpiper (although sharp-tailed sandpiper is 60% larger). A subtle difference between long-toed stint and least sandpiper is that the mantle of the long toed stint appears striped (having dark central stripes and parallel rufous edges), while that of least sandpiper mantle appears scalloped (as the pale edges are narrower and curve toward one another at the rear). Also, long-toed stint scapulars and tertials are brown with broad complete rufous fringes enhancing the striped effect. Least sandpiper scapulars are much darker-centred, the outer and inner fringes differently coloured giving a black blotched appearance. Long-toed stint consistently shows a reddish cap, whereas very few least sandpipers are as bright. Long-toed stints may have paler base to the lower mandible, where this is consistently dark in least sandpiper. As their name suggests, long-toed stints do have longer toes, with the middle toe longer than the bill (cf. similar length to bill in the least sandpiper), but this is difficult to observe in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Long-toed stints breed in subarctic Siberia, and migrate to non-breeding areas in South-east Asia and, less commonly, Australia, where around 200 arrive each year. They can be found in saline, brackish or freshwater habitats.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The global population of long-toed stints is estimated to number more than 25,000 individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand&#x2019;s first long-toed stint was seen among red-necked stints at Lake Ellesmere on 31 August and 25 September 1997. The second bird was seen and photographed by a single observer at the same site on 6, 7 &amp; 16 December 2000.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Long-toed stints breed during June-July as isolated pairs near pools, in boggy wetlands, or on mountain tundra south of 50&#xB0; North. Their long toes and light bodyweight allow them to walk on floating vegetation. They are mildly gregarious, foraging singly or in small groups, and rarely up to 50 birds together.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Long-toed stints peck active prey from the substrate.

It breeds throughout much of the northern reaches of North America. They have a very wide non-breeding range, from Oregon and New Jersey, United States to northern Chile and central Brazil. Their migration habits differ from their close relatives the western and semipalmated sandpipers, as they do not form huge flocks, nor do they apparently depend upon a few key staging sites. These facts make it difficult to determine population size, however current estimates suggest a population of 700,000 individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The least sandpiper is a tiny sandpiper with yellowy-green legs and a bill that is black, slightly curved downwards and fine-tipped. During the non-breeding season its upper plumage is darkish brown, it has a brown upper breast, and white lower breast and belly. In breeding plumage the&#xA0;feathers of the upperparts are darker, with rufous edges, and the breast is finely streaked, reminiscent of a tiny pectoral sandpiper.</p>\n<p>Voice: a repetitive, high-pitched <em>preep</em></p>\n<p>Similar species: least sandpipers are distinguished from most other small sandpipers by their yellow-greenish legs. Due to their shared leg colour, they are only easily confused with Temminck&#x2019;s stint, long-toed stint, and broad-billed sandpiper. Temminck&#x2019;s stint (<em>C. temminckii</em>) is unlikely in NZ as its nonbreeding grounds are in Africa, India, and southeast Asia, and it has not been recorded from Australia. The differences between long-toed stints and least sandpipers are subtle. Long-toed stints are generally brighter, looking like a miniature sharp-tailed sandpiper, with a rufous cap and prominent pale supercilium. Least sandpipers tend to have a scalloped mantle compared to the striped mantle of long-toed stints. Long-toed stint is more elongated, with a longer neck and longer legs and toes, compared to the more compact least sandpiper. Long-toed stint also has a longer bill that is paler at the base. It is best to try to get photographs to enable detailed examination. Broad-billed sandpiper is larger, with a longer, heavier bill and a double (Y-shaped) supercilium.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The least sandpiper breeds throughout Alaska and much of continental northern Canada, including northern regions of Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec,&#xA0;Labrador&#xA0;and Newfoundland. Its non-breeding range extends from Oregon and New Jersey (United States) to northern Chile and central Brazil. During the non-breeding season, they can be found in a wide range of aquatic habitats including coastal beaches, mangroves, and freshwater wetlands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population of least sandpipers is estimated at 700,000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Single record: a bird observed at the mouth of the Wairoa River, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay in November 1952. Probable sightings at Ahuriri Estuary (November 1953) and the Firth of Thames (1972).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Like other small shorebirds, least sandpipers are gregarious and most often found in flocks; however they tend to feed in drier areas than other waders. They are not particularly flighty, and so an observer can often approach them quite closely before they fly away (much like wrybills).</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Least sandpipers eat insects and marine invertebrates, primarily amphipods and isopods.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Sandpiper\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Sandpiper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Least_Sandpiper/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Least_Sandpiper/id</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pbase.com/btblue/least_sandpiper\">http://www.pbase.com/btblue/least_sandpiper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3049\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3049</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brathwaite, D.H. 1955.

This is somewhat surprising, as they are one of the most abundant waders in North America with an estimated population of over 2 million birds. Their rarity in New Zealand may be due to their migration routes; although they breed throughout northern North America, from Alaska to Labrador they migrate through the centre of the continent or along the Atlantic Seaboard, foregoing the Pacific Coast.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The semipalmated sandpiper is a nondescript small grey shorebird with a straight, black, blunt-tipped bill and black legs. During the non-breeding season its upper plumage is greyish, it has a grey upper breast, and white lower breast and belly.

However, in North America, particularly along the Pacific Coast, it is one of the most abundant waders. In recent decades it was thought that their numbers were declining sharply. However, recent research suggests that the decrease in numbers does not represent a true population decline, but rather reflects changes in the birds&#x2019; migratory behaviour. It is believed that due to the recovery of their primary predator, peregrine falcons, western sandpipers (and likely many other species of waders) are using the landscape differently than they were at the end of the last century, and thus many are not being counted during annual surveys.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The western sandpiper is a small sandpiper with a relatively long, slightly down curved bill, slightly drooped at the tip. It has pale grey upperparts and white underparts. The upper breast has fine light grey streaking. The bill and legs are black. During the breeding season the crown, cheeks, and scapulars become bright rufous and the breast becomes heavily spotted.</p>\n<p>Voice: a high-pitched, raspy <em>cheet. </em>Western sandpipers often twitter while feeding.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the western sandpiper is easily confused with the other small peeps (i.e., stints and other small sandpipers). However its upperparts are grey and lack the brown hues that many other species possess (e.g., red-necked and little stints, Baird&#x2019;s and least sandpipers); furthermore the western sandpiper&#x2019;s bill is heavier and has more of a downward curve. These bill characteristics are shared with broad-billed sandpipers, which have olive-green legs (cf. black in western sandpiper).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Western sandpipers breed primarily in western Alaska and eastern Siberia and overwinter from southern North America to northern South America.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The western sandpiper is an extremely abundant species, with a total population estimated at 6.5 million birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are six accepted records of western sandpiper in New Zealand, all of single birds: Farewell Spit (October 1964), Rangaunu Harbour, Far North (November 1970), Firth of Thames (1970-71, November 1984), and Parengarenga Harbour (April 1976, January 1979).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The western sandpiper is a typical peep.

It is between a wrybill and a red-necked stint in size, and the few birds that reach New Zealand usually associate with either or both those species. Broad-billed sandpipers have short legs, a squat body and a long heavy black bill which droops at the end like a dunlin&#x2019;s.

It is most like a non-breeding dunlin, with the same heavy bill, drooped at the tip, giving a front-heavy appearance as though the bill is too long for the bird. The head, neck and upperparts are scaly brown-grey, with dark feather centres and paler edges. The underparts are mainly white, with dark speckling forming a light gorget on the breast. The diagnostic double supercilium is formed by parallel pale stripes above each eye, with a dark crown stripe between the two upper pale stripes. In breeding plumage this central stripe becomes black. A dark leading edge to the upperwing is apparent in flight, and there is a narrow white wingbar, and white sides to an otherwise blackish rump. The legs are greenish. Juvenile birds are much brighter, with rufous edges to back feathers and a prominent white V on the back feathers. Broad-billed sandpipers feed by vertical probing in mud and shallow pools, in a slower manner than stints.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice: a buzzing <em>chreeit</em>, and also <em>prrr</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: dunlin and western sandpiper (equally rare vagrants in New Zealand) have similar heavy bills, drooped at the tip, but have a poorly defined single supercilium and longer black legs. Western sandpiper is also smaller. Curlew sandpiper has a long bill that is decurved along the whole length, not just at the tip and has much longer legs than broad-billed sandpiper. It also lacks the striped head pattern, and has a white rump.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The broad-billed sandpiper is a Eurasian Arctic breeding species. The Eastern subspecies <em>sibirica</em> breeds in eastern Siberia and migrates to South-east Asia and north-western Australia.&#xA0;Very few come to New Zealand.

It is a lek-breeder, where extravagantly-plumaged males gather&#xA0;at display arenas where they each defend and display within a small mating court. Females (known as reeves) visit the lek to select a mate and copulate, then go elsewhere to do all the incubation and chick care. The male takes no further part in the breeding effort, and the most successful males can have many mates. The long plumes (particularly the ruff from which they get their name) are never seen in the southern hemisphere, presumably because they would impede their long-distance migration required to return to the breeding grounds in northern Eurasia. The ruff is the only member of the genus <em>Philomachus</em>, and is a rare vagrant to New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The ruff is a plump-bellied wader of variable size with a relatively long neck and small head with a short, slightly down-curved, typically dark bill. They show a large variability in size with males larger than the females (which are known as reeves). The non-breeding plumage of ruff and reeve is similar: uniform brown-grey back, white belly and throat with a faint brown band across the breast. The wing coverts may show a pale edge giving a scaly effect. The folded wings extend to the tip of the tail. In flight two distinctive oval patches of white on each side of the rump are visible, and there is also a narrow white wing bar. In breeding plumage ruff have black barred lower back and tail, and white undertail. The most noticeable features are the collar and head tufts, which may be a range of colours: black, purple, chestnut, buff in territorial males or white in satellite males. Faeder males (see later) resemble reeves, but are larger. The breeding plumage of the reeve is similar to non-breeding plumage with some mottling on the back and pale edges to the feathers and more colour on the throat. The leg colour (both sexes) ranges from red through yellow, green and brown to grey. Their flight is with erratic,&#xA0;slow wingbeats and flicking. Ruffs and reeves stand upright, but walk with the body horizontal. They feed in grass or by probing in mud.</p>\n<p>Voice: typically silent, but occasionally utters a muffled croak in flight.</p>\n<p>Similar species: buff-breasted sandpiper&#xA0;is smaller and browner, and lacks the white patches on the rump and wing bar. Non-breeding ruffs (including reeves) resemble sharp-tailed sandpiper in colouration and shape, but are much larger, have longer legs, and appear large-bellied and small-headed.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Ruffs breed in northern Europe and Siberia, and migrate (from mid-July) to Africa, the coasts of western Europe and southern Asia. There are also non-migrating populations in the Netherlands and Britain. They winter on marshy meadows, sewage farms, and lake edges, and less commonly on estuaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>World population 2,000,000 to 2,600,000 birds. The ruff is a rare migrant to Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The first New Zealand record was from the Manukau Harbour in 1964. There are seventeen other records: Colac Bay, Southland (1984-85), Lake Ellesmere (1984-85, 1991-92, 1999-2000), Lake Poukawa, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay (1985), Lake Wainono, South Canterbury (1987, 2002), Miranda (2001, 2005), Mangere (2001), Ahuriri Estuary, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay (2001), Waiongana River mouth, Taranaki (2002), Rakaia river mouth (2003), Kaiapoi (2004), Maketu (2005), Manukau Harbour (2006-07) and Nelson Haven (2007). Several other sightings were never submitted for verification.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Ruffs breed in &#x2018;leks&#x2019; in marshlands in northern Europe and Siberia. Typically 5 to 20 territorial males (those with coloured ruffs, c.84%) hold territories at the lek, with satellite males (those slightly smaller in size with white or mottled ruffs, c.16%) moving freely through the area. Faeder males (those intermediate in size between males and females, up to 1%) are permanent female mimics. Females mate with males at the lek, showing a preference for faeder males.

They are intermediate in size between the <em>Calidris</em> sandpipers and the godwits. They breed on lake shores, river deltas, wet grasslands and bogs in northern Canada, Alaska and Siberia. The Asiatic dowitcher is the largest of the three species and the only one which migrates along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, wintering mainly in equatorial regions but occasionally reaching New Zealand as a rare vagrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Asiatic dowitcher is a medium-large wader with a long, straight, blunt-tipped, dark bill. It has medium-length legs and long wings. In both breeding plumage (reddish head, breast and back; white undersides) and winter plumage (mottled grey-brown head, breast and back; white undersides) it looks similar to a bar-tailed godwit, with which it is very easily confused. The key identification points are (1) smaller size (about 85% the length and 60% the weight of a male bar-tailed godwit); and (2) the distinctive bill which is straight with an even thickness and consistent black colour through its entire length - quite different to the slightly upturned, bi-coloured (pink base, black tip) tapering bill of a bar-tailed godwit.</p>\n<p>Voice: generally silent when feeding, but on the wing will occasionally make a soft flight call variously described as <em>eouw</em>, <em>kiaow</em> or <em>kiow</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: bar-tailed godwit is slightly larger, with a slimmer, upturned bill that is pink at the base. Short-billed dowitcher and long-billed dowitcher (neither of which have been recorded from New Zealand) are smaller, with greenish legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Asiatic dowitchers breed in scattered pockets in the steppe and forest steppe regions of Siberia, Mongolia and north-east China. On migration they occur in small numbers in East Asia, the Indian sub-continent, the islands of South East Asia, northern Australia and New Guinea. In the non-breeding season they prefer coastal habitats, particularly inter-tidal mudflats. The bulk of the wintering population is concentrated in Sumatra and in Java, Indonesia. The global population is estimated at 23,000 birds but recent discoveries of large flocks in Indonesia indicate the population is likely &gt;50,000.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The Asiatic dowitcher has been recorded&#xA0;six times in New Zealand, with sight records from the Avon-Heathcote estuary, Christchurch (August-September 1985); Firth of Thames (February-May 1987); Farewell Spit (January 1988); Maketu estuary (November 1998),&#xA0;Ohiwa Harbour (October-December 2002), and Motueka Sandspit (December 2016 to February 2017). All records in New Zealand have been of single birds on estuaries, usually associating with bar-tailed godwits.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Asiatic dowitchers are gregarious in the non-breeding season, usually feeding and roosting amongst other wader species, especially godwits. They have a distinctive, vigorous feeding technique, involving repeated deep vertical probes by the bill as the bird moves forward. It is likened to a &#x201C;sewing-machine&#x201D; action and readily brings attention to a dowitcher amongst a flock of other waders.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Asiatic dowitchers eat marine worms, crabs, arthropods and crustaceans obtained mainly by deep probing.

It is a regular summer visitor to New Zealand but now in very small numbers, with probably fewer than 10 each summer since the mid 2000&#x2019;s, and usually at only a handful of sites. The eastern curlew is confined to the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF), with a global population estimated to be c.20,000 and declining.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The eastern curlew is an enormous wader with very long heavily decurved bill. The head and neck are streaked dark-brown, there is a thin white eye-ring, and the chin and throat are whitish. The upperparts are brown with pale olive-brown edging, the rump is brown, and the tail is greyish-brown with narrow dark banding. The underparts are dark brownish-buff, paler towards the vent, with fine dark-brown streaking turning to thicker arrow-shaped streaks on the flanks. The underwings are whitish, but appear darker due to the fine dark barring. The sexes are alike (apart from females being larger with longer bills); juveniles are similar, but with with back feathers neatly edged and notched with white, and with finer streaks on the underparts. </p>\n<p>Voice: a bubbling song <em>ker ker-ee-ker-ee</em> when disturbed.</p>\n<p>Similar species: in the New Zealand region only whimbrel and bristle-thighed curlew are possible confusion species. Both are smaller with shorter decurved bills and boldly streaked crowns. Eurasian curlew has occurred once in Australia and is distinguished by its extensive white rump and lower back and whiter underparts.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Eastern curlews breed in marshy, boggy habitat in eastern Mongolia, north-east China and eastern Siberia. In the non-breeding season they are mainly found on mudflats in northern and eastern Australia. In New Zealand, curlews are found in small numbers on major harbours and estuaries from Parengarenga in the Far North to Awarua Bay in Southland, with strongholds at Manukau Harbour and Farewell Spit. They have been recorded as vagrants on North Meyer Island (Kermadec Islands), and on Chatham, Stewart and Campbell Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The global population of eastern curlews was estimated at 38,000 in 2006 but is known to be declining. Based on winter counts in Australia, the population is now likely to number around 20,000. Annual declines between 1992 and 2008 averaged 2.4% in Moreton Bay, Queensland, a wintering stronghold. Numbers in New Zealand were regularly in the mid 40s during the 1980s but now fewer than 10 occur annually, with only 1 or 2 overwintering.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Eastern curlews are classed as&#xA0;Endangered by IUCN. Like most waders migrating along the EAAF, particularly for those using coastal wetlands in China and Korea, they are under serious threat from staging habitat loss, due mostly to reclamation and human based development and disturbance. Breeding grounds and most wintering sites are probably more secure although hunting and other disturbance maybe a factor on the breeding grounds, particularly in Russia. Human disturbance at southern wintering grounds in Australia are also of concern. Curlews are more susceptible to disturbance than most waders.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Eastern curlews breed from early May to late June. Nests typically contain 4 eggs and are placed on small mounds in swampy ground. Incubation is shared by both sexes. Chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and feed themselves on insects and other small invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The eastern curlew is a long distance migrant, making non-stop flights from east and north Australia direct to east Asia, from Taiwan northwards to major mudflat staging sites of the Yellow Sea. From there, the curlews fly directly to their breeding grounds. Southward migration follows a similar route and legs. They reach New Zealand from September to November and leave in March and April. Eastern curlews are very wary birds, and are difficult to approach. In New Zealand they may be solitary, associate with other curlews, or join with bar-tailed godwits.</p>\n<p>No birds banded overseas have been seen in New Zealand and none has been banded here.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Eastern curlews mainly eat crabs and small molluscs on the non-breeding grounds. They usually break crabs legs off first before swallowing the legs and body.

Most records are during the summer but a few birds occasionally overwinter. In New Zealand they typically associate with bar-tailed godwits, from which they differ in being darker, having a striped head and a strongly down-curved bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Whimbrels are somewhat larger than bar-tailed godwits and recognisable by their down-curved bill and pale stripe down the centre of crown. They are mottled dark brown above, pale below, with much brown streaking on the throat and breast. The head is conspicuously striped, with a pale eyebrow stripe separating the dark eye-stripe and side-crown, and another pale stripe down the centre of the crown. The rump and back pattern is very variable, ranging from largely white with some brown mottling, to heavily streaked brown appearing almost all dark at a distance. Most (possibly all) New Zealand birds are of the Asiatic form, and typically have a pale blaze up the back visible in flight. However, separation of Asiatic and American forms on rump pattern is unreliable as some Siberian birds have completely dark rumps, and it is uncertain whether any American whimbrels occur, or have ever occurred, in New Zealand. The underwing pattern of any &#x2018;dark-rumped&#x2019; whimbrel should be checked; both forms have underwngs heavily barred with brown, but American birds have a cinnamon-buff toned underwing (similar to bristle-thighed curlew) while Asiatic birds have a more greyish tone.</p>\n<p>Voice: a distinctive seven note whistle: <em>ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti.</em></p>\n<p>Similar species: eastern curlew is larger with proportionately much longer bill and no crown stripe. Little whimbrel has crown stripe but bill is finer and only slightly down curved. Bristle-thighed curlew is similar in size and structure but has overall cinnamon-buff colouration, a plain (unbarred) orange-buff rump, and a very different call.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Whimbrels may occur on estuaries throughout New Zealand, but most records are from the northern half of the North Island and Farewell Spit.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>About 70 whimbrels occur in New Zealand annually. The East Asian-Australasian Flyway population is estimated at 55,000. Numbers are thought to be declining. Whimbrels have been recorded as vagrant at the Kermadec and Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>About 50% of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway whimbrel population stages in the Yellow Sea on northward migration &#x2013; an area under severe threat from reclamation and pollution.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Whimbrels breed on Arctic tundra across Eurasia and North America. A clutch of 4 eggs is laid in a shallow scrape lined with small bits of vegetation.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In New Zealand, whimbrels occur singly or in small flocks on estuaries, often associating with bar-tailed godwits.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>In the non-breeding season whimbrels feed on a wide range of estuarine invertebrates including worms but particularly crabs.

The breast and abdomen are barred white and light brown, and the abdomen and under-tail is white. Back and upper wing surface a darker brown. Bill, legs and feet black, eye dark brown-black.

Other geese in New Zealand include the rare and vagrant Cape Barren goose and feral flocks of the domesticated greylag goose<em>.</em> </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Canada geese are widespread in the South Island and most numerous in pastoral areas of the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps from Marlborough to Central Otago, and around coastal lakes and lagoons. Their distribution is expanding in Fiordland and Southland. In the North Island, their distribution still reflects locations at which birds were released during the past 30 years, with the largest concentrations in Wairarapa, Hawkes Bay, Ruapehu-Taupo area, and Waikato. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pastoral land adjacent to a lake or large pond provides preferred habitat, but geese may also be found in well-forested mountain valleys, especially in Fiordland, and around alpine tarns. Communal moult gatherings at secluded or very large lakes with grazing available at the immediate margins. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Numbers are controlled by annual culls to reduce damage to lakeside pastures in some areas. Total population of about 60,000, two-thirds of which are in the South Island, and have been maintained at this number for most of the past decade. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Grazing of high-country lakeside pasture, especially autumn-saved pasture, is considered an economic burden for sheep farmers. Widespread irrigation to promote dairy farming in formerly dry country has allowed geese to remain year round and graze highly nutritious grasses. This prompted farmer advocacy to declare the bird a pest, and in 2011 the Canada goose was declared an unprotected species. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nests as solitary pairs but often in close proximity to other members of the flock. Monogamous, with female completing all of the incubation over about 27 days, and the gander actively defending a small territory around the nest. The nest is a down-lined ground depression often hidden amongst rushes or short protective vegetation. Clutch size generally 5 white eggs. Laying is mainly in September&#x2013;October but can also extend considerably later in the North Island, and second nestings have occasionally been recorded in December&#x2013;February. Both parents actively guard the young during their 8-9 weeks of growth until capable of flight. The family may remain together for several months and join with other pairs and families into an extended flock. When pairs nest in close proximity, amalgamation of broods and shared parental duties are common. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A wary, flocking bird generally seen on grassland in open spaces or on a lake&#x2019;s edge. Many flocks are extended multi-generation family groups and remain close to their breeding locations. Others, however, may undertake extensive moult migrations to larger waters where they undergo their annual wing moult. The bulk of these migrating birds are non-breeders or failed breeders; successful breeders usually moult their wing feathers on the breeding sites while still guarding their young. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Entirely herbivorous, preferring the sugar-laden bases of short grasses.

Birders would agree that the pink-eared duck is badly named, given the difficulty of seeing the pink ear in the field. When seen well however, it is a spectacular bird, not only for the pink feathers, but for its massive, oddly-shaped bill, and the striking zebra-striped sides. Highly nomadic, the pink-eared duck disperses widely in its native Australia, following good conditions for its breeding activities. It will breed in any month of the year when conditions are appropriate.</p>\n<p>The pink-eared duck is a small duck with a dark eye-patch and heavily barred sides. In good lighting conditions, a small patch of pink feathers can be seen behind the eye. Like the blue duck of New Zealand, the pink-eared duck possesses a laterally protruding membrane of skin at the tip of the bill. (Although spelled differently, the genus name of the pink-eared duck<em> Malacorhynchus</em>, is shared with the species name of the blue duck<em> malacorhynchos</em>; both mean &#x2018;soft-beak&#x2019;). At a distance, the boldly barred flanks, lower neck and breast, combined with the dark eye-patch, wide-tipped bill, and whitish face are the best identification features. In flight, the tail tip and trailing edge of the wings are white, as is a narrow band on the rump. The head is held high whilst flying. The sexes are the same, with the female slightly smaller. Immature birds are paler than adults, with the pink ear patch less vivid.</p>\n<p>Voice: sounds described include a trilling, chirruping or twittering, often given in flight; a high-pitched, sharp <em>ee-jik</em> or <em>tu-ick</em>; a low nasal <em>grunk</em>; and the bill-tossing call <em>whee-ooo</em>, <em>weeee-you</em> or <em>who-ee-oo</em>. Similar species: the Australasian shoveler shares the massive bill of the pink-eared duck, but is considerably larger, has a flat forehead leading in a straight line to the bill (the pink-eared has a prominent forehead), and the shoveler sits much lower in the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Endemic to Australia, the pink-eared duck is widespread, except for in the driest parts of Western and South Australia. Its greatest population density is in south-eastern Australia (although not in great numbers along the eastern seaboard), and the south-west corner of Western Australia. It is a rare visitor to Tasmania.</p>\n<p>The pink-eared duck favours inland wetlands, and avoids coastal wetlands with high rainfall. It tends to stay away from the shore when feeding. It prefers stagnant, shallow water rich in aquatic life, including sewage ponds, and avoids fast-moving, clear or deep water.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>A single bird was at the Mangere sewage ponds, Auckland, June-July 1990.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Even whilst in large flocks, the pink-eared duck remains in pairs. These will feed in a head-to-tail vortexing motion, each benefiting from the other disturbing aquatic organisms as they rotate. When feeding, their bills are frequently submerged to the line of the eyes, and they do not &#x2018;up-end&#x2019;. They often perch out of the water, e.g. on logs and branches. They fly with rapid wing-beats, and when flushed will circle wetlands.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The bill of the pink-eared duck is lined with fine lamellae for filter-feeding. The diet is mostly invertebrates (crustaceans and insects), and plant-matter including seeds.

Almost nothing is known about the species because it became extinct before European contact and its bones are rare. We can only speculate that it shared many habits with its presumed closest relative, the blue-billed duck (<em>Oxyura australis</em>) of Australia. It was probably an uncommon resident on lakes and swamps throughout New Zealand. Although the presence of <em>Oxyura</em> fossils in New Zealand was suggested as early as 1983, based on bones excavated in the 1960s and 70s, it was not until 2005 that this genus was confirmed for New Zealand (Worthy 2005). The specific name honours Gerry van Tets (1929-1995) who first identified the New Zealand fossils as being from the genus <em>Oxyura</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>A small compact duck, bearing a superficial resemblance to the New Zealand scaup but likely to have had the distinctive sexual plumage dimorphism shown by its Australian cousin. In breeding plumage, males of the Australian species are a rich chestnut colour with a black head and a cobalt-blue bill, while non-breeders, females and juveniles are a duller brown. All other members of the genus <em>Oxyura</em> have a distinctive stiff tail, so it can be theorised that the New Zealand form shared this feature and some of the distinctive behavioural traits of the genus. The New Zealand species was slightly smaller than the Australian species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils of the New Zealand blue-billed duck have been found at two sites only (representing 20+ individuals) and all but one bone is from Holocene deposits at&#xA0;Lake Poukawa in Hawke&apos;s Bay. A single South Island bone may be from the Wairau Bar, near Blenheim. The species probably shared the habits of the closely related Australian species which is almost wholly aquatic, often on large permanent wetlands. During the breeding season the Australian species is thinly distributed in densely vegetated swamps and secretive but it can form large flocks in open water in the non-breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Extreme rarity of the species in the New Zealand fossil record probably partly reflects the lack of fossil deposits from lakes rather than a true scarceness in life.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand blue-billed duck became extinct before European contact, and so no records of live birds exist.

Incubation and parental care is by the female only. The Australian species is renowned for its extraordinarily long pseudopenis, which is grossly large in proportion to the size of the bird.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The related Australian blue-billed duck has several elaborate displays, including holding its stiff tail semi-erect for courtship and alarm displays.

It and the extinct New Zealand blue-billed duck are the only members of the subfamily Oxyurinae (stiff-tailed ducks) ever reported from New Zealand. The rarity of New Zealand musk duck bones and its prehistoric extinction mean that almost nothing is known about it. We can only speculate that it shared many habits with its closest relative - the only other musk duck in the world - <em>Biziura lobata</em> of Australia. The New Zealand species was named after Dr. H. de Lautour of Oamaru who helped acquire fossils from Otago&apos;s Enfield swamp where the first New Zealand musk duck bone was found.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand musk duck was a very large duck. The New Zealand species was about ten percent larger than its Australian cousin and, apart from being larger overall, had relatively large legs but relatively short wings. While it may have been evolving towards a more sedentary lifestyle, its skeletal proportions suggest that it could still fly. Presuming that it shared features with the Australian species, it would have had a distinctive appearance. The Australian species is a short-necked, thickset bird with a broad beak and a stiff tail. Musk ducks are unusual for having a large size difference between the sexes, the males emit a pungent musky smell in the breeding season, and they have a huge lobe that hangs below their bill. The Australian species is a mottled grey-brown colour, so the New Zealand species was probably fairly drab in colour also.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils of the New Zealand musk duck have been found at&#xA0;five sites only (representing&#xA0;at least nine&#xA0;individuals) spread throughout New Zealand.

During the breeding season the Australian species is thinly distributed in densely vegetated swamps but it sometimes forms flocks on open water bodies in the non-breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Rarity in the fossil record suggests that the New Zealand musk duck was largely confined to deep stable water bodies that are represented by few fossil sites in New Zealand.&#xA0; It may never have been common.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand musk duck became extinct in prehistoric times, and so no records of live birds exist.

It has undergone a remarkable increase in population and distribution since about 1990, including the colonisation of sports fields and other open grassed areas within urban environments. This expansion has occurred in the face of being a gamebird and hunted annually.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The paradise shelduck is a conspicuous and colourful species with contrasting male and female plumages. Between a large duck and a small goose in size, the male is uniformly dark grey or black while the female body is a dark or light chestnut (depending on age and state of moult). The male&#x2019;s head is black with occasional green iridescence and the female&#x2019;s head and upper neck is white. Both sexes have a chestnut undertail, black primary wing feathers, green secondary wing feathers and a conspicuously white upper wing surface. Variable amounts of white may occur on the heads of males during the eclipse moult (February-May) and newly-fledged juvenile females may retain an extensive black head with a white face patch until they complete their post-juvenal moult (by May). The bill, legs and feet are dark grey/black. Down-covered ducklings appear initially as &#x201C;mint humbugs&#x201D;, patterned brown-and-white. The first feathers are dark, and near-fledged ducklings of both sexes resemble the adult male.</p>\n<p>Voice: the male paradise shelduck gives a di-syllabic goose-like honk when alarmed, or in flight. The main female call is more shrill, and more rapid and persistent, particularly during flight. There are a variety of other calls associated with pair formation and maintenance, territory defence, and maintaining contact with flock birds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: vagrant chestnut-breasted shelducks are very similar to male paradise shelducks. They differ in having a white neck ring, chestnut or buff breast, and black undertail.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The paradise shelduck is New Zealand&#x2019;s most widely distributed waterfowl, when both geographic spread and habitat use are taken into account. It occurs on North, South and Stewart Islands, all large near-shore islands with grassland (e.g. Kapiti, Great Barrier, D&#x2019;Urville) and has straggled to distant Raoul and Lord Howe Islands, and to the Chatham Islands from which an as-yet unnamed shelduck species was exterminated by the first Polynesian settlers.</p>\n<p>Paradise shelducks occur throughout the pastoral landscape, whether high country or lowlands, on river flats in mountain areas, at heads of protected bays or fiords, around the shorelines of all large lakes and hydro-dams, and increasingly on recreational grasslands and parks within urban areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The paradise shelduck is the second-most abundant waterfowl in New Zealand (after mallard). Its numbers are still increasing despite being a gamebird and at least 200,000 being shot annually (2011 figures). The total population probably exceeded 6-700,000 birds in 2011.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The paradise shelduck is so widespread and abundant as to be without conservation threat. Excessive hunting in the past severely impacted numbers, and 2-3 decades of cautious exploitation was required to restore their abundance and expand their distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>When aggregated in large flocks, especially on pastures alongside moult sites or on newly-sown pasture, the grazing impacts of paradise shelducks are regarded as intolerable by farmers. Occasional culling, or harassment of flocks generally alleviates this problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding:</strong></p>\n<p>Paradise shelducks disperse as territorial pairs for breeding, and pairs occupy their territories year-round except when at a communal moult site. Hence birds are invariably seen as single pairs. Pair bonds may persist for several years but are regularly challenged by unpaired individuals. Territories usually contain some water body on which the brood will seek refuge. However, broods can be raised in wet areas without access to open water.</p>\n<p>Females prospect potential nest sites within or beyond the territory in tree holes or bases, rock crevices, under buildings or debris piles and will use almost any site that confers overhead cover and has just a single entrance. Egg-laying is usually in August and September but young birds and some repeat nesters will lay in October, but rarely later. Clutches of 5-15 are reported but most over 12 will have been contributed to by two females. Incubation is by the female only and takes 30-35 days. Both parents guard the ducklings for 55-65 days until able to fly. Parents will perform a broken-wing display to distract mammalian predators and sometimes people. Some broods may amalgamate. The family may remain together for several weeks thereafter, with the bond broken when the parents depart for the communal moulting sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Populations are structured as territorial breeding pairs and flocks, the latter comprising mostly first-year and some second-year pre-breeders. Flocks mostly inhabit extensive river-side pastoral flats or expansive areas of young grass. The annual communal moult extends over January-March. Birds gather in large numbers around isolated or large ponds or lakes, or on expansive riverbeds, to shed all wing feathers.</p>\n<p><strong>Food&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Paradise shelducks are generally herbivorous, with a preference for pasture grasses and clover. An extensive diet has been recorded that embraces a broad range of leaves and seeds of terrestrial herbs, some aquatic plants, and terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Shelduck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Shelduck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/paradise-duck-putakitaki/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/paradise-duck-putakitaki/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/putangi.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/putangi.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/page-5\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/page-5</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Marchant, S.J.; Higgins, P.

It is closely related to the endemic paradise shelduck with which it shares many plumage features. Chestnut-breasted shelducks often fly several hundred kilometres between breeding sites (used in winter and spring), to moulting sites, where they congregate in large numbers. Although apparently faithful to its nesting locations, the place where moult occurs can vary from year to year. Until the 1970s, it was known in Australia as the mountain duck, but is now most commonly referred to there as the Australian shelduck.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The chestnut-breasted shelduck is a large, mostly dark duck with a striking chestnut breast, white neck ring, and chestnut and green speculum. Females have a white eye-ring, and white at the base of the bill. The chestnut breast is darker on the female. The white neck ring of the male is often more sharply demarcated than that of the female. When seen together in pairs, the smaller size of the female is apparent. In flight, the white underwing and forewing are conspicuous, with the same pattern as the paradise shelduck.</p>\n<p>Voice: a series of honks and grunts, similar to paradise shelduck, often very vocal, loud and harsh. The female&#x2019;s call is higher in pitch than the male.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the chestnut-breasted shelduck is most similar to a male paradise shelduck, from which it can be distinguished by the bright and conspicuous chestnut breast and white neck ring, and in the case of female chestnut-breasted shelduck, the white eye-ring and white at base of bill. Note also the dark undertail coverts (these are chestnut in paradise shelducks).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Chestnut-breasted shelducks are largely confined to south-west and south-east Australia. They are spreading northwards in the west of their range, possibly as a result of favourable changes in its habitat due to land-clearing. Chestnut-breasted shelducks disperse widely from their breeding sites, and apart from vagrancy to New Zealand, were recorded on Norfolk Island in the 1980s. They use a wide variety of habitats, including brackish water (and even the sea occasionally), farmland, woodland, crops, irrigation areas, and stubble. Most New Zealand sightings have been on lowland wetlands, often with paradise shelducks.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Chestnut-breasted shelducks were first recorded from New Zealand in 1973 at Hokitika River. There was an influx during 1982-86, with some birds persisting for several years, especially in Marlborough. They have been recorded regularly if infrequently since 2000. Chestnut-breasted shelduck have reached nearly all of New Zealand&apos;s outlying island groups, with records from Raoul Island, Kermadec Islands (1994), Pitt Island, Chatham Islands (1998), Snares Islands (1984), Enderby Island, Auckland Islands (1983-84), and Campbell Island (1984-85). Most records have been of single birds, but occasionally up to three birds. There is one confirmed breeding record, from near Lake Tekapo, where a pair with half-grown young was seen in January 1985. Birds have been seen in most districts of the South and North Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, chestnut-breasted shelducks can often be seen in flocks of up to 1,000 or more. Like paradise shelducks, they are typically wary and difficult to approach, but can become habituated to people in urban settings. They are very upright both on land where&#xA0;they graze at dawn and dusk, and on the water, where&#xA0;they sit very high. Although young birds dive frequently, adults only dive during their moulting period when they are flightless, or when injured or frightened. Chestnut-breasted shelducks usually breed in a down-lined cavity of a hollow tree-limb, but also sometimes in caves or burrows, and sometimes under vegetation. After leaving the nesting hollow, the flightless, downy young may aggregate in cr&#xE8;ches of 20-40, or in extreme cases, a hundred birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chestnut-breasted shelducks can feed by grazing, dabbling or filtering. They consume tubers and other plant material, including of saltbush and samphire, along with a range of crustaceans, insects and molluscs. There are few New Zealand data.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/australian-shelduck-tadorna-tadornoides\">http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/australian-shelduck-tadorna-tadornoides</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/australian-shelduck\">http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/australian-shelduck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Shelduck\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Shelduck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Tadorna-tadornoides\">http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Tadorna-tadornoides</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://australianmuseum.net.au/Australian-Shelduck\">http://australianmuseum.net.au/Australian-Shelduck</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gill, B.J.; Bell, B.D.; Chambers, G.K.; Medway, D.G.; Palma, R.L.; Scofield, R.P.

Five of the six extant species have broad distributions in cool temperate and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where they primarily or exclusively inhabit lakes and rivers. The sixth, the now very rare Brazilian merganser (<em>Mergus octosetaceus</em>) once occurred more widely on Brazilian and Argentine rivers. A coastal and marine habitat has been ascribed to the New Zealand mergansers, which contrasts with the habitat of other mergansers notwithstanding the red-breasted merganser&#x2019;s (<em>M. serrator</em>) seasonal use of sheltered coastal bays, coves and estuaries.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Auckland Island merganser, there was a separate merganser species on the Chatham Islands (<em>Mergus milleneri</em>). Merganser fossils from mainland New Zealand cannot yet be assigned to either of the named species.</p>\n<p>The former occurrence of mergansers in the New Zealand region is an as-yet unexplained bio-geographic oddity, and there is uncertainty about the relationships of these mergansers with all others.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The sexes of the Auckland Island merganser were similar to each other, but males were larger and had an obvious and elongated crest. The head and neck were dark brown, the entire upper body dark grey, and the breast and abdomen dull greyish-brown. The upper wings were slate grey, and the lower wing coverts were darker and banded white. The middle secondary flight feathers were white on the outer web and black on the inner web and tips, with the primary flight feathers and inner secondaries tending blackish. The eyes were dark brown, and the upper bill black but with its cutting edge and the lower mandible yellowish-orange; the legs and feet were orange. Immature birds were darker versions of the adults. Ducklings were dark brown-black above with yellowish-white underparts. Their bill, legs and feet were dark olive-brown.</p>\n<p>Voice: &#x201C;Quacking like a duck&#x201D; is the only recorded description of the call of the Auckland Island merganser.</p>\n<p>Similar species: there were no species that the Auckland Island merganser could have been confused with at its last retreat around the coasts of the Auckland Islands. Around mainland New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, the yellow-footed <em>Stictocarbo</em> shags (spotted shag and Pitt Island shag) were (and are) common around coastlines, and were of similar body shape and colouration to the Auckland Island merganser. However, the two shags were slightly larger and had different head colouration and crest formation, and many structural differences if seen at sufficiently close range.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>A total of 27&#xA0;specimens are known to have been obtained from the Auckland Islands. Merganser bones found in natural deposits and Maori middens at sites on North, South, and Stewart Islands&#xA0;are possibly referable to the same species.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>All bones unearthed have been at coastal or estuarine sites, except for Lake Poukawa in inland Hawkes Bay. Auckland Island specimens were obtained at the coastal edge at the heads of the island&#x2019;s eastern inlets and bays. It is possible this species was also a resident of rivers and lakes in pre-human New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The Auckland Island population was probably always tiny, possibly as few as 20-30 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Mergansers were extirpated following Polynesian settlement of New Zealand and Chatham Islands. The Auckland Island population would have been severely diminished by predation by pigs and cats following their release onto Auckland Island in the 1820s, and possibly also by being a food for early sealers at the island. The earnest collecting of specimens for museums, especially in the 1890s, led to the last specimen being seen, and collected, in January 1902, a mere 60 years after the merganser&#x2019;s initial discovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>No nests or eggs were ever recorded and only two broods of ducklings (both of 4 young) were observed. Both broods were seen in January and suggest a late summer nesting period akin to that of other Auckland Island waterfowl.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island&#xA0;merganser pairs were probably strongly territorial, maintaining their territory and relationship year-round. The eastern inlets of Auckland Island and the bays within Carnley Harbour each have a small feeding stream and it is unlikely that more than one pair could have occupied any inlet and bay.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>A specimen collected in 1901 had a 90 mm (&#x201C;3.5 in&#x201D;) koaro (<em>Galaxias brevipinnis</em>), a freshwater fish, in its bill. The gut contents of a preserved carcass at the Natural History Museum, UK (presumably from a specimen collected in 1901 or 1902) comprised &#x201C;macerated fish bones, mandibles of an errant polychaete and an unidentified gastropod&#x201D;. Analyses of stable isotope content of bones indicates that mergansers at the Auckland Islands fed in both marine and fresh waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Merganser\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Merganser</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/aimerganser.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/aimerganser.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Kear, J. &amp; Scarlett, R. 1970.

It and the extinct Auckland Island merganser are the only mergansers known from Australasia and Oceania. Little is known about the Chatham Island merganser as there are no records of it being seen alive. Evidently it became extinct in prehistoric times from human impacts. The Chatham Island species name honours Dr Philip Millener, former curator of fossil birds at New Zealand&#x2019;s national museum, who collected most of the material that is known for the species.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island merganser was smaller than all other <em>Mergus</em> species. Compared with its close relative, the Auckland Island merganser, the Chatham Island species had a shorter skull and beak and larger salt-glands. The Chatham Island bird&#x2019;s wing, pectoral and pelvic bones were also smaller but its leg bones were a similar size to those of the Auckland Island merganser. Most bones of the Chatham Island merganser were 3-6% smaller than those of the Auckland Island species. Compared with other <em>Mergus</em> species, the Chatham Island and Auckland Island mergansers had a lesser ability to fly but they were not flightless. Male mergansers of all species are a little larger than females. Presuming that the Chatham Island species shared key plumage features with its Auckland Islands cousin, the Chatham Island species was probably a relatively dull-coloured bird with a small head crest.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils of the Chatham Island merganser have been found in natural and archaeological sites only on the main Chatham Island and not on the smaller offshore islands. Suitable habitat on Chatham Island would have included the many small lakes, small slow peat-stained rivers and the dominating barrier-bar Te Whanga Lagoon, which comprises 20% of the island&#x2019;s area. The Chatham Island merganser&#x2019;s skeletal proportions suggest that it may have been evolving towards a more sedentary lifestyle.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils suggest that the Chatham Island merganser was once widespread on Chatham Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island merganser became extinct in prehistoric times, and so no records of live birds exist. A few bones have been found in human food middens, and hunting for food by people is the most likely cause of the species&#x2019; demise.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Abundant remains of adult Chatham Island mergansers, and some chick and egg remains, were retrieved from a small cave on the shoreline of Te Whanga Lagoon. This indicates that the cave was a popular nesting site for the species. This might have been expected because other merganser species worldwide are hole-nesters and females carry out all incubation duties.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Other than its nesting behaviour, almost nothing is known of the Chatham Island merganser&#x2019;s behaviour or ecology. The extensive salt glands on the skull of the species suggest that it spent a considerable time in coastal waters, particularly perhaps the saline waters of Te Whanga Lagoon. All mergansers have tooth-like serrations on their bill margins, used for catching fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Mergansers are primarily fish eaters, which they pursue and then catch with their serrated bill-margins.&#xA0; Nothing specific is known about the food of the Chatham Island species but presumably the diverse freshwater fish fauna would have provided abundant fare. It is likely to have fed on a broad range of fishes, and perhaps aquatic invertebrates, in the large brackish Te Whanga Lagoon and possibly in shallow coastal waters as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Merganser\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Merganser</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Tennyson, A.J.D.; Martinson, P. 2007 (revised edn). <em>Extinct birds of New Zealand</em>.

Molecular genetic studies show that the Australian wood duck is related to shelducks (<em>Tadorna</em> spp.), not to pygmy-geese (<em>Nettapus</em> spp.) as previously thought from its outward appearance. Vagrants in much earlier times, perhaps during one of the Pleistocene glaciations, are thought to have given rise to the now-extinct New Zealand species, Finsch&#x2019;s duck, <em>Chenonetta finschi</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian wood duck is a sexually dimorphic species, with males and females differing primarily in their head and underbody colour and patterns; the female is also slightly smaller. The adult male has a uniform dark-brown head and neck, with a short black mane down the back of the neck, hence the species&#x2019; other name: maned duck. The lower neck and upper breast are speckled brown and pale grey gradually fading to grey in the lower breast. The mantle and upper back are grey with a faint brown wash. The tail, undertail coverts, and belly are black. The flanks look grey from a distance but when seen close-up are finely vermiculated black on a grey background. In contrast, the female has a lighter greyish-brown head, with two pale grey stripes, one from just above the eyes back to the ear-coverts, the other below the eyes, extending from the base of the bill to the ear coverts. The lower neck, breast and flanks are spotted brown and white, the markings aligned in places, producing a barred appearance. The upper back is grey-brown, becoming darker brown further back. The upper tail coverts are pale brown tinged with grey; the undertail covers are off-white, the same colour as the belly. The tail is black-brown. Both sexes have the same bold wing pattern, with dark primaries that contrast with white secondaries, which create a broad white panel on the trailing edge of the inner upperwing. Males have a narrow speculum of iridescent green or indigo just in front of the white panel (this is brown and only slightly iridescent in females). Both sexes have dark brown-black scapulars that form a stripe on either side of the upper body, separated in turn from the dark central back by a narrow strip of grey body feathers (much browner in the female). Adult males have a non-breeding &#x2018;eclipse&#x2019; plumage that is similar to the female plumage but with less distinct face markings. The bill is short and goose-like, quite deep at the base, grey in both sexes. The legs are grey, tinged light brown, occasionally greenish; the eyes are dark brown.</p>\n<p>Voice: various nasal calls, most commonly a drawn-out <em>mew</em> or <em>new</em> given by female, and a shorter, wheezy <em>wee-ow</em> given by the male.</p>\n<p>Similar species: none in New Zealand, although the striking white wing pattern of a bird in flight might be confused with paradise shelduck, which is bigger, darker, and has white scapulars not secondaries. The grey teal, which shows white on the secondaries above a large greenish speculum, is smaller, slimmer, and browner.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian wood duck is an endemic Australian species, found most commonly along the southeast and eastern part of the continent and in Western Australia. During wet years, many birds move to central Australia to breed. Elsewhere in Australia it is a vagrant. Most New Zealand sightings have been at wetlands, including sewage ponds, rivers, estuaries, and small lakes. In Australia, wood ducks are quite terrestrial, often grazing on lawns and open areas with short grass close to rivers and billabongs.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are accepted records of Australian wood ducks from Glendhu, Wanaka, Central Otago (1910); Orawia, near Invercargill, Southland (1944); Wairau River, Marlborough (1980); Snares Islands (1982-1986); Otapiri, Southland (May 2002); Nelson Sewage Ponds (June 2010); Bromley Sewage Works, Christchurch (January 2011); and Horseshoe Lake, Christchurch (May 2011). These last two or three records may be of the same bird. Several other records have yet to be submitted to the Records Appraisal Committee of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand. A pair bred successfully near Mapua (Tasman Bay) in 2015 and 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, most of the wood ducks banded and subsequently recovered had not moved far from where they were originally marked, but the species is known to be nomadic during exceptionally wet years, when large numbers move inland to breed along flooded creeks and billabongs. The farthest recovery of a marked bird was one shot in north central Queensland, 1720 km from where it was originally banded in south-western New South Wales 17 months earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, wood ducks are largely terrestrial grazers, eating grass, clover, other herbs, and grass seeds; also takes insects, especially on water.

The broad bill is part of a suite of adaptations for feeding on minute marine organisms. Analogous with baleen whales, broad-billed prions have a fringe of comb-like filters around the upper mandible, a distensible pouch between the bowed lower mandibles, and a muscular tongue to force water out through the filters.

All six prion species look very similar at sea, being slightly smaller than a red-billed gull, blue-grey and black above, and white below. Broad-billed prions breed around southern New Zealand and in large numbers on the Chatham Islands. The southern populations were decimated by a winter storm in 2011, when an estimated quarter of a million birds were blown ashore and died, mainly on west coast beaches of the North Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>All six prion species are all very similar in appearance and behaviour, differing mainly in bill shape. All are medium-small seabirds that are blue-grey above and white below, with a blackish &#x2018;M&#x2019; across the back from wingtip to wingtip, a black tip to the upper tail, and blue bill, legs and feet. The broad-billed prion is the largest prion species, and has a bill that is both more massive (18.7-24.3 mm wide) and darker than all other prion species. The bill is lead-grey, shading to blue at the widest margins, and with a blue lower mandible. The broad-billed prion is also darker on the upper breast than other prions, with blue-grey tabs extending from the shoulders to almost form a collar.</p>\n<p>Voice: broad-billed prions are silent at sea, but are vocal on the ground at night at their breeding colonies, giving harsh chattering calls and softer crooning. In dense colonies this can merge into a wall of sound.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Salvin&#x2019;s prion is the &#x2018;next-broadest&#x2019; of the prions, and is sometimes known as the lesser broad-billed prion (bill 13.5-17.5 mm wide). It is a slightly smaller bird, with a bluer bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Broad-billed prions breed on many of the muttonbird islands in Foveaux Strait and around Stewart Island, and also on the Snares, Solander and Codfish Islands, and a few outer islands in Fiordland. The largest colony in the New Zealand region is on Rangatira Island in the Chatham Islands, and they also breed on many other islands in the Chatham Islands. Elsewhere, broad-billed prions breed in enormous numbers on Gough and Nightingale Islands in the South Atlantic, with smaller numbers on the nearby Tristan da Cunha and Inaccessible Islands.&#xA0; They are most often seen over the open sea near breeding colonies, and do not enter sheltered coastal waters. Vagrants occasionally strand on Australian beaches, particularly in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.</p>\n<p>Most New Zealand colonies are under low forest or among dense ground cover. When at low densities the birds breed in caves and rock crevices, or in burrows around rock outcrops. At higher densities their burrows honeycomb the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>No-one realised how abundant broad-billed prions were in New Zealand until about 250,000 of them died during a severe storm in July 2011 &#x2013; without any detectable decline in the largest colony on Rangatira Island, Chatham Islands. There are an estimated 300,000 pairs under forest on Rangatira Island, and probably a similar number in non-forested areas on the island. It is thought that the 2011 storm wiped out 80-90% of the southern New Zealand population (Fiordland-Foveaux-Snares), but there were few population estimates available other than the Snares Islands, where 2-5,000 pairs were estimated on the main island in the 1980s. The Gough Island population is estimated to be in the low millions of pairs.</p>\n<p>Before the 2011 mortality event, the largest recorded wreck of broad-billed prions on New Zealand beaches was 1385 birds in 1961.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Broad-billed prions are abundant only on islands that lack introduced predators. Massive declines or local extinctions occurred on several islands following predator introductions or colonisations, including islands in Dusky Sound, Fiordland (following rat and stoat arrival), Herekopare Island (cat introduction), and Jacky Lee Island (weka introduction). Broad-billed prions should have benefitted from rat and weka eradications on several muttonbird islands off Stewart Island, but the 2011 mortality event (caused by a severe storm) will have set their recovery back by decades. Southern skuas take a heavy toll of broad-billed prions at many colonies.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Broad-billed prions are colonial breeders, nesting as monogamous pairs in short burrows or rock crevices, mainly on small islands. The single egg is laid from late August to mid September and hatches in late October to early November. Incubation is shared in shifts of 5-7 days, and both parents feed the chick by regurgitation right through to fledging. Chicks depart the colonies from mid-December to late January.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Broad-billed prions mainly occur in dispersed flocks at sea. They are not attracted to boats. Food items are mainly captured while sitting on the sea surface or hydroplaning &#x2013; facing into the wind with wings extended, and dipping the head and neck into the upper 10 cm of the water column. They are non-migratory, staying in New Zealand waters throughout the year. Birds can be found ashore at colonies in any month of the year, but few visit for the 4-5 weeks after chicks fledged.</p>\n<p>Broad-billed prions excavate their own burrows, or utilise caves and rock crevices. They visit breeding sites after dark and depart before dawn, or stay in burrows or nest crevices during daylight. On the Snares Islands, broad-billed prions occasionally fly over nesting areas in daylight.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Broad-billed prions mainly eat zooplankton, especially copepods, obtained from filtering seawater through the comb-like lamellae that fringe the upper mandible. Other prey items include euphausiid krill, amphipods, stalked barnacles and small fish. Small squid are also taken, especially outside the breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-billed_Prion\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-billed_Prion</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3914\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3914</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2011/07/18/riders-of-the-storm-thousands-of-seabirds-perish-on-new-zealand-shores/\">Riders of the storm - thousands of seabirds perish on New Zealand shores</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"Te Papa Channel - Bird Man!\" href=\"http://channel.tepapa.govt.nz/video/bird-man-expedition-snares-islands/\">Bird man!

Elsewhere, they breed in vast colonies on South Georgia, and also on South Sandwich, South Orkney, South Shetland, Crozet, Kerguelen, Heard, Macquarie and Scott Islands, and possibly at a few sites on the Antarctic continent. They nest in burrows under low forest or tussock, or in rock crevices. At sea, Antarctic prions mainly occur south of the Antarctic Convergence, including among pack-ice, north to 50&#xB0; S south of New Zealand in summer. In winter they often wash ashore on west coast beaches as far north as Ninety Mile Beach, and occasionally on Raoul Island, Kermadec Islands, also east to Chatham Islands (including two birds caught at night there).</p>\n<p>There are few claimed sightings of Antarctic prions off the New Zealand mainland, but this is partly due to the extreme difficulty of separating prion species at sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand population has not been surveyed, and is roughly estimated at between 100,000 and a million pairs. Breeding has been recorded from Auckland, Adams, Enderby, Ewing and Ocean Islands in the Auckland Island group, but is likely to occur on other islands there also (e.g. Disappointment and Rose Islands). The world population is many millions of pairs, with 22 million pairs estimated for South Georgia, and 2-3 million pairs at Kerguelen Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Large numbers of Antarctic prions are killed by feral cats and pigs on Auckland Island. This species is expected to benefit from the 2001 eradication of Norway rats (and natural extinction of feral cats) on Campbell Island, and the 1993 eradication of rabbits (which compete for burrows) from Enderby and Rose Islands in the Auckland Islands. Eradication of cats and pigs on Auckland Island would be of enormous benefit to Antarctic prions, as well as many other seabird and landbird species. Antarctic prions are occasionally caught in nets used to catch squid near the Auckland Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Not studied in New Zealand. On Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, Antarctic prions breed in large colonies. They return in late October, lay in mid to late December, and the young depart from mid March to early April.

It often feeds in large flocks over tide rips near offshore rocks and islands. Slightly smaller than a red-billed gull, fairy prions are very similar in appearance to the five other prion species: blue-grey and black above, and white below, with blue bill and legs. This colouration and their habit of flying along wave troughs make prions difficult to follow with binoculars from a moving boat deck. The Poor Knights Islands are the only northern breeding site, but fairy prions breed in burrows and rock crevices on many islands from Cook Strait south, including on the Chatham Islands and several subantarctic island groups. The largest colony holds an estimated 1.8 million pairs. Fairy prions, along with other prion species, are often found storm-wrecked on beaches exposed to the open ocean, especially on the west coast of both main islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>All six prion species are very similar in appearance and behaviour, differing mainly in bill shape. All are medium-small seabirds that are blue-grey above and white below, with a blackish &#x2018;M&#x2019; across the back from wingtip to wingtip, a black tip to the upper tail, and blue bill, legs and feet. The fairy prion is the smallest prion species, and is most similar to the much rarer fulmar prion. Both these species have relatively chunky bills lacking comb-like lamellae along the margins of the upper mandible, and have a broader black tip to the upper tail compared to other prions. They also have more ill-defined facial markings than the other prion species.</p>\n<p>Voice: fairy prions rarely call at sea, but they are vocal on the ground at night at their breeding colonies, giving harsh chattering calls and softer crooning.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the bill of the fulmar prion, and particularly the nail of the upper mandible, is more massive than in the fairy prion, and the fulmar prion has a smaller gap between the nostril tube and the terminal nail.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy prions breed on the Poor Knights Islands, islands in the outer Marlborough Sounds (especially Stephens Island, Trio Islands and The Brothers), rock stacks and islets off the West Coast (including the Open Bay Islands), Motunau Island, rock stacks off Banks Peninsula, cliff ledges on Otago Peninsula and nearby Green Island, many islands in Foveaux Strait and around Stewart Island, Mangere Island and at least six smaller islands in the Chatham Islands, the Snares Islands, Antipodes Island and Macquarie Island. They may also breed on islets off Campbell Island. Elsewhere, fairy prions breed on islands off Victoria and Tasmania, Australia, and on islands in the Kerguelen, Crozet, St Paul, Prince Edward, Marion, South Georgia and Falkland archipelagos. Vagrants have been found at the Kermadec Islands, Papua New Guinea, South America and South Africa. They are most often seen over the open sea near breeding colonies, and rarely enter sheltered coastal waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There may be as many as 4 million pairs of fairy prions in the New Zealand region. The largest population is on Stephens Island, with 1.83 million pairs estimated. Other large colonies include Mangere Island (c.40,000 pairs), and 1.5 million pairs were estimated on Green Island, Foveaux Strait in 1941, but few were evident there in 2012. Fairy prions are the most common bird found dead on New Zealand beaches, at an average rate of 0.56 birds per km.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy prions are likely to have bred on many coastal headlands before human arrival in New Zealand. Apart from on a few inaccessible cliff ledges on Otago Peninsula, fairy prions have since been extirpated from the mainland by introduced predators. Their main natural predators at their island breeding sites are subantarctic skuas and swamp harriers. Introductions of feral cats, weka or rats decimated or extirpated fairy prion populations on many muttonbird islands around Stewart Island.</p>\n<p>Few actions specifically targeted at conservation of fairy prions have been undertaken. These included translocation of 240 near fully-grown chicks from Stephens Island to Mana Island during 2002-04 in an attempt to establish a new population, and installation of nest boxes at a cliff-ledge colony on Otago Peninsula. Other more generic island restoration projects (especially pest mammal and weka eradications) have and will benefit fairy prion populations, including on Stephens Island, Mangere Island and on several muttonbird islands near Stewart Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy prions are colonial breeders, nesting in short burrows or rock crevices, mainly on small islands. The breeding season is earlier in the north, with peak laying of the single egg in mid-October at the Poor Knights, and early November on the Snares Islands. Incubation is shared and takes 44-54 days. The chick is left unattended during daylight when only 1-5 days old. One or both parents visit most nights and feed the chick by regurgitation right through to fledging at 43-56 days old. Young birds return to colonies when 2-3 years old, and first breed when 3-4 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy prions often occur in large flocks at sea. They are not attracted to boats. Food items are mainly captured by shallow dives or surface-seizing while hydroplaning &#x2013; facing into the wind with wings extended, and dipping the head and neck into the upper 10 cm of the water column. They are largely non-migratory, staying in New Zealand waters throughout the year. Birds can be found ashore at colonies in any month of the year, though few are present for 1-2 months after breeding (c.March in Cook Strait, April on Snares Islands).</p>\n<p>Fairy prions excavate their own burrows, or utilise caves and rock crevices. They breed as monogamous pairs, which typically remain together over many seasons. Fairy prions visit breeding sites after dark and depart before dawn, or stay in burrows or nest crevices during daylight.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy prions mainly eat small pelagic crustaceans, along with small fish and squid. The small krill species <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em> is by far the predominant species eaten in New Zealand, followed by pelagic amphipods and copepods.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Prion\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Prion</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3918\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3918</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/prionfairy.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/prionfairy.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Craig, E.D. 2010.

It is usually only identifiable in the hand. The species is very similar to the abundant fairy prion but is separable on the basis of its chunkier bill. The specific name <em>crassirostris</em> means &#x2018;thick billed&#x2019; in Latin. The fulmar prion breeds only at five southern island groups. Like most petrels it spends most of its life at sea, but its pelagic distribution is poorly known.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Prions are small petrels. The fulmar prion, like other prions, is blue-grey above with a black &apos;M&apos; marking between the wing tips, a black tail tip and a white supercilium. Underneath it is largely white. Its bill is mainly bluish-grey; its legs and feet are blue with paler webs and greyer claws. Immatures appear similar.</p>\n<p>Of the three subspecies, the Chatham form of fulmar prion is the largest, the lesser fulmar prion is the smallest, and the nominate form is of intermediate size.</p>\n<p>Voice: the fulmar prion is a noisy bird at the nesting colonies both in flight and on the ground, with males giving a four-note call described as <em>what-not-to do</em> and females giving a more slurred, cooing three note call <em>coore-corr-corr</em> . Unlike other prion species, fulmar prions on the Bounty Islands are vocal by day but silent at night.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the fulmar prion is separable from most other prion species by its relatively small body and bill size and its more pronounced black tail tip. However it shares these characteristics with the fairy prion and can usually only be separated from this species in the hand on the basis of its more robust bill and slightly darker tail tip.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The nominate subspecies nests at the Bounty Islands and The Snares (Rima and Toru in the Western Chain); the Chatham Islands subspecies nests on The Pyramid and the Forty-Fours; the lesser fulmar prion nests at the Auckland Islands (Ewing, Ocean and Rose), Heard Island, and probably McDonald Island.</p>\n<p>Fulmar prions are commonly seen offshore from their breeding colonies during the breeding season, and the species may be fairly sedentary around its nesting islands in winter, however little is known about its pelagic range as&#xA0;fulmar prions are difficult to identify at sea. It has been seen in the south Tasman Sea, near Stewart Island, east of the South Island, and well east of the Chatham Islands at 50&#x2DA;S 156&#x2DA;W. Fulmar prions rarely reach mainland New Zealand coasts, and are an extreme vagrant to Tasmania.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total New Zealand population is probably less than 40,000 pairs, including about 30,000 pairs at the Bounty Islands, up to 400-600 pairs at The Snares, 1,000-5,000 pairs at the Chatham Islands, and less than 1,000 pairs at the Auckland Islands. Outside the New Zealand region, more than 10,000 pairs nest at Heard Island.</p>\n<p>At the Bounty Islands the population forms &quot;a subterranean population wherever suitable habitat&quot; occurs (Robertson &amp; van Tets 1982).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The fulmar prion is confined to nesting on offshore islands free of introduced predators. There is no evidence to show that the species formerly had a wider nesting range, although fossil remains have been identified from&#xA0;Chatham and Pitt&#xA0;Islands. Many current nesting sites remain vulnerable to invasion by rats which would have the potential to eliminate populations. Serious pollution incidents, such as oil spills, near breeding sites are also a potential threat. Subantarctic skuas kill some birds on the breeding grounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Fulmar prions breed in dense to loose concentrations; at several sites they breed among nesting albatrosses. The breeding biology has not been studied in detail but it is assumed to be very similar to that of the closely related fairy prion, with a breeding season from October to February. At the Bounty Islands, partly incubated eggs were found on 19 November. At The Snares, eggs have been found from 13 October to 21 November, hatching peaks in mid December, large downy chicks were seen on 19 January, and fledglings probably leave in early February. At the Chatham islands incubation was underway from early to mid December. At Heard Island, eggs have been found from 23 November to 20 December, with hatching estimated to be in late December to early January, and fledglings departing from 17 February for 1 week.</p>\n<p>Nests are normally in natural crevices, rock piles, scree slopes and caves rather than burrows. Like all petrels, only a single egg is laid.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Fulmar prions are unusual among prion species for visiting their nest sites in broad daylight at some colonies (Bounty Islands and The Snares), including performing acrobatic courtship displays and intraspecific fighting on the surface of the colonies. Over the Bounty Islands, flocks will pursue and mob predatory gulls or skuas. However at most colonies (Chatham, Auckland and Heard Islands), fulmar prions are mainly active ashore nocturnally.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Fulmar prions probably catch most of their food close to their breeding islands during the day. They have been seen pecking small items off the sea surface and making brief, shallow dives. Prey consists of a range of small marine invertebrates, varying seasonally, including: crustaceans, juvenile barnacles, salps, pyrosomes, cephalopods and various floating molluscs, and the occasional fish. Chatham Island birds appear to feed mainly on adult barnacles, while birds at The Snares eat mainly crustaceans (euphausiids and amphipods).</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3919\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3919</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Downes, M.C.; Ealey, E.H.M.; Gwynn, A.M.; Young, P.S. 1959.

This macabre task is the easiest way to gain an understanding of the seabirds using New Zealand waters, and every so often someone finds a strikingly rare species. One of these was Bulwer&#x2019;s petrel, a freshly dead specimen of which was found on Te Horo Beach, Horowhenua, in January 1998. This is the only New Zealand record to date.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Bulwer&#x2019;s petrel is a small, sooty-brown petrel, about the size of a prion, but with quite a different shape. It has a long, tapering tail and relatively long, narrow, pointed wings held forward at the carpel joint. Lighter-brown edges to the secondary wing coverts form a pale diagonal band across the upper wing, a feature that is more apparent in good light. The tail looks pointed in normal flight, but is wedge-shaped, a feature only seen clearly when the bird banks and spreads its tail. It has a moderate-sized, smooth black bill with pronounced tubular nostrils. The legs are blackish-pink with dark webs; the iris is dark brown. The flight of Bulwer&#x2019;s petrel is rapid, buoyant and erratic, somewhat bat-like, with loose, wristy, wing-beats. Individuals usually fly close to the sea-surface, especially in strong winds, with short bursts of flapping, while twisting from side to side, interspersed with short, fast glides and quick changes in direction.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice: Bulwer&#x2019;s petrel on their breeding grounds give a deep, chuffing <em>coq coq coq </em>call, about 13-14 notes given in a 10-second period, mixed with occasional double <em>coq-coq</em> notes. They are silent at sea.</p>\n<p>Similar species: this extremely rare vagrant to New Zealand waters is one of several wholly dark-brown or sooty-brown petrels and shearwaters that are easily confused, even by experts, when observed at sea. Observers are forced to rely on subtle differences in the birds&#x2019; flight behaviour and body shape. Bulwer&#x2019;s petrels differ from smaller storm petrels by seldom skimming and pattering the sea-surface, and from slightly larger, dark gadfly petrels, e.g. Kerguelen petrel, by having a distinctly longer tail and by flying close to the sea-surface rather than in high up-and-down arcs. Other dark petrels and shearwaters in New Zealand seas, such as black petrel and sooty, short-tailed, and flesh-footed shearwaters, are all distinctly larger and have proportionately shorter tails. In warmer waters around northern New Zealand beware of both wedge-tailed shearwaters which also has a long pointed tail but is much larger with proportionately bigger and more pointed wings, and the similar-sized brown noddy, especially at a distance. The long bill of the brown noddy makes the head look pointed; its flight is also slower and more relaxed.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Bulwer&#x2019;s petrel is a widely-distributed pan-tropical species outside its mid-year breeding season, with vagrants occurring both north and south of its normal off-season range, including in north-west Australia, the Tasman Sea off Victoria, and one specimen from New Zealand. In the north Atlantic a small population of about 7000-8000 pairs breed on the Azores, Madeira, Canary and Cape Verde Islands. Much larger numbers breed in the north tropical Pacific on numerous islands and stacks along the Hawaiian archipelago (estimated population: 75,000-103,000 pairs) and on islands and islets of southern Japan and south-east China (estimated population on various islands here ranging from 100 to 10,000 pairs). An unknown number also breed on some islands and atolls in south tropical French Polynesia. A few pairs have been found recently nesting on Round Island in the central Indian Ocean and there is a suggestion that some might be breeding on St Helena in the South Atlantic. The species is poorly known outside its main breeding areas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Only one record from New Zealand, a beach-wrecked bird found at Te Horo, north of Waikanae, on 8 January 1998. The specimen is lodged in the bird specimen collection at the Museum of New Zealand/Te Papa Tongarewa (registration number OR.025739).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>On its breeding grounds, Bulwer&#x2019;s petrel is nocturnal, nesting colonially in cavities under rocks or in other holes and crevices during the northern spring. Birds are moderately faithful both to their mate and nest site, about 80% returning to both. Outside the nesting season, birds migrate to tropical waters where they are generally solitary. Bulwer&#x2019;s petrel does not usually follow ships.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Bulwer&#x2019;s petrels consume squid and small fish, occasionally plankton, mostly taken from the sea-surface, although birds are known to make shallow dives down to just over 2 m. There are some suggestions that they feed on prey coming to the sea-surface at night, as the main known prey items are luminescent.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oceanwanderers.com/BulwerPet.html\">http://www.oceanwanderers.com/BulwerPet.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz8LyVMNzr4\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz8LyVMNzr4</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=30&amp;tcid=82\">http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=30&amp;tcid=82</a> (a reference to its occurrence on Round Island, Mauritius)</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Luzardo, J.; L&#xF3;pez-Darias, M.; Su&#xE1;rez, V.; Calabuig, P.; Garc&#xED;a, E.A.; Mart&#xED;n, C. 2008.

It feeds in both small and large groups and scavenges behind fishing vessels. One of the largest <em>Procellaria</em> petrels (equal in size to Westland petrel), white-chinned petrels are large, sooty-black petrels with a varying white patch on the chin or throat, and black legs and feet. White-chinned petrels generally fly low to the water; soaring and gliding like shearwaters up to 10 m above the sea. White-chinned petrels have a circumpolar distribution, breeding on the Antipodes, Auckland, Campbell, Prince Edward and Falkland Islands, South Georgia, Iles Crozet and the Kerguelen group. In New Zealand, white-chinned petrels breed in burrows on Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands. The largest colony is on Disappointment Island (Auckland Islands). Beach-wrecked juvenile white-chinned petrels are often found on the east coasts of New Zealand between November and February.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>White-chinned petrels are large, heavily-built seabirds that are uniform sooty-black with black legs and feet. They have a varying-sized and shaped white patch on the chin or throat; some birds have no white-chin. The bill is large and stout, and pale with black saddle on upper mandible between nostrils and unguis.</p>\n<p>Voice: white-chinned petrels rarely call at sea, but are vocal on the ground during the breeding season.</p>\n<p>Similar species: white-chinned petrels are very similar to Westland petrel and black petrel; apart from overall size (black petrel is smaller) and the absence of white on the chin, both Westland petrel and black petrel have a dark tip to the bill. Flesh-footed shearwaters are one-third smaller and slimmer, with shorter wings and have flesh-coloured legs and feet, and a slimmer pink bill with a dark tip.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>White-chinned petrels breed on Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands in the New Zealand sub-antarctic. During the breeding season, white-chinned petrels occur in waters south and east of New Zealand, feeding over continental-shelf waters up to Cook Strait. During the non-breeding season, white-chinned petrels move northwards into subtropical waters as far as North Cape. Elsewhere, white-chinned petrels breed on Prince Edward and Falkland Islands, South Georgia, Iles Crozet, and the Kerguelen group. They are most often seen at sea, ranging widely over deep water between 30&#xB0; and 65&#xB0;S, and are rarely seen from land away from the breeding islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The largest population of white-chinned petrels in New Zealand is in the Auckland Islands, with 200,000 breeding pairs on Disappointment Island. There are large numbers on Antipodes and lesser numbers on the stacks off Campbell Island. Other populations around the world range up to 750,000 pairs (South Georgia).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>White-chinned petrels have few land-based threats on their New Zealand breeding islands, as all are legally protected island sanctuaries with restricted access. On other island colonies, white-chinned petrels are affected by feral cats and rats. White-chinned petrels have been caught by commercial fishers both in New Zealand waters and overseas and are recognised as at risk from commercial fishing operations.</p>\n<p>Few conservation actions have specifically targeted white-chinned petrels. The Antipodes Island population was studied with population dynamics monitoring and foraging tracking (using geolocator devices) undertaken between 2007 and 2011. Mitigation to reduce seabird bycatch has been put in place on commercial fisheries vessels operating within New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>White-chinned petrels are colonial breeders, nesting in short to long (1-3 m) burrows. Many burrows have waterlogged entrances and tunnels, but the nest is dry on a raised pedestal. White-chinned petrels are monogamous, with shared incubation and chick care. Adults attend the colony from October to May, with a single white egg laid in late November-December. Incubation is shared and takes 57-62 days. Chicks hatch from late January-February and are left unattended during daylight when 5-8 days old. Both parents feed the chick by regurgitation every 1-6 days. Chicks fledge in April- May at 87-106 days old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>White-chinned petrels are usually solitary at sea, but form large flocks around fishing vessels or in association with cetaceans. They are known to follow fishing vessels. White-chinned petrels swim and dive well. White-chinned petrels feed on squid and fish by surface-seizing or shallow diving and also swim underwater using their wings. They are colonial nesters and excavate their own burrows on well-vegetated islands; burrows can have large pools (or moats) of water at the entrances. They breed as monogamous pairs, which typically remain together throughout their breeding lives. White-chinned petrels primarily visit the breeding colonies in late afternoon and circle the colony first. The occasional bird will land in broad daylight, but most arrive on or after dark. They depart before dawn, or stay in burrows during daylight. After breeding, white-chinned petrels migrate northwards to subtropical waters.</p>\n<p>White-chinned petrels are silent at sea, although have been recorded calling when around fishing vessels competing with other birds for discards and offal. They are vocal on the breeding grounds; when at the colony, they have two main calls; &#x2018;Wheezing&#x2019; &#x2013; a wheezy groan used to threaten intruders during territorial disputes, and &#x2018;Rattle&#x2019; &#x2013; loud quacking calls that are repeated frequently just after dark and before dawn. The Rattle call is used mainly by males to attract females to the burrow location, but also in duets between males and females in the burrow. Low, soft &#x2018;Moaning&#x2019; calls have been heard when males and females are bonding in the burrow together or bonding with the chick. A high-pitched &#x2018;Squeal&#x2019; also occurs on Antipodes Island usually in response to threats.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The main food items of white-chinned petrels are squid, salps, fish and crustaceans, although numbers and types of prey items alters during the breeding and non-breeding periods. Squid appears to be the main food item taken in New Zealand. Most food is taken from the surface, by shallow diving on or just above the surface of the water. White-chinned petrels readily take offal and discards from fishing vessels.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-chinned_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-chinned_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/petrelwchinned.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/petrelwchinned.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3922\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3922</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://acap.aq/en/resources/acap-species2/306-white-chinned-petrel/file\">http://acap.aq/en/resources/acap-species2/306-white-chinned-petrel/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Barbraud, C.; Delord, K.; Mareau, C.; Weimerskirch, H. 2009.

The egg is incubated continuously, and the chick, once hatched, is constantly guarded for up to 6 weeks by one or both parents, providing protection from predators during these vulnerable periods. Westland petrels are mostly nocturnal on land, returning to their breeding colonies at dusk, and can be seen rafting in preparation to land along the coast adjacent to the sole breeding colony at Punakaiki. Most birds leave the colony before dawn. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Westland petrel is a large, all-dark petrel. It has a chunky look to it, being large-bodied and with a stout bill, which is pale yellow with a dark tip. The plumage is entirely dark brownish-black, apart from odd white feathers evident in a few individuals. The legs and feet are black. The only other similarly-sized dark petrel in New Zealand waters is the white-chinned petrel.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Voice: Westland petrels produce quacking, humming, and braying sounds on the breeding colony, with a rather nasal sound.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Similar species: white-chinned petrel is the same size and build, but has an entirely straw-coloured bill, without the dark tip. Black petrel is very similar but smaller (700 g) with a less robust bill, and a proportionately smaller head, giving a subtly different silhouette. Flesh-footed shearwater is smaller and more slender still, and has pink legs, and a more slender pinkish bill with a dark tip.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Westland petrels breed under mostly coastal broadleaf forest of coastal ranges near Punakaiki, on the West Coast of the South Island. They are the most common large dark petrel found in Cook Strait, and northern South Island waters in winter, and are often seen from the Cook Strait ferry. During the March to November breeding season, Westland petrels range over shelf waters (&lt;800 m water depth) of the South Island, Cook Strait, and on the Chatham Rise and south to seas around Stewart Island and Fiordland. They are rare north of Cape Egmont and East Cape. A few adults and juveniles are regularly seen off the eastern Australian coast. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Most of the population migrates to western South America in the non-breeding season (austral summer), with some rounding Cape Horn to occur off Argentina; a few may remain in New Zealand waters year-round. Banding recoveries show that juvenile birds occur mostly off southern Peru south to central Chile during their pre-breeding years, whereas adults fly directly towards southern Chile and the Cape Horn area, where they moult. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Westland petrels are confined to a single breeding location (coastal ranges near Punakaiki), where an estimated 4,000 pairs breed annually. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Westland petrel is considered to be stable in numbers, although there is a long history of mortality caused by fisheries. They regularly follow fishing vessels, and are agile divers. In New Zealand waters, Westland petrels have been killed by both tuna longline and trawl fisheries, with females caught more frequently than males. The high degree of overlap of the range of Westland petrels with fisheries indicates that fishery mortality may be underestimated, and they have been ranked among the 10 most likely species to suffer adverse effects of fishing mortality in New Zealand commercial fisheries. Both immatures and adults may also be caught by South American fishing vessels, especially longliners, although there is limited data on this. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Threats also occur on land, with predation by dogs, cats and weka recorded at the breeding colony<em>. </em>Despite the continual presence of ship rats and stoats, there is no strong evidence of small mammals taking Westland petrel eggs, chicks or adults.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Adult Westland petrels flying to and from the breeding colony&#xA0;occasionally collide with power lines, and grounding of adults and fledglings around exposed lights has been recorded by the Department of Conservation. The extent of such mortality associated with built structures remains unreported. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Westland petrels form long-term monogamous pair bonds, with shared incubation and chick-care. The single large (81 x 56 mm) white egg is laid in May or June (peak 23 May) at the end of a 1-2 m long burrow. Incubation takes 57-68 days, with eggs hatching in the last half of July. Chicks are fed by regurgitation, and fledge between early November and mid-January (peak 20 November). Westland petrels can breed from 5-years-old, but 10 years is typical; they may live for more than 37 years. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Westland petrels are solitary at sea when feeding on natural foods, but may feed in mixed flocks when attending fishing vessels to feed on fisheries waste. They feed by surface-seizing and diving.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Breeding Westland petrels consume mainly fish (especially lantern fishes), with a strong component of fisheries waste. Fishing activity within the foraging range includes middle-depth trawl fisheries, for example for hoki and hake, as well as longlining for tuna and ling. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/westland-petrel-taiko/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/westland-petrel-taiko/</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/about-doc/news/meet-the-locals-videos/second-series/westland-petrels/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/about-doc/news/meet-the-locals-videos/second-series/westland-petrels/</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/316-westland-petrel/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/316-westland-petrel/file</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3924\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3924</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/petrelwestland.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/petrelwestland.html</a></p>\n<p>For at-sea identification see: <a href=\"http://wwwmhc.aba.org/birding/v38n6p52.pdf\">http://wwwmhc.aba.org/birding/v38n6p52.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p align=\"left\">ACAP 2012.

Generally solitary at sea, it often feeds in small groups associated with dolphins and whales or following fishing vessels. The smallest of the <em>Procellaria</em> group, it is a medium-sized, uniformly black, stocky bird with black legs and feet and a yellowish bill with a grey/black tip. Black petrels usually fly just above the water, but can soar much higher. They breed in burrows on Great Barrier Island (Aotea) and Hauturu/Little Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf. The largest colony is on Great Barrier Island which holds an estimated 2000 breeding pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Black petrels are medium-sized, uniformly black petrels, with black legs and feet and a yellowish bill with a grey/black tip and black between the plates. They are the smallest of the <em>Procellaria</em> petrels. They occasionally show white feathers under the chin or on the head.</p>\n<p>Voice: black petrels rarely call at sea, but are vocal on the ground or approaching the colony at night during the breeding season.</p>\n<p>Similar species: black petrels are very similar to white-chinned petrel and Westland petrel, which are both larger, bulkier birds with more robust bills. White-chinned petrel also differs in having a straw-coloured bill (no black tip) and (usually) white under the chin. Flesh-footed shearwater commonly occurs alongside black petrels and is smaller, less bulky, with shorter wings, flesh-coloured legs and feet, and a pinkish bill with a dark tip.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black petrels breed on Great Barrier Island (Aotea) and Hauturu/Little Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf, Auckland. They are most often seen in the outer Hauraki Gulf or in pelagic waters near continental shelf breaks or sea mounts. During the breeding season, black petrels occur in subtropical waters around New Zealand, eastern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Black petrels migrate to South American waters during the non-breeding period, congregating in offshore and pelagic waters off Ecuador. During the non-breeding season, black petrels have been reported off the coasts of Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico and Galapagos.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The largest population of black petrels is on Great Barrier Island (Aotea), with 1,000 breeding pairs estimated and 1,000 non-breeding birds. The Hauturu/Little Barrier Island colony is estimated at 100 breeding pairs. At-sea counts have estimated 38,000 black petrels present in eastern tropical Pacific waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Black petrels formerly bred throughout the North Island and northwest Nelson, but have been extirpated from mainland New Zealand due to the introduction of feral cats, feral pigs, mustelids and rats. The colony on Hauturu/Little Barrier Island has no land-based threats (apart from fire) as this is a legally protected, predator-free island sanctuary with restricted access. There are feral pigs, feral cats, ship rats and kiore on Great Barrier Island (Aotea), most of which have been recorded at the main breeding colony on Mount Hobson/Hirakimata. Black petrels have been caught by commercial and recreational fishers both in New Zealand and overseas and are recognised as the most at-risk seabird in New Zealand from commercial fishing.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Few conservation actions have specifically targeted black petrels. A translocation of 100 juveniles from Great Barrier Island (Aotea) to Hauturu/Little Barrier Island occurred in 1989 and 1990, but with limited success. The Great Barrier Island (Aotea) population has been intensively monitored since 1995. Mitigation to reduce seabird bycatch has been put in place on commercial fisheries vessels operating within New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Black petrels are colonial breeders, nesting in short to medium (0.5-3 m) burrows on Great Barrier Island (Aotea) and Hauturu/Little Barrier Island. They are monogamous, with shared incubation and chick care. Black petrels attend the colony from October to July, with a single egg laid from mid-November to late January. Incubation is shared and takes 57 days. Chicks are left unattended during daylight when 3-7 days old. One or both parents visit every 2-3 nights and feed the chick by regurgitation through to fledging at 96 to 122 days old. Young birds return to the colonies when 4-6 years old and first breed when 5-7 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black petrels are generally solitary at sea, but sometimes form flocks around fishing vessels or in association with cetaceans. They characteristically feed by surface feeding and shallow diving at night. Black petrels excavate their own burrows, or utilise caves, hollow logs and cavities under banks and bases of trees. They breed as monogamous pairs, which typically remain together throughout their breeding lives. Black petrels visit the breeding colonies after dark and depart before dawn, or stay in burrows during daylight. After breeding, they migrate to South America, staying in eastern tropical Pacific waters from July to October.</p>\n<p>Black petrels rarely call at sea, but are vocal on the ground or approaching the colony at night during the breeding season. When on the ground at the colony, males have a loud, harsh, far-carrying call described as a &#x2018;Clack&#x2019;; this repeated call peaks just after dark and before dawn and appears to be used to attract females to the burrow location. Females have an &#x2018;Aerial&#x2019; call; usually on approach to and above the colony. On the ground, both birds have &#x2018;Squawk&#x2019; call when threatened or during territorial disputes and &#x2018;Crooning&#x2019; calls when males and females are bonding in the burrow together or bonding with the chick.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black petrels feed predominately at night on bioluminescent squid (particularly Ommastrephidae, Histioteuthidae and Cranchidae) supplemented by fish, tunicates, crustaceans and cyclostomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/blackpetrel.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/blackpetrel.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3923\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3923</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://acap.aq/en/resources/acap-species2/291-black-petrel/file\">http://acap.aq/en/resources/acap-species2/291-black-petrel/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bell, E.A.; Sim, J.L.&#xA0; 1998a<em>.</em> Survey and monitoring of black petrels on Great Barrier Island 1996. <em>&#xA0;Science for Conservation: 77</em>.&#xA0; Department of Conservation, Wellington.</p>\n<p>Bell, E.A.; Sim, J.L.&#xA0; 1998b.&#xA0; Survey and monitoring of black petrels on Great BarrierIsland1997.&#xA0; <em>Science for Conservation 78</em>.&#xA0; Department of Conservation, Wellington.</p>\n<p>Bell, E.A.; Sim, J.L.&#xA0; 2000a.&#xA0; Survey and monitoring of black petrels on Great Barrier Island 1997/98.<em>&#xA0; </em>Published client report on contract 3085, funded by Conservation Services Levy.

Juveniles resemble adults, but have dark brown-black plumage. Little black shags are similar in size to little shags, but they lack any white plumage and have a relatively short tail. They are much smaller than black shags. Little black shags occur in harbours, lakes, estuaries and coastal inlets. They are gregarious when feeding and roosting, and are the only New Zealand shag species that routinely forages co-operatively in flocks. They fly strongly, close to the water and in a V formation, the wings sometimes almost touching. They occur mostly in the North Island and disperse in autumn to feed and roost in tight-knit flocks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little black shags have sleek, all-black plumage with a dark green glossy sheen on the upper wings apparent in good light. They have dark facial skin, a thin black to dark grey bill and black legs and feet. The iris is bright green, and there are bluish-green tubercles around the eye. Small nuptial plumes develop during courtship but these are lost during breeding. Males and females are identical. Juveniles have dark brownish-black plumage, and chicks have yellowish bills. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little black shags are smaller than black shags and they are often seen in flocks of a few birds to about 100, occasionally more. They breed in colonies in trees overhanging water, and sometimes on the ground on small islands. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: little black shags are quiet except when breeding, when males utter a variety of throaty croaks and whistles.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: many juvenile little shags are completely dark, but they differ from little black shags in having stubby yellow bills and relatively longer tails. Black shags are much larger, and usually have yellow facial skin; breeding adults have a white flank patch that is never present on little black shags. The little black shag has a much brighter green eye than either species, if seen at sufficiently close range.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little black shags are thought to be a relatively new species in New Zealand and their distribution is increasing. They mainly occur in the North Island, particularly in Northland, Rotorua, Taupo, Wairarapa and Wellington. They are increasingly being reported in the South Island. Little black shags occur mostly on harbours and lakes, but also occur on braided rivers, and muddy edges of inland and coastal inlets, lakes and ponds, including sewerage ponds. Vagrant to Stewart Island (2011) and Snares Islands (2013).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unknown but probably slowly increasing and may number several thousands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Foraging adults are at risk from entanglement in unattended set nets, which potentially could ensnare an entire feeding flock. Predators may take some eggs and chicks, but this has not been studied.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little black shags breed colonially between late October and December, sometimes nesting with other shag species. The nest is an open platform of sticks and twigs, lined with leaves and grass, in trees overhanging fresh water. The 2-5 (typically 4) pale bluish-green eggs are laid 2 days apart.&#xA0; It is thought that both sexes share nest building, incubation and protecting chicks. The incubation period is unknown. Young are naked at hatching. Juvenile plumage is dark brown with slight scalloping appearing with age.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little black shags are highly gregarious species, especially after breeding although birds are also seen singly or in small groups. Conspicuous flocks of up to 100 birds (sometimes more) feed, roost and travel together at estuaries, lakes and rivers. They forage co-operatively, herding and encircling shoals of small fish. Birds feed throughout the day but rest at times on rocks, shingle, or river banks or mudflats. Roosting is in flocks in trees or on rocky outcrops on the shoreline. At Lake Rotoiti, near Rotorua, little black shags&#xA0;use a diversion wall in the lake for nesting, roosting and as a sentinel position for fishing. Little black shags are strong fliers, usually just above the water surface and often in a V formation. Males display a variety of mate-attraction and territorial displays at or near the nest, including wing-waving, gargling, pointing, kink-throating and hopping.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little black shags mainly consume small fish caught in fresh or marine environments.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Black_Cormorant\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Black_Cormorant</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/littleblackshag.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/littleblackshag.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Buchler, M.P. 1978.

Subfossil bone deposits indicate two regional haplogroups, from the Cook Strait region and northern North Island. However, king shags have been confined to the outer Marlborough Sounds for at least 240 years. European naturalists first encountered king shags when J.R. Forster collected one in Queen Charlotte Sound during Captain Cook&#x2019;s second visit to New Zealand, in May 1773.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">The king shag is a large black-and-white shag with big pink feet. The black feathers on forehead, crown and nape extend to just under the bill, making king shags appear &#x2018;dark-headed&#x2019; compared to the similar-sized pied shag. The dorsal area of mantle, scapulars, back and tail are black apart from adults, which have a white patch or stripe near the leading edge of the inner wing. Some birds also have a white patch on the upper back. The white scapular feathers are prominent on roosting birds, creating an elongated white patch in the middle of the otherwise black folded wing. Breeding adults have a patch of sulphur-yellow warty &#x2018;caruncles&#x2019; on each side of the upper bill base; the size and colour intensity of these is reduced at other times of the year. The cobalt blue eye-ring (not part of the eye) is shared with other pink-footed &#x2018;subantarctic&#x2019; shags, providing this group with the generic, but technically incorrect name &quot;blue-eyed shags&quot;. Juvenile birds differ from the adults in having dull brown upper parts (rather than black) and pale facial skin.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Voice: croaking bursts of low frequency sounds, more noticeable during the early morning.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Similar species: pied shags are similar in size, but have a predominantly white face, with the eye surrounded by white feathers; they also lack any white feathers on the upper wings and back. Pied shags are also slimmer, compared to the thick-necked look of king shags. Pied morph Stewart Island shags are very similar, but are not known to overlap in range. They differ in having a more slender bill and orange (cf. yellow) caruncles when breeding.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">King shags are restricted to the outer Marlborough Sounds, from the west coast of D&#x2019;Urville Island east to where Queen Charlotte Sound and Cook Strait meet. About 85% of all existing birds are located at five colonies: Rahuinui Island, Duffers Reef, Trio Islands, Sentinel Rock and White Rocks. The area occupied is defined by the distance and direction from the colonies and the water depth contour. The shags feed up to 25 km in a predominantly southwest direction from the main colonies, mainly in waters up to 50 m deep (but diving in deeper waters has been recorded). The foraging area of king shag is estimated to be 1300 km2. Away from the Marlborough Sounds, there are records of single king shags from Wellington Harbour (July 2002), and Kaikoura (October 2011). In 2015 and 2016 seven individual king shags, mostly 1st and 2nd year birds, were recorded from Abel Tasman National Park. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">King shags breed on low rock plateaus (Duffers Reef and Stewart Island/Tekuru Kuru), steep rock faces (Trio Islands and White Rock) or rock ridges (Sentinel Rock and Rahuinui Island). King shags breed between 2 and 33 m above sea level, with 80% of the population breeding lower than 14 m above sea-level.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">The king shag population was assessed to be 839 birds (including 187 pairs) based on aerial surveys in 2015. Although the status of the king shag has been assessed to be stable, this is based on limited data. A 2016 survey showed a more than 37% decline in active breeding pairs compared to 2015.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">The restricted distribution and small population size of king shags means that a single adverse event, such as an oil spill, could impact most of the population. Other risks include coastal eutrophication through multiple anthropogenic stressors (e.g. aquaculture, forestry and riverine nitrogen inputs) impacting the deep benthic communities where the shags feed, and/or causing toxic algal blooms that may directly or indirectly kill individuals. Adverse weather events may also have an effect on king shags. &#xA0;The loss of 58% of nests at White Rocks in June 2015 was very likely caused by exposure to southerly storms. It is not known whether king shags lay replacement clutches. King shags are vulnerable to disturbance at their colonies, and use of set-nets (particularly in close proximity to colonies).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Most king shag breeding activity occurs during winter. Nests are platforms of sticks and seaweed, cemented with guano. The 1-3 pale blue eggs are usually laid in May-June. There is no information on incubation length or nestling period, but juveniles are present at colonies from July onwards. Adults (likely females) feeding chicks depart colonies at sunrise, arriving back at the colony about midday. A second departure happens short after midday (likely males).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">King shags are difficult to study due to their inaccessible breeding sites and sensitivity to disturbance. Most studies have been boat-based, looking at patterns of bird movements to and from colonies, and activity of king shags around marine farms. A low number of pairs attempt to breed each year, and so it is possible that not all birds are annual breeders.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">King shags are deep divers, feeding on bottom-dwelling fish species. About 90% of feeding birds are recorded foraging in water depths down to 50 m. Prey species for king shag reported up to 2003 were: witch (<em>Arnoglossus scapha)</em>, opalfish (<em>Hemerocoetes sp</em>), lemon sole (<em>Pelotretis flavilatus</em>), other sole species (<em>Peltorhamphus </em>sp.), flounder, (<em>Rhombosolea </em>sp.), leatherjacket (<em>Parika scaber</em>), blue cod (<em>Parapercis colias</em>), sea perch (<em>Helicolenus percoides</em>), red cod (<em>Pseudophycis bachus</em>), red scorpionfish (<em>Scorpaena papillosus</em>), pilchard (<em>Sardinops neopilchardus</em>), New Zealand sole (<em>Peltoramphus novaeseelandiae</em>), sandfish (<em>Gonorhynchus gonorhynchus</em>), triplefins (Tripteriigydae) and &#xA0;spotty (<em>Notolabrus celidotus</em>). The predominant prey in a more comprehensive 2011 study were: witch, lemon sole and opalfish. Dwarf octopus (<em>Octopus</em> sp.) was recorded as new prey species in 2011. </p>\n<p>All the preferred prey items are bottom-dwelling species, highlighting the king shag&#x2019;s deep diving abilities and dependence on a healthy benthic environment in the deeper waters of the Marlborough Sounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-faced_Shag\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-faced_Shag</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3689\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3689</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kingshag.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kingshag.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bell, M.&#xA0;2010.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/numbers-and-distribution-new-zealand-king-shag-leucocarbo-carunculatus-colonies-marlborough-sounds-s\">Numbers and distribution of New Zealand king shag (<em>Leucocarbo carunculatus</em>) colonies in the Marlborough Sounds, September-December 2006</a>.&#xA0;<em>Notornis 57</em>: 33-36.</p>\n<p>Brown, D.&#xA0;2001.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/dive-duration-and-some-diving-rhythms-new-zealand-king-shag-leucocarbo-carunculatus\"><em>Dive duration and some diving rhythms of the New Zealand king shag (Leucocarbo carunculatus</em>)</a>.&#xA0;<em>Notornis 48</em>: 177-178</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Falla, R.A. 1933.

The pied morph has striking black-and-white plumage, whilst the bronze form appears dark brown, but is iridescent in the right lighting conditions. On Otago Harbour and in Foveaux Strait, Stewart Island shags are seen in &#x2018;line astern&#x2019; squadrons heading to and from foraging grounds. The flocking behaviour, heavy build and flight close to the water is diagnostic. The habit of group foraging in murky water places Stewart Island shags at risk from set-net entanglement.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Stewart Island shag is a large pink-footed shag of southern New Zealand. The pied morph has a dark head and white belly and throat, with white patches on the otherwise black wings. These appear as a white bar when the wings are folded. The back feathers are black with a blue sheen, and the tail is black. The bronze morph is entirely brownish-black, with a green sheen on the wings and blue sheen on the body. The bill is pale brown, pink or grey with a dark culmen ridge; the iris is brown. In breeding plumage both forms have orange caruncles above the base of the bill, and purplish facial skin (cf. yellow caruncles on king shags). Non-breeding birds are similar, but have duller facial skin colour and no crests. Juveniles are also dimorphic (i.e. pied or bronze) but are duller with pale facial skin and no caruncles. There is a marked cline in size from south to north, with Stewart Island birds small, and Otago birds large.</p>\n<p>Voice: only reported at breeding colonies. When seeking a mate, males use a <em>borr</em>&#xA0;call. Males returning to the nest call with a soft <em>eh-eh-eh</em>; females remain silent. Chicks beg for food with a squeaky <em>ah-whee-ah.</em></p>\n<p>Similar species: around southern New Zealand, the pied morph may be confused with the similarly-sized pied shag, and the bronze morph may be confused with the black shag. Both pied and black shags have black feet and fly with an S-shaped neck. Pied shags have more white on their face, and lack white patches on their upperwings. Pied and black shags are more likely to perch in trees, whereas Stewart Island shags do not. Ways to separate pied morph birds from either king shag or Chatham Island shag are poorly understood. This has been problematic for extra-limital sightings of pied, pink-footed shags at Godley Head, Banks Peninsula, and at Kaikoura. Were they Stewart Island shags or New Zealand king shags?</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Stewart Island shags occur from southern Stewart Island and outliers in the south, west as Te Wae Wae Bay, and north to the Waitaki River. There are two recent sightings of bronze morph birds at Lake Ellesmere. Numbers of nesting habitats in Otago have increased in recent years. It is not known whether this is an overall increase in numbers, or movement out of the southern part of the range. </p>\n<p>Stewart Island shags are birds of coastal waters and harbours. They are recorded regularly in the middle of Foveaux Strait. They roost on headlands, small islands and on man-made structures. </p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Estimates vary between 1600-1800 pairs, to fewer than 5000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Stewart Island shags are at risk from fishing interactions, particularly entanglement in set-nets, but occasionally by being shot (illegally) by fishers. Other threats include disturbance at nesting colonies. In Otago, all large successful breeding colonies are either islands or protected areas. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Stewart Island shags are colonial nesters in both small and large colonies, on rocky cliffs or bluffs. The pedestal nests are made of seaweed, sticks and grass cemented with guano. Each nest is just out of pecking reach of the next nest. Nest material is often stolen from unguarded nests. Colonies may persist for many years, or be suddenly abandoned. Breeding seasons may vary between years and between colonies. Stewart Island shag breeding behaviour and ecology has not been well studied. The 1-3 eggs are laid from September to November. Breeders are probably monogamous, and share incubation. Chicks are mainly fed in the afternoon, and beg for food with a squeaky call from one week old. They breed from three-years-old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Stewart Island shags may roost in large flocks on headlands or man-made structures (e.g. the wharf at Oamaru). Flocks flying to or from feeding grounds fly in long lines close to the water. They have been recorded foraging up to 10 km off the Otago coast. </p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Stewart Island shags forage in groups, in water up to 30 m. They are able to successfully forage in murky water such as in the inner Otago Harbour. In such conditions the foraging strategy is based on &#x2018;disturb and strike&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;see and chase&#x2019;. The diet is mainly seabed-dwelling fish (Otago Harbour 70% by weight) such as flounder and bullies. Invertebrates such as crabs, shrimps and polychaete worms are also taken. The diet varies seasonally, with fish making up more in spring (85% by weight) and less in winter (45% by weight).</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ebird.org/ebird/newzealand/map/brosha1?neg=true&amp;env.minX=&amp;env.minY=&amp;env.maxX=&amp;env.maxY=&amp;zh=false&amp;gp=false&amp;mr=1-12&amp;bmo=1&amp;emo=12&amp;yr=1900-2012&amp;byr=1900&amp;eyr=2012\">http://ebird.org/ebird/newzealand/map/brosha1?neg=true&amp;env.minX=&amp;env.minY=&amp;env.maxX=&amp;env.maxY=&amp;zh=false&amp;gp=false&amp;mr=1-12&amp;bmo=1&amp;emo=12&amp;yr=1900-2012&amp;byr=1900&amp;eyr=2012</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/shagstewartisland.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/shagstewartisland.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Crossland, A.C. 2012.

It is the only large black-and-white shag in the island group. Despite their declining population, Chatham Island shags can still readily be found roosting on headlands along the rocky coast line. They are entirely marine, dispersing from colonies and roost sites to forage in coastal waters and within parts of the brackish Te Whanga Lagoon. During breeding, compact colonies form on rocky headlands and offshore islets located throughout the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The only large black-and-white shag, and the only one with pink feet, found in the Chatham Islands. Adult Chatham Island shags have a black head, hind neck and back, with white patches on the wings that appear as a white bar when the wing is folded. The chin, throat, breast and under wing are white. In flight, they have a white bar on the inner part of the upper wing, and another white patch on the back. The head is held lower than the body when flying. During the breeding season, the facial skin is dark purple with prominent orange-red caruncles above the base of the bill; this colour fades outside the breeding season.

Colonies and roost sites are situated on exposed rocky coastal headlands or offshore islets. The Chatham Island shag is a marine feeder and is typically found foraging in coastal and inshore waters usually within a few kilometres of shore. One colony is found within the brackish Te Whanga Lagoon, where birds also forage within the southern deeper portion of the lagoon.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Chatham Island shag population has undergone significant decline in the past 15 years. In 1997 the breeding population was 842 pairs, but had declined to 355 pairs in 2011. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Populations of Chatham Island shag are threatened by loss of breeding habitat, disturbance from stock, human persecution, introduced predators, and gull predation. However, given that population declines have been recorded at colonies on remote predator-free offshore islands, it is likely that some type of at-sea effects are impacting on the population. There has been no direct conservation management action to benefit Chatham Island shag other than co-ordinated island-wide population censuses. The recent increase in fencing coastal habitats on the Chatham Islands will prevent stock from gaining access to some colonies, thereby reducing disturbance.The conservation status of this species was changed from nationally endangered to nationally critical.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chatham Island shags are colonial breeders, forming densely-packed colonies of 5 to 350 pairs. Colonies are found on exposed rocky headlands or offshore islets. Laying is mostly from October to December, but there is much variation both between and within colonies. Birds in the colony in Te Whanga Lagoon breed 3 months earlier than those in other colonies. Little is known about breeding biology. The 2-4 eggs are incubated for about 30 days, with chicks fledging in 4-6 weeks. Birds probably start breeding when three years old.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chatham Island shags gather in small to medium-sized flocks when roosting, but usually feed solitarily. Birds swim on the surface, diving to forage underwater for small fish. Chatham Island shags are non-migratory, remaining within coastal Chatham Island waters throughout the year.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The diet is mostly small fish (&lt;25cm long), especially flatfish, opalfish and bullies, along with occasional squid, cuttlefish and octopus.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3691\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3691</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/shagchatham.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/shagchatham.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Aikman, H.; Miskelly, C. 2004. <em>Birds of the Chatham Islands</em>.

They are part of the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands World Heritage Area. At only 135 hectares, they are the smallest archipelago within the group, and are located 624 km east of Bluff at 47&#xB0;45&apos;S 170&#xB0;02&apos;E. Their name is a misnomer, as the islands are barren granite outcrops, devoid of soil and&#xA0;plants, apart from lichens, green algae and a few tufts of cress. But what they lack in plant cover is more than made up for with teeming populations of breeding fur seals and seabirds, principally Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks, erect-crested penguins and fulmar prions. The Bounty Island shag is endemic to the islands and is the only shag present there.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Adult Bounty Island shags are black with a blue sheen above, and white below, although the white belly is often heavily stained by nest material. The upper wing-coverts are dark brownish-black with a green sheen. White &#x2018;alar&#x2019; patches are present on the upper wings of most individuals, and are visible in flight and at rest, appearing as a white patch on the otherwise dark upper-wing. Some males also have white patches on their backs. The slender, hooked bill is brown or pink with a dark ridge and lighter tip. The skin at the base of the bill and gape are orange-yellow and the gular pouch red-orange and/or purple. The iris is light brown. A single crest develops in the breeding season. The feet are pink with variable amounts of grey on the tarsi and toes. Sexes are alike but the males are slightly larger. Juveniles are distinguished by having brown rather than black on the upper parts, and pale facial skin.</p>\n<p>Voice: resting males give soft purring and ticking sounds. Females are silent at rest and make soft purring during mating.</p>\n<p>Similar species: no other shag species have been recorded from the Bounty Island. If individuals were to stray to other subantarctic islands, they would most likely be confused with the similar Auckland Island shag, which has a narrower white throat stripe and (in breeding plumage) brighter and more varied facial skin colouring.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Bounty Island shags are restricted to the Bounty Islands and surrounding inshore seas. The only record away from the Bounty Islands was two on Bollons Island in the Antipodes Island group in November 1950. A published sighting at the Snares Islands was a misidentification of an Auckland Island shag.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>Population censuses of mature individuals have been periodically undertaken and show considerable variation, although whether this variation reflects true changes in population size or is related to other factors such as survey methodology or timing is uncertain. In 1978 there were 1,138 adults, with 368 counted in 1997, and 618 in 2005. A 2011 survey suggested that the population had remained stable since 2005.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Bounty Island shags are confined to breeding on a few ledges on cliff faces due to intense competition for breeding space with fur seals, mollymawks and penguins. Subantarctic skuas and southern black-backed gulls are likely to take some eggs and chicks, but the greatest threat to Bounty Island shags is the weather. The tiny Bounty Islands offer little protection from severe storms, which cause chick losses through hypothermia or being blown or swept from exposed nests, or their starvation if storms prevent adults foraging. The conservation status of this species was moved from Nationally Endangered to Naturally Uncommon in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Bounty Island shags nest colonially on narrow cliff ledges or alcoves and occasionally on skyline ridges throughout the archipelago. Breeding commences in October when males occupy and defend suitable nesting sites, and display to females. Females choose suitable males and build the nest from material mainly supplied by her mate. Nests are built from the brown alga <em>Marginarilla</em>, which the male dives for, and feathers, stones, debris, and mud. Nests are 35 cm wide and 15 cm high and their centres are about a metre apart. Both males and females continue to display on the nest by drooping their wings and exposing their backs, up until the 2-3 eggs are laid. Both sexes incubate, with females leaving to forage shortly after dawn, returning in the middle of the day to relieve the male, who forages during the afternoon. Incubation changeover is accompanied by recognition displays including forward gaping and nest worrying. The male often regurgitates pellets of food waste and pebbles at this time, and dives to collect material to augment the nest. Males may accompany these recognition displays with soft vocalisations. Eggs are thought to hatch in late November and December.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Bounty Island shags are restricted to inshore waters around the islands and sometimes form large foraging flocks. Like other pink-footed shag species, they do not spread their wings to dry. Males perform elaborate courtship displays, including &#x2018;gargling&#x2019; with an upright body stance, swinging the head back until the crown touches the rump. This is accompanied by bill opening, a raised tail, and drooped wings.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Analysis of regurgitated pellets revealed a varied diet of small fish and squid, snails, and sea urchins, indicating that Bounty Island shags forage on the seabed.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22696876/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22696876/0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3693\">www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3693</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.

Found only in the Auckland Islands, it is the only resident shag there, occurring on Auckland, Adams, Enderby, Disappointment, Ewing, Dundas and Green Islands. The Auckland Islands (Motu Maha or Maungahuka) are part of the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands World Heritage Area. The islands are the largest of New Zealand&apos;s subantarctic islands, with a combined land area of 625 km2. They lie 465 km south of Bluff, between latitudes 50&#xB0; 30&apos; and 50&#xB0; 55&apos; S and longitudes 165&#xB0; 50&apos; and 166&#xB0; 20&apos; E.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Auckland Island shag is a medium-sized, black-and-white marine shag. The black plumage on the head and neck has a metallic green and blue sheen in sunlight, contrasting with the white throat and underparts, and pale pink feet. During the breeding season Auckland Island shags have a tall, black, recurved head crest, magenta-pink eye ring, red facial skin, and red-orange to purple throat pouch. It lacks the caruncles above the bill base that are found in the three northernmost pink-footed shag species, but does have orange-yellow rough skin at the bill base and along the gape. The iris is light brown. The long bill has a dark ridge, grading from brown to pale pink at the hooked tip. White patches on upper wings vary from prominent to absent; some males have a white patch on the back. Non-breeding adults lack crests, and the black plumage fades to brown. Juveniles are distinguished by brown facial skin and upperparts. Sexes are alike in plumage but males are slightly larger than females and differ in their calls and courtship behaviour.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: during courtship displays the male barks and makes ticking sounds while the female purrs or puffs softly. They are silent elsewhere.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the only pink-footed shag that occurs at the Auckland Islands. The identity of any pink-footed shag seen at the Snares or Antipodes Islands needs to be carefully considered. Four similar species are possible as a vagrant: Auckland Island, Campbell Island, Bounty Island and Stewart Island shags. Auckland Island and Campbell Island shags are both 63 cm.&#xA0;Campbell Island shags all have dark throats, with a separate white chin patch. Auckland Island shags vary from being identical to Campbell Island shags to having&#xA0;a&#xA0;white medial strip of variable width connecting the white chin to the breast. The Bounty Island shag is large (71 cm), has an even whiter throat, and more extensive white alar patches on the upper wings. Pied morph Stewart Island shag is 68 cm and has orange caruncles above the base of the bill when in breeding condition. Little shag and black shag have both been recorded as vagrant at the Auckland Islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Auckland Island shags are restricted to the Auckland Islands and shallow nearby waters. They mainly inhabit the sheltered harbours and inlets of the eastern and southern coasts, plus Port Ross in the north. Colonies are known from Auckland, Enderby, Rose, Ewing and Adams Islands, and Sugar Loaf Rocks (near Disappointment Island). They forage up to 24 km offshore. The only bird recorded away from the Auckland Islands arrived as a juvenile on the Snares Islands, 280 km to the north, in 1994 and was resident there for&#xA0;8 years, during which time it gained adult plumage.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Surveys counted 1,138 adults in 1978, 368 adults in 1997, and 618 adults in 2005. Results of a boat-based survey at Enderby Island in 2011 counted 1,366 active nests in 10 colonies. Based on these data, a population of c.3000 mature individuals has been estimated at Enderby. More data for colonies at other islands is needed. On the basis of the estimated number of mature individuals it is assumed there are c.4500 individuals in total.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This species is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN because it has a very small range and is susceptible to stochastic events and human impacts. Population trends are unknown, but the population is assumed to be stable following the elimination of most but not all feral mammalian predators at the islands. The Department of Conservation lists it as Nationally Vulnerable B (1/1). The subantarctic skua and southern black-backed gull both prey on shag eggs and chicks. The weather poses a greater threat, with storms during chick rearing causing the direct loss of chicks from exposed nests, or chick starvation resulting from interrupted adult foraging. On the main Auckland Island, the major threat is from feral pigs which destroy any shag colony they can reach. As a result, most colonies are now in inaccessible places. Feral cats are also potential predators on Auckland Island. On Enderby Island, feral cattle (since removed) eliminated a tussock species used elsewhere as a favoured nesting material.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Auckland Island shags breed from November to February in colonies on cliff tops, rock ledges and alcoves, often under an overhang or trees to give protection from predatory skuas. Nests are situated at least 75 cm apart. Auckland Island shags are monogamous. The 3 pale blue eggs (62 x 39 mm) are laid November-February in a large flattened bowl of twigs, tussock, seaweed and guano. Both sexes share in incubation (c.28 days) and chick-rearing. The fledging period is unknown. Two chicks are usually raised.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Elaborate male display includes gargling, gaping, bowing, kink-throating, penguin-walking, and various other body postures. Mated birds greet by moving their wide-open bills back and forth in front of their pulsating breast. Females forage shortly after dawn during the breeding season, returning in the middle of the day to relieve the male bird, which then departs to forage during the afternoon and returns before dusk. Incubation changeover is accompanied by nest material gathering and regurgitation of a pellet of food remains.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Auckland Island shags roost and nest colonially on rock ledges and on the tops of steep cliffs. Nest sites are abandoned if sheltering plants are killed by guano; tide waves sometimes destroy nests. They sometimes feed in flocks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Regurgitated pellets revealed that Auckland Island shags eat small fish, squid, marine snails and sea urchins, with most food items taken from the sea-bed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3692\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3692</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Harrison, P. 1987. <em>Seabirds of the world: a photographic guide</em>.

Population trends are unknown, but are assumed to be more or less stable. The Department of Conservation lists it as At Risk / Naturally Uncommon.</p>\n<p>Campbell Island (Motu Ihupuku) is the main island of the Campbell Island group. Part of the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands World Heritage Area, the main island covers 112 square km of the group&apos;s 113 square km, and is surrounded by various stacks, rocks and islets, including Dent, Folly and Jacquemart Islands (the latter island is the southernmost in New Zealand).&#xA0;Lying 700 km south of Bluff, the islands are located between latitudes 52&#xB0;32.4&#x2032;S and longitudes 169&#xB0;8.7&#x2032;E. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Campbell Island shag is a medium-sized, black-and-white marine shag. The black plumage on the head, neck and throat has a metallic green and blue sheen in sunlight, contrasting the white chin and underparts, and pale pink feet. During the breeding season it has a tall, black, recurved head crest and prominent dark purple to reddish-orange facial skin and throat pouch. It lacks the facial caruncles and blue eye-ring of the three northernmost pink-footed shag species, but has a prominent yellow line above the gape, and a yellow spot below it that grades to red. The iris is dark brown, and the long dark brown-grey bill grades to pale pink-orange at the hooked tip. White patches on the upper wings may be prominent, reduced or absent. Non-breeding adults lack a crest, and the black plumage fades to brown. Juveniles have dull brown plumage, dull purple-brown facial skin, and a dull yellow-orange throat pouch. Sexes are alike in plumage but&#xA0;differ in their calls and courtship behaviour. They fly with the head held below the body. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: males bark during courtship displays. They are silent away from breeding colonies.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: none within its range as it is the only shag that is regularly present at Campbell Island (little shag and black shag occur as vagrants). The related, similar Auckland Island shag has continuous white from the chin and throat to the breast, a magenta-pink eye-ring, red facial skin, and a red-orange to purple throat pouch.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Campbell Island shag is restricted to Campbell Island and adjacent coastal waters. Birds are mostly seen in the sheltered harbours and inlets of the east and south coast, especially in winter, but they also forage at sea within 10 km of the main island. They often rest on intertidal rocks and coastal headlands after foraging. The only possible record of a Campbell Island shag away from the Campbell Island group is a specimen in Otago Museum labelled as being from the Antipodes Islands. This is possibly the shag that Andreas Reischek reported as being present during his visit to Antipodes Island in February 1888.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1975 the population of Campbell Island shags was estimated at c.2000 pairs and 8000 individual birds. However, the breeding season may be quite prolonged and staggered between colonies, and so this census may have underestimated the number of pairs. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Campbell Island shag population is thought to be stable. Norway rats were eradicated from Campbell Island in 2001, and feral cats died out in the late 1980s, leaving the island group free of introduced predators. Subantarctic skuas take some shag eggs and chicks, but are unlikely to limit breeding success.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Campbell Island shag breeding ecology is very poorly known. They breed from November to February in colonies of up to 150 nests in large sea caves, and on alcoves and cliff ledges, often beneath overhanging rocks. Elaborate courtship displays by males includes penguin-walking, holding the body horizontally, pressing the breast down and rump up, swinging the head backwards and forwards, gargling, bouncing, tail-raising, bill-gaping, and crest-lowering. Mated birds greet one another by waving their wide-open bills back and forth. Campbell Island shags are probably monogamous. The 2 pale blue eggs (64 x 39 mm) are laid in a large flattened bowl of twigs and tussock. The nestlings are naked with black skin on hatching, later growing dark brown down. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Campbell Island shags can forage in large flocks of 30 to 100 birds, with one very large flock of 2000 birds recorded in Perseverance Harbour. When hunting, birds fan out in a line on the sea surface, dipping their heads in the water and beating the surface with their wings. They simultaneously jump into the air before diving to feed on small shoaling fish and marine invertebrates. After swimming a long distance underwater, birds reappear scattered across the surface and swim back towards each other to regroup before another dive. Foraging flocks are sometimes accompanied by Cape petrels, Antarctic terns and red-billed gulls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The diet includes small shoaling fish and marine invertebrates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3688\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3688</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Harrison, P. 1987. <em>Seabirds of the world: a photographic guide</em>.

It is the only shag species found on Macquarie Island, where it lives all year round feeding in inshore waters. Macquarie Island is one of the few areas on the earth where upper mantle rocks are exposed at the surface, and is located approximately halfway between New Zealand and Antarctica at 54&#xB0;30&apos;S, 158&#xB0;57&apos;E. The island has a total area of 128 km2 and reaches an elevation of 410 m.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Macquarie Island shag is a medium-sized, black-and-white marine shag. Breeding adults have glossy black on the top and sides of the head and hindneck, with a black crest on the forehead. The boundary between the black cap and white face starts at the gape and extends back below the ear-coverts, giving the face a dark appearance. The upper wing coverts are dark brown with a green sheen. The tail is black. The throat, sides of the neck, and remaining underparts are white. The bill is grey with a prominent pair of orange caruncles above the base of the bill. The eye-ring is blue, the iris brown, and the facial skin is orange-brown, speckled with yellow. The feet are pink to purple-grey. The sexes are alike. Juveniles can be distinguished by their brown colouration rather than the blackish-brown of adults.</p>\n<p>Voice: resting males bark and tick, resting females hiss.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the nearest population of a related species is of the Campbell Island shag, which differs in having a dark throat, and&#xA0;lack of facial caruncles.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Macquarie Island shags are endemic to Macquarie Island&#xA0;and Bishop and Clerk islets, which lie 33 km to the south. They are sedentary, being poor fliers with small wings, and are restricted to inshore waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There has probably been a recent decline in this species on Macquarie Island with only 472 breeding pairs counted from 11 sites in October 2003 compared to 660 at 19 sites in the 1970s. A further 100 breeding pairs were recorded from Bishop Island and Clerk Island in the 1970s.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Feral cats have been eradicated from Macquarie Island, and it is likely that ship rats have been also, following aerial application of poison baits in July 2011. Both were likely predators of Macquarie Island shag eggs and chicks. Subantarctic skuas take some eggs and chicks, however, the harsh climate of the Southern Ocean is the biggest cause of mortality. Storms have been known to kill 90% of chicks and can also cause mortality amongst adults. Long periods of stormy conditions can also result in starvation because birds cannot forage.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Macquarie Island shags are colonial breeders building their nests 1-2 m apart on exposed rocky shores and stacks. The nest is a low, cone-shaped structure made of vegetation (grasses and algae) cemented with guano and mud. Males occupy a nesting site and display to attract females. A variety of elaborate postural displays, similar to those described for other pink-footed shags, are performed during pair-bonding and during changeover at nests. The 1-3 blue-green eggs are laid between September and January (peaking in the second half of October) with chicks hatching in December and fledging in late January to mid-February. Replacement clutches are laid if the first clutch fails. Fledgling success rates are difficult to estimate as juveniles move from the nest site before they become independent, but hatching rates of 60% (1.0-1.9 chicks per nest) have been recorded. Birds do not breed until they are 2-4 years old. Young birds usually remain together for only a single breeding season, although more experienced pairs remain together longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Macquarie Island shags are sedentary and are restricted to inshore waters. They may form large foraging flocks (up to 300 individuals) outside the breeding season. Birds roost in small or large flocks on bare ground during the autumn and winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet consists entirely of small benthic fish</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66995\">www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66995</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_shag\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_shag</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brothers, N.

Adult spotted shags in breeding plumage are elegant and colourful, sporting a Mohican-like double crest, bright green-blue facial skin and blue eye rings. The species gets its name from the small black spots that appear near the tip of each back and wing covert feather during the breeding season. Spotted shags are entirely marine, breeding on the coasts of the North, South and Stewart Islands, and feeding in waters out to 16 km. Outside the breeding season, spotted shags form large feeding and roosting flocks of up to 2000 birds. A recent DNA study proposes placing spotted shag and Pitt Island shag in the genus <em>Phalacrocorax </em>rather than<em> Stictocarbo</em>, closest to pied shag, black-faced shag (<em>P. fuscescens</em>) and little black shag.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The spotted shag is a slim, medium-sized, grey-blue marine shag with a long, slender bill and yellow-orange feet. Adult breeding birds have small black spots on the pale silver-grey and brown back and wings, pale grey-blue underparts, and black thighs, rump and tail. A distinctive curved broad white stripe runs from above the eye down both sides of the neck, separating the black lines of the throat, pale silver-grey and brown back, and long neck to the base of the wing. White filoplumes grow diagonally from the black neck and thighs, and a distinctive black, decurved, double crest grows erect on the forehead and nape. Bare facial skin between the eye and bill turns green-blue before the breeding season. The eye ring is blue, the iris dark brown. and the long, slender, hooked bill orange-brown. Non-breeding adults are duller, lack crests, have a neck stripe obscured by dark feathers, yellowish facial skin, and paler underparts. Immatures are paler and browner, and lack distinct head or neck markings. In flight, spotted shags appear slender and pale with a darker rump and tail. The usually fly low over water, often in &#x2018;V&#x2019; formation, using rapid wingbeats. Sexes are alike in plumage but males differ in their calls and courtship behaviour. The blue shag (<em>S.p. oliveri</em>) is darker with greenish-blue lower back, rump and flanks,&#xA0;with the white&#xA0;neck-stripe (in breeding plumage) not extending forward of the eye.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: loud grunts at resting, roosting and nesting areas. Silent elsewhere.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the spotted shag is the only slender, pale, greyish shag that occurs around the North, South and Stewart Islands. The closely-related Pitt Island shag takes the place of spotted shag at the Chattham Islands. Pitt Island shag is darker, lacks a neck stripe, and has a conspicuous purple patch in front of the eye. The ranges of Stewart Island shag and New Zealand king shag overlap with spotted shag, although they are darker and heavier with stockier necks, shorter wings and pink feet.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted shags occurs mainly around the South Island in coastal waters out to 16 km, entering inlets and estuaries to feed and roost. They are more localised on the west coast of the South Island, around Stewart Island, and parts of the North Island, including the Hauraki Gulf, West Auckland, Hawke&apos;s Bay and Wellington Harbour. The strongholds for spotted shags are the Marlborough Sounds, Banks Peninsula and Otago coast. They are concentrated around breeding sites during summer, dispersing to other coastal areas in winter to form large flocks, usually within 200 km of the breeding grounds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Estimated total population of 10,000 to 50,000 breeding pairs with increases recorded around Banks Peninsula and Wellington Harbour over recent decades. A census conducted on Banks Peninsula during the 1996 breeding season found 22,123 breeding pairs, more than double the 1960 census which found 9,787 pairs. There is speculation the population was formerly limited by food availability and that a reduction in fishing effort around Banks Peninsula, especially in the late 1980s, may have contributed to the observed growth in the spotted shag breeding population.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The IUCN Red List and Department of Conservation classify the spotted shag as Not Threatened. Nests around Ashburton were systematically destroyed after the number of fishing huts increased there in the 1970s. Colonies at the Noises Islands in the Hauraki Gulf were reduced by illegal shooting in the 1980s, resulting in a localised decline. Some birds are caught accidentally and drown in fishing nets. <a href=\"http://data.dragonfly.co.nz/psc/v20121101/other-birds/trawl/all-vessels/eez/all/\">See New Zealand fisheries by-catch information here.</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted shags breed in colonies of a few pairs to 700 pairs. Timing varies year to year and in different parts of the range, depending on food availability. Peaks of laying recorded in Hauraki Gulf during March, August and December, at Matiu/Somes Island during June and November, at Banks Peninsula and Otago Harbour during September-November, and at Punakaiki during March-April and August-October. Hundreds of colonies are present throughout range. Spotted shags are monogamous; 3-4 pale blue eggs are laid in large nest platform made of sticks, iceplant and grass built 1 m apart on coastal cliff ledges and stacks. Incubation and chick-rearing are shared. Young leave the nest at 62 days. The oldest spotted shag recorded was over 10 years old.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted shags dive from the sea surface to catch fish and marine invertebrates with their slender hooked bills, propelling themselves underwater with webbed feet. Outside the breeding season they form large feeding and roosting flocks of up to 2000 birds. Elaborate male display movements include wing-waving, swing-pointing, bowing, darting, sky-pointing, gaping, kink-throating, hopping, and various other body postures. Displaying males grunt; females are silent.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted shag diet consists of small fish and marine invertebrates, including squid and plankton. They feed in deep water up to 16 km offshore. Longest dive recorded was 70 seconds. Spotted shags often have a mass of small stones (&#x2018;rangle&#x2019;) in the their gizzards, the function of which is debated, with possibilities including to function as ballast, to grind up food, and to create an inhospitable environment for gut parasites. Roosting birds often regurgitate piles of rangle stones that are obvious on sandy beaches but overlooked at rocky sites.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_Shag\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_Shag</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3699\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3699</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Doherty, J.L.; Brager S. 1997.

As the only small slender grey shag with yellow feet in the islands, it is easily recognised. Despite its declining population, it can readily be found breeding and roosting in small groups along the rocky coast line throughout the group. It is a marine species that breeds and roosts on rocky headlands and offshore islets and within parts of the brackish Te Whanga Lagoon. A recent DNA study proposes placing spotted shag and Pitt Island shag in the genus <em>Phalacrocorax </em>rather than<em> Stictocarbo</em>, closest to pied shag, black-faced shag (<em>P. fuscescens</em>) and little black shag.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Pitt Island shag is a small, slender marine shag commonly seen roosting on rocky shorelines or feeding close offshore. It is the only yellow-footed shag in the Chatham Islands, and is slender and grey, with a very slender bill (all characters unlike the two other resident shag species: Chatham Island shag and black shag). Pitt Island shags have a dark brown-grey back with a small black spot on each feather, and a pale grey breast. The head is blackish when breeding and has a prominent double crest on the forehead and nape. In flight, Pitt Island shags appear slim and dark-bodied, and hold the head and neck horizontally. Before the breeding season, adults have dense white filoplumes on the hindneck and their facial skin is bright green. During breeding this fades to pale green, the filoplumes are shed, and the crests become less prominent. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: during breeding, male Pitt Island shags are noisy at colonies, with range of grunting, gargling and ticking calls, however females are silent. Birds are largely silent when away from colonies.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Pitt Island shags are unmistakeable in the Chatham Islands, being the only small slender grey shag with yellow feet. Birds in flight can be separated from other shag species present in the Chatham Islands by their slender profile and the way they hold their head and neck horizontally.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Pitt Island shag is endemic to the Chatham Islands group, with birds breeding on Chatham Island, Pitt Island (including offshore islets such as Rabbit Islands and Murumuru Rocks), Rangatira Island, Mangere Island, Little Mangere Island, Western Reef, The Castle, Star Keys, Sisters and Forty Fours. Colonies are situated on eroded pockets, cracks and ledges on coastal cliffs, with birds commonly roosting on headlands and offshore rock stacks. The Pitt Island shag is an exclusively marine feeder, foraging throughout inshore coastal waters. One small colony is found within the brackish Te Whanga Lagoon where birds also forage within the deeper, southern portion of the lagoon.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Pitt Island shag population has undergone significant decline in the past 15 years. In 1997 the breeding population was 729 pairs, but had declined to an estimated 434 pairs in 2011. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Populations of Pitt Island shag are threatened by loss of breeding habitat, disturbance from stock, human persecution, introduced predators, gull predation and fisheries bycatch. However given that population declines have been recorded at colonies on remote predator free off shore islands it is likely that some at-sea effects are impacting on the population.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There has been no direct conservation management action to benefit Pitt Island shag other than co-ordinated island wide population censuses. The recent increase in fencing coastal habitats on the Chatham Islands will prevent stock from gaining access to some colonies, thereby reducing disturbance. The conservation status of this species was changed from nationally endangered to nationally critical in 2013.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pitt Island shags breed in loose colonies of 5-40 pairs. Nests are built in eroded pockets, cracks and ledges on coastal cliffs. The 2-4 eggs are laid August &#x2013; September, sometimes as late as December. Adults share incubation, which takes around 30 days. Chicks are initially guarded by one parent, then are left alone in the nest when approximately two weeks old. Chicks are fed by regurgitation by both parents and probably fledge at about 6-8 weeks. It is likely that birds start breeding when 2-3 years old.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pitt Island shags roost in small flocks, but usually feed solitary. Birds feed close to shore along rocky coasts, and in the brackish Te Whanga Lagoon, where they swim on surface, diving to forage underwater for small fish. They are sedentary, remaining solely within coastal Chatham Island waters.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pitt Island shags catch and eat small fish, especially bullies, and marine invertebrates such as snails and polychaete worms.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3691\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3691</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Aikman, H.; Miskelly, C. 2004. <em>Birds of the Chatham Islands</em>.

Grey petrels have a circumpolar distribution, breeding on Antipodes, Campbell, Gough, Marion, Prince Edward Islands, Iles Crozet, and the Kerguelen and Tristan da Cunha groups. Grey petrels are winter breeders. In New Zealand, they breed in burrows on Antipodes and Campbell Islands; the largest colony is on Antipodes Island which holds an estimated 53,000 breeding pairs. Beach-wrecked juvenile grey petrels are often found on the east coast of the North Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Grey petrels are large, heavy bodied seabirds that are ashy grey above and white below, with slightly darker grey wings and tail. The legs and feet are fleshy grey, darker on the outside, with yellowish webs. The bill is stout, and green/yellow flesh, with black between the plates and on the nostrils.</p>\n<p>Voice: grey petrels rarely call at sea, but are very vocal on the ground during the breeding season, giving two main calls; a &#x2018;Moan&#x2019; - a low, barely audible calls when males and females are bonding in the burrow together or bonding with the chick, and &#x2018;Rattle&#x2019; &#x2013; loud quacking calls that are repeated often just after dark and before dawn and appear to be used to attract females to the burrow location. Both sexes also have a &#x2018;Bleat&#x2019; call when threatened (as an alarm call) or during territorial disputes.</p>\n<p>Similar species: very rare vagrant Cory&#x2019;s shearwater is larger and appears brownish-grey with a subtle darker M across the upper wings. Pink-footed shearwater (also a rare vagrant in New Zealand) is smaller with shorter wings, grey-brown upperparts and a pinkish bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Grey petrels breed on Antipodes Island and Campbell Island in the subantarctic. During the breeding season, grey petrels occur in waters east of New Zealand, particularly East Cape and the Gisborne coast. During the non-breeding season, grey petrels fly east to the Humboldt Current off Peru. Elsewhere, grey petrels breed on Macquarie, Gough, Marion and Prince Edward Islands, Iles Crozet, and the Kerguelen and Tristan da Cunha groups. They are most often seen at sea, ranging widely over deep water between 32&#xB0; and 58&#xB0;S. Grey petrels are rarely seen from land away from breeding islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The largest population of grey petrels in New Zealand is on Antipodes Island, with 53,000 breeding pairs. There are fewer than 100 pairs on Campbell Island. Other populations around the world range up to 25,000 pairs (Gough Island).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Since the eradication of Norway rats from Campbell Island, grey petrels have few land-based threats on their New Zealand breeding islands. Both Antipodes and Campbell Islands are legally protected island sanctuaries with restricted access. On other island colonies, grey petrels are affected by feral cats, rats and mice. Grey petrels have been caught by commercial fishers both in New Zealand waters and overseas and are recognised as at high risk from commercial fishing operations.</p>\n<p>Few conservation actions have specifically targeted grey petrels. The Antipodes Island population was surveyed in 2001 and foraging tracking (using geolocator devices) was undertaken between 2007 and 2008. Mitigation to reduce seabird bycatch has been put in place on commercial fisheries vessels operating within New Zealand. The conservation status of this species was moved from &apos;at risk - declining&apos; to &apos;at risk - naturally uncommon&apos; in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Grey petrels are colonial breeders, nesting in short to long (1-3 m) burrows on steep, well-draining slopes. They are monogamous, with shared incubation and chick care. Winter breeders, grey petrels attend the colony from February to December, with a single white egg laid in late March-April. Incubation is shared and takes 52-65 days. Chicks hatch from May-June and are left unattended during daylight when 1-3 days old. It is assumed that both parents feed the chick by regurgitation. Chicks fledge in October-December at 110-160 days old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey petrels are often solitary at sea, but sometimes form flocks around fishing vessels or in association with cetaceans. They typically feed on squid and fish by surface feeding or shallow diving. Grey petrels excavate their own burrows on steep, well-draining slopes of well-vegetated islands. They breed as monogamous pairs, which typically remain together throughout their breeding lives. Grey petrels primarily visit the breeding colonies after dark, but occasionally fly over the island and land in broad daylight. They depart before dawn, or stay in burrows during daylight. After breeding, grey petrels migrate to South America, staying in seas off Peru from December to March.</p>\n<p>Grey petrels are silent at sea, but are vocal on the breeding grounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Little is known about the main food items of grey petrels, but squid (Teuthoidea), fish and crustaceans have been recorded. Grey petrels readily take offal and discards from fishing vessels.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/petrelgrey.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/petrelgrey.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3925\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3925</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://acap.aq/en/resources/acap-species2/249-grey-petrel/file\">http://acap.aq/en/resources/acap-species2/249-grey-petrel/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bailey, A.M.; Sorensen, J.H. 1962.

Previously grouped with the gadfly petrels, genetic research shows they are more closely related to the shearwaters. The Tahiti petrel was first described from the mountainous interior of Tahiti in eastern Polynesia. It is highly pelagic outside the breeding season, ranging across tropical waters of the South Pacific Ocean, and occasionally reaching adjacent subtropical waters off Australia and New Zealand. Usually seen singly at sea, it sometimes forms loose feeding flocks or joins feeding flocks of other seabird species. They have also been recorded associating with surfacing pilot whales. Tahiti petrels feed predominantly on dead squid seized from the sea surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Tahiti petrel is a medium-sized dark-brown-and-white seabird that often appears black-and-white at sea. Its white breast and belly are sharply demarcated from its dark-brown hood, which extends from the head and neck to the upper breast. The mainly dark, long broad pointed wings span 84 cm. A thin white stripe runs along the centre of the mainly dark underwings. The bulbous black hooked bill has the tubular nostrils on top characteristic of all petrels, and the legs are flesh pink with blackish toes and webs. The sexes are similar, and juvenile birds resemble adults. The Tahiti petrel has a distinctive, straight-winged, languid flight that is more leisurely than most petrel species. It glides low over the water with long periods of arcing and banking, during which the wings are upturned with one pointing at the surface and one straight up. The gliding is interspersed with short bursts of shallow flapping. In stronger winds, the wings are held slightly more flexed, with arcing, banking and soaring movements becoming higher, resembling the flight of an albatross.</p>\n<p>Voice: calls include prolonged nasal shrieks and a long series of whistles, ending with a hooting sound.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the very similar looking Phoenix petrel has a pale throat and has white along the leading edge of the inner upperwing. Intermediate morph Kermadec petrels are distinguished from Tahiti petrel by their skua-like white wing flashes at the base of the primaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Tahiti petrels breed in the Marquesas, Society and Gambier islands (<a title=\"French Polynesia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Polynesia\" target=\"_blank\">French Polynesia</a>) and American Samoa in eastern Polynesia, and Fiji and New Caledonia (<a title=\"French special collectivity\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia\">special collectivity of France</a>) in south-east Melanesia. They formerly bred in Vanuatu and may breed on Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. Tahiti petrels occur at sea across the tropical South Pacific Ocean from the Coral Sea off Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Caledonia, and across Polynesia from Fiji and Samoa to Tahiti and the Gambier Islands in eastern Polynesia; birds occasionally reach New Zealand, with all 4 records during June-August 1988. Tahiti petrels disperse widely outside the breeding season and have been recorded north-east to Mexico and Peru, north-west to Taiwan, and south-west to the Mozambique Channel. They spend most of their lives far out at sea, rarely approaching land except to breed.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>One specimen, beach-wrecked at Glinks Gully, Dargaville (June 1988); sight records from near &#xA0;White Island (July 1988), the Alderman Islands (August 1998), and east of the Poor Knights Islands (August 1998).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of Tahiti petrels has been estimated at c. 10,000 pairs plus up to 30,000 unpaired birds. Breeding occurs at a relatively large number of islands but it has a moderately small global population that is declining.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The IUCN Red List classifies the Tahiti petrel as Near Threatened because it is declining due to predation by introduced mammals, such as cats, dogs, pigs and rats at multiple islands, and localised mining activity in New Caledonia. On some islands birds are disoriented, injured or killed by collisions with power lines in urban areas after being attracted to artificial lights. This has mainly been recorded around Papeete in Tahiti,&#xA0;rural villages&#xA0;around Noumea, and active mining sites in New Caledonia. In French Polynesia, some birds are taken to use their white feathers as fishing lures.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Tahiti petrels breed in the Marquesas, Society and Gambier Islands of French Polynesia, and in American Samoa, Fiji and New Caledonia. They nest mainly in burrows on mountain ridges and hills, or in rock crevices with forest cover, up to 12 km inland. Nests are located between 150 and 2000 m above sea level on Tahiti. In New Caledonia, birds breed in the mountainous interior of Grande Terre and on the ground on coral and rocky islets in the southern lagoon. Breeding birds studied in the southern lagoon incubated a single egg for 54-56 days and the chick fledged 110-120 days after hatching. The relatively restricted breeding period there occurs October&#x2013;December. On Tahiti there appears to be a peak egg-laying period between March and July. Dated museum specimens from the Marquesas Islands indicate laying has occurred there in July, August and October.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Tahiti petrels glide efficiently on long pointed wings, and are able to cover large areas in search of prey. They spend most of their lives far out at sea, rarely approaching land except to breed. Tahiti petrels nest singly or in loose colonies, where they are strictly nocturnal.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Tahiti petrels are thought to seize prey from the sea surface, where they specialise in foraging for dead squid.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3880\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3880</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bretagnolle, V.; Atti&#xE9;, C.; Pasquet, E. 1998.

In the non-breeding season they migrate to the South Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina and off South Africa in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. They do not often stray further, but one was presumably caught up in the prevailing westerly winds and swept into the Tasman Sea where it died and was washed ashore on the Manawatu coast in January 1934.

Buller&#x2019;s shearwater is strongly patterned in two tones of brown and grey above, and has a dark bill. Grey petrel has dark underwings and a greenish bill. Streaked shearwater is similar to Cory&#x2019;s shearwater but has a pale head, streaked white and dark. Pale morph wedge-tailed shearwater is slimmer and longer-tailed, with a much finer, dark bill. Great shearwater has a pronounced cap, contrasting with a pale nape, and has patches of dark feathers on the belly and under-wing, and a dark bill. Pink-footed shearwater is the most similar to Cory&#x2019;s shearwater, but has dark undertail coverts and usually has some or extensive dusky markings on the flanks and underwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Cory&#x2019;s shearwaters breed on islands off Portugal, the Azores, Madeira and Canary Island groups. From November to May, non-breeding birds are found in the South Atlantic Ocean offshore from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina and in the vicinity of southern Africa including the Indian Ocean occasionally as far as Amsterdam and St Paul Islands.

They are widely distributed throughout the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans, where they breed on tropical or subtropical islands, including the Kermadec Islands. Wedge-tailed shearwaters rarely reach waters off the New Zealand mainland, with most seen at sea off the north-east coast, and a few beach-wrecked on North Island coasts. Pale-bellied birds are rare in the South Pacific and western Indian Oceans, but comprise 20-30% of the Western Australian population, and almost 100% of the Hawaiian population.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p>The wedge-tailed shearwater population in the south-west Pacific is comprised of all-dark birds. They have a small head, slender body, and long tail. Their plumage is blackish-brown, with the feathers of the back and wings edged in slightly lighter brown. The chin, throat and forehead are brownish-grey, with the underparts dusky brown. Pale-bellied birds (mainly North Pacific) have a dark greyish-brown head, nape and upperparts, grading into the white chin and throat. Their underparts are mainly white with variable grey-brown mottling on the sides of the breast, flanks and undertail. The underwings are white with a broad dark trailing edge. The slender bill is dark slate grey, and the legs are pale flesh-coloured. The sexes are alike with no seasonal variation. In flight, wedge-tailed shearwaters alternate fast wing-beats with long glides.</p>\n<p>Voice: on breeding grounds, wedge-tailed shearwaters make a wailing moan <em>&apos;ka-whooo-ahh&apos;</em>. Colonies produce a cacophony of calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the more southern-ranging flesh-footed shearwater is larger, bulkier and shorter-tailed, with a pale pink dark-tipped bill. Short-tailed shearwater is shorter (42 cm) but heavier (550 g), with a shorter bill, shorter tail, and greyish feet. Christmas Island shearwater is smaller and shorter-tailed, with dark legs and feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The wedge-tailed shearwater is a widely distributed migratory species throughout the Pacific and Indian oceans. It breeds on many islands including Kermadec (New Zealand), Norfolk, Lord Howe, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Pitcairn, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Solomon, Johnston Atoll, Christmas (Kiribati), Marshall, Caroline, Bonin, the Hawaiian archipelago, Madagascar, the Seychelles, and Reunion and islands off the west and east coasts of Australia and the west coast of Mexico.</p>\n<p>Wedge-tailed shearwaters are pelagic in the tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian oceans, mainly between 35&#xB0;N and 35&#xB0;S. Southern hemisphere birds migrate north of the Equator, with the Kermadec population migrating to the south-east North Pacific during the austral winter. Wedge-tailed shearwaters rarely reach waters off the New Zealand mainland, with a few recorded at sea between Cape Reinga and East Cape, or beach-wrecked birds on North Island coasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The wedge-tailed shearwater has an estimated global population of 5 million+ birds, including an estimated 50,000+ pairs that breed at the Kermadec Islands (Raoul, Meyer and Herald Islets, Macauley, Curtis, Cheeseman and L&apos;Esperance Rock).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Although it has a large estimated global population, the wedge-tailed shearwater may be declining in some areas due to changes in its food supply possibly linked to declining tuna stocks and changes in sea temperature. In 2002, unusually high sea-surface temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef were accompanied by reduced provisioning, decreased growth rates and reproductive failure of wedge-tailed shearwaters in the region. Over-exploitation through poaching or persecution is also likely to reduce some populations. Wedge-tailed shearwaters are vulnerable to predation by invasive species, including feral cats, rats and pigs, which kill and eat birds and eggs.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the Kermadec Islands population breeds on Macauley Island where introduced Pacific rats were eradicated in 2006, and also on smaller islands (e.g. Curtis Island and the Herald Islets) that never had introduced predators. In contrast, the breeding population on Raoul Island (by far the largest island in the group) is a fraction of the immense numbers present there 100 years ago. The almost complete extirpation of wedge-tailed shearwaters on Raoul Island was due to predation by introduced cats and rats. Wedge-tailed shearwaters were rare on Raoul Island by 1966-1967, and no evidence for their presence was found in 1993-1994 (though a single bird was found in a burrow there in April 1998). Feral goats were eradicated from Raoul Island in 1984, followed by feral cats and rats in 2002. In 2008, 13 active wedge-tailed shearwater burrows were found on Raoul Island, signalling the start of a return to their former stronghold.</p>\n<p>The IUCN Red List classifies wedge-tailed shearwater as Least Concern. The Department of Conservation classifies it as Relict (B; range restricted, and secure overseas), meaning that it remains numerous but now occupies less than 10% of its original range, reflecting the human-induced extirpation of the formerly enormous Raoul Island population.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Wedge-tailed shearwaters breed from October to May at the Kermadec Islands, and are absent June-September. Breeding birds arrive from October with mating taking place during October-November. They are monogamous, and lay their single large (67 x 43 mm) white egg in December. Nests are usually in a burrow up to 2.5 m long, but may be on the ground under an overhanging rock, in a small cave, or under vegetation. Incubation takes 50-54 days and is shared by both adults. Eggs hatch in early February. The chicks grow much larger than adults during the nestling period, increasing to c.560 g before slimming down to c.430 g at fledging. Adults typically depart on migration 1-2 weeks before the chicks fledge around mid-May, at about 90 days-old. Wedge-tailed shearwaters start breeding at about 4 years-old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The wedge-tailed shearwater is an annual breeder in dense colonies. They are usually solitary at sea, but sometimes form small feeding flocks or rafts at sea off colonies. Both adults dig the burrow using their bill and feet. After mating, both birds return to sea to feed for several weeks before egg-laying and incubation.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Wedge-tailed shearwaters feed mainly on fish, including flying fish, plus squid, insects, jellyfish and prawns. They often form feeding flocks over tuna or dolphins, which drive smaller fish to the surface, where wedge-tailed shearwaters may form feeding aggregations with sooty and white terns, noddies and boobies. They are also attracted to fishing vessels. Wedge-tailed shearwaters forage by contact-dipping, surface-seizing and sometimes deep plunging, exceptionally diving up to 66 m below the surface (less than 14 m is typical).</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge-tailed_Shearwater\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge-tailed_Shearwater</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3928\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3928</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J.

They breed only at the Poor Knights Islands near Whangarei, northern New Zealand. Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters are common around much of New Zealand, especially in the Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Plenty. They feed mainly on small fish and krill, and regularly associate with large shoals of fish near the surface. The shearwaters dominate their sole breeding islands, excluding most other large species of petrels. After breeding, they migrate to the North Pacific Ocean where they congregate along oceanic currents east of Japan. Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters are also regular visitors to the North American coast in the boreal autumn.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters is a medium-large shearwater, brown-grey above and white below, with long broad wings and a long pointed tail in flight. They have a dark-brown cap extending to just below the eyes, contrasting sharply with their white cheeks. The upper body surface is brown-grey with darker brown-black feathers running across the upper wings in an M-shape, and brown-grey on the rump contrasting with the much darker tail. The entire underside including the underwings is white. In the hand, the bill (38-45 mm long) is grey-black with a sharp hook to seize prey. The legs and feet are dark brown-mauve on the outside and pink on the inside.</p>\n<p>Voice: the calls of Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters resemble those of sooty shearwaters with wailing, cooing and groaning sounds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: several other large brown-above-and-white-below shearwaters occur rarely in New Zealand waters; none have the strongly patterned two-tone upper-surface of the Buller&#x2019;s shearwater. Pale morph wedge-tailed shearwaters are more uniformly dark above and duskier on the underwing. Great shearwater has a pale nape contrasting strongly with a blackish cap, a pale crescent on the rump, and a variable dark belly patch. Pink-footed shearwater has a pink bill with a dark tip, and is darker underneath than the very white Buller&#x2019;s shearwater.</p>\n<p>From Cook Strait north and especially in the Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Plenty, Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters occur alongside the smaller fluttering shearwater, which is uniformly dark brown above, duskier below (especially on the underwings), and flaps more than Buller&#x2019;s shearwater.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The sole breeding grounds for Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters are the Poor Knights Islands off Tutukaka, northern New Zealand. (There is a single record of a nest being found on Simmonds Islands, Henderson Bay, Far North.) Within the Poor Knights Islands, Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters are extremely abundant on both main islands. The colonies on Aorangi are scattered whereas those on Tawhiti Rahi are much denser. The breeding burrows are normally dug on well-drained slopes in dry spongy soils or in clay soils amongst rocks. The nests are under tall pohutukawa forest or amongst <em>Astelia</em> or <em>Xeronema</em> patches on ridgetops. Some burrows are under low coastal shrubs such as ngaio. Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters forage over warm water north of 45&#xB0;S, either over shallow inshore seas or over deep water beyond the continental shelf. After the breeding season, they migrate to the central South Pacific before heading north to complete the annual feather moult in the North Pacific Ocean east of Japan.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are no recent robust estimates of population size from the breeding islands. The population was thought to be 2.5 million birds in the 1980s. Recent rapid surveys on Aorangi Island suggest there may be fewer than 100,000 pairs using this island, less than half of the estimate made in 1981.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>There are currently no land-based threats to Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters. The breeding islands previously had feral pigs on Aorangi Island but these were eradicated in 1936. New introductions of mammalian predators are a potential risk, as are fires on these dry northern islands. At sea, oil spills are a major threat with the colony lying close to the shipping lane for the main oil terminal in New Zealand. The&#xA0;2011 Rena oil spill resulted in the deaths of at least 156 Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters that became coated in oil. Some Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters are caught as by-catch during fishing operations. Harvesting of shoaling fish is also a threat to the shearwaters, as they regularly feed over fish shoals. The large fish drive small prey to the surface, which allows the shearwaters to access small fish and krill.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters breed from September to May with the single large (65 x 43 mm) white egg laid from late November to mid- December and hatching in January. The egg is laid in a lightly lined nest at the back of burrows that are 0.6-3.2 m long. Buller&#x2019;s shearwaters are considered to be sensitive to human disturbance and as a result the breeding biology is still poorly known. Incubation takes about 51 days, and the chicks fledge in May, when about 100 days old.

They nest on offshore islands around northern New Zealand and in Cook Strait. Flesh-footed shearwaters are attracted to boats and are commonly observed over inshore seas, especially in the Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Plenty. They often sit behind recreational fishing boats and dive to retrieve bait and discarded fish scraps. Their persistence in taking bait from fishing lines puts them into conflict with both recreational and commercial fishers, often with fatal consequences. After breeding, the birds migrate to the North Pacific Ocean where they spend the northern summer in the seas off eastern Japan. The return migration is through the central Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The flesh-footed shearwater is a medium to large-sized dark brown shearwater (tube-nosed seabird) with long relatively broad wings and a long pointed tail in flight. They are uniformly dark plumaged, contrasting with the pink-white bill and white-flesh coloured legs. In the hand, the pale bill (38-45 mm long) has a sharp hook.</p>\n<p>Voice: the calls of flesh-footed shearwaters resemble cats fighting, with loud wailing and moaning.</p>\n<p>Similar species: dark morph wedge-tailed shearwaters are very similar but have longer tails and all-dark bills. Black petrel (which co-occurs with flesh-footed shearwater in the outer Hauraki Gulf and adjacent deeper water) is larger and heavier-looking, with darker black plumage, a&#xA0;creamy-white (cf. pinkish) bill and black legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Flesh-footed shearwaters nest on 15 islands around northern New Zealand and in Cook Strait, with the largest colonies on the Chickens and Mercury groups plus Ohinau and Karewa Islands. Elsewhere, there are colonies on Lord Howe Island, islands off Western Australia and on Ile St Paul in Indian Ocean. The breeding burrows are normally dug on well drained sites with sandy or clay soils, and under tall forest or low coastal shrubs such as taupata or kanuka. The birds are powerful diggers and dig burrows 1-4 m in length. Flesh-footed shearwaters forage over warmer water north of 43&#xB0;S, either over shallow inshore seas or over deep water beyond the continental shelf. After the breeding season, they migrate north past Fiji and Tonga to complete the annual feather moult in the North Pacific Ocean off Japan.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Recent surveys in New Zealand have found far fewer flesh-footed shearwater pairs than expected. A survey of 8 major colonies found 8000 pairs, and a further 3000 pairs are estimated to occur on Middle Island. The total New Zealand population is therefore less than 12,000 pairs. Declines have also taken place on Lord Howe Island, and so the species is now considered threatened.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Flesh-footed shearwaters are largely free of land-based threats in New Zealand. All of the breeding sites except one are now cleared of introduced predators or have active pest control happening. However, at sea, the situation is not as rosy. Flesh-footed shearwaters are regularly caught as bycatch in several commercial fisheries. They are also frequently caught by recreational fishers; although most such birds are released with no or minor injuries, there is disturbing evidence that many flesh-footed shearwaters are severely injured or killed by fishers hitting them to keep them away from fishing baits. Flesh-footed shearwaters were vulnerable in the 2011 Rena oil spill and are at risk in future oil spills. The Lord Howe Island shearwater population has encountered problems with plastics being ingested by the birds and this same threat may also exist in the New Zealand populations. Flesh-footed shearwaters also feed close inshore in eastern Japan and some birds may have been exposed to land-based pollutants and raised levels of radioactivity in the ocean after the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear reactor plant explosions. The conservation status of this species was changed from declining to nationally vulnerable in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Flesh-footed shearwaters breed from September to May with the single large (69 x 46 mm) white egg laid from early to mid-December and hatching in late January or early February. Chicks depart in May. The egg is laid in a lightly-lined nest at the back of burrows (1-4 m long). Flesh-footed shearwaters can be sensitive to human disturbance and sometimes temporarily desert nests by day after handling, although the birds normally return to the nest within a day or two. Egg-chilling resistance in this species (a trait common to other petrels and shearwaters) allows the egg to continue developing with little impact on breeding success. Flesh-footed shearwater breeding success is affected by oceanic conditions, with good years dependent on ocean currents bringing lots of small fish to seas near the colonies. Immature flesh-footed shearwaters start to return to colonies as 4 year-olds and first start breeding at 5-6 years of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Flesh-footed shearwaters are nocturnally active at breeding grounds. The first birds start flying over the islands soon after sunset and birds can come ashore throughout the night. Prospecting birds are very noisy on the surface at night, calling from burrow entrances and in flight over the colony. The birds are especially noisy in the period just before dawn and on large colonies it is nearly impossible for people to sleep through the dawn exodus period. The calls resemble those of cats having a huge fight. At sea, the birds range widely away from the breeding colonies, foraging over the continental shelf. They mainly forage around the North Island, but also regularly north and west towards Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands. They are often seen from ships and boats, and will follow boats hoping for fish scraps or offal to be discharged. Flesh-footed shearwaters are trans-equatorial migrants, flying north directly after breeding via the top of the Tasman Sea or past Fiji and Tonga before heading north-west at the equator to reach the seas off Japan. They return by heading into the central North Pacific and then south past Hawaii and down into the north Tasman Sea or past Tonga and the Kermadec Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Flesh-footed shearwaters specialise on small fish caught by shallow dives into shoals, or occasional deeper dives reaching 30 m in depth. They sometimes eat small squid. Chicks are fed 80-90 g meals every 2-3 days on average. Activity sensors applied to the shearwaters legs suggest most&#xA0;feeding occurs during the hours of daylight.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh-footed_Shearwater\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh-footed_Shearwater</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3930\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3930</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Baker, G.B.; Wise, B.S. 2005.

They may occur in spectacular flocks of tens of thousands, particularly around the southern South Island and Stewart Island, when they congregate on bait balls of crustaceans and feed by flying into the water from a shallow angle. Also known as muttonbirds, the young are harvested at traditional sites around Stewart Island by descendants of Rakiura Maori. &apos;Muttonbirders&apos; can access the islands from 15 March to prepare for the harvest, which starts on 1 April and can continue until 31 May. During the first half of the season, chicks are extracted from their burrows during the daytime. Once the chicks start emerging at night in preparation for their departure (mainly in May), they are captured in large numbers on the surface, with the daily take limited by the time it takes to pluck and process the birds the following day. The total harvest from the Stewart Island region is estimated to be around 400,000 chicks per annum.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The sooty shearwater is a large, dark shearwater with long, narrow wings, long slender bill and narrow short tail. The upperparts are sooty brown whilst the underparts are slightly greyer with a silver-grey flash on the outer area of the underwings. The feet are dark grey, and barely project beyond the tail in flight.</p>\n<p>Voice: sooty shearwaters are usually silent at sea; most calls are given by birds at night on the breeding colonies, though occasional calls are given by birds flying over breeding colonies at night. The main call is a loud, rhythmically repeated slightly hysterical <em>coo-roo-ah</em> which is generally given by duetting birds from within burrows or on the surface. Softer crooning may be given by birds in their burrows during the day, especially if they detect movements from the surface above.</p>\n<p>Similar species: sooty shearwaters may be confused with several other species of shearwaters and petrels. The most similar is the short-tailed shearwater which is similarly-coloured but slightly smaller, with a relatively smaller head and bill. It typically has dull grey underwings, darker than sooty shearwater, and the feet usually extend beyond the tail when the bird is in flight. The wedge-tailed shearwater is slightly smaller, has a long slender wedge-shaped tail, and has dark plumage overall with no pale plumage under the wings. The flesh-footed shearwater is also slightly smaller by weight, and dark overall, but has a paler bill and noticeably pale legs and feet that do not extend beyond the tip of the tail when in flight. The grey-faced petrel has a different shape (larger headed, shorter necked, longer wings) and has a chunky black bill and a variable pale face, contrasting with remaining dark grey plumage.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The sooty shearwater is one of the most widely distributed seabirds in the world. In addition to breeding in New Zealand, it also breeds on islands off Australia, Chile and the Falklands. During the breeding season (September-May) it occurs throughout coastal New Zealand waters, making trips of about 2000 km each way to forage in the vicinity of the Polar Front at about 65&#xB0;S, especially when gathering food for its young. After breeding, birds from New Zealand migrate to the North Pacific Ocean where each bird stops over in one of three discrete regions off Japan, Alaska or California before returning to New Zealand for the following breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty shearwaters breed on numerous islands around New Zealand, from the Three Kings in the north and south to islands around Stewart Island, as well as The Snares, Auckland, Campbell, Antipodes and Chatham Islands. A few small colonies persist on headlands of mainland South Island. All the large colonies are around Stewart Island or on The Snares. There are no accurate estimates of the total New Zealand population, but based on recent detailed work on the large populations on The Snares and islands off Stewart Island it was estimated that the population was about 21 million birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Introduced mammals, particularly feral cats, rats, mustelids, feral pigs and dogs have extirpated most mainland sooty shearwater breeding colonies. Large breeding populations are now restricted to predator-free offshore islands. The sooty shearwater is one of the seabird species most frequently observed killed in the New Zealand fisheries during 1996-2004, with demersal longliners and trawling operations responsible for the majority of mortalities. Sooty shearwaters migrate to the North Pacific Ocean, where they may be at greater risk from pollutants and gill net fisheries.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty shearwaters breed in large, dense colonies. They are monogamous with shared incubation and chick care. The nest is lined with leaf litter and is in a chamber at the end of a burrow. However, the burrow system is complex and varies with locality so that several pairs may share a common entrance or there may be several entrances to one burrow system. Birds tend to return to the same area from year to year, but may not use the same burrow in successive years. A single large (77 x 4 mm) &#xA0;white egg is laid from late November to mid-December. Incubation takes 53-56 days; chicks fledge at about 86-106 days and are independent at fledging (late April to early June).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>At sea, sooty shearwaters may occur in large flocks to feed on concentrations of crustaceans or small fish. They often dive to obtain food, using their half-opened wings and webbed feet for propulsion. In areas of dense concentrations of prey they may form extensive rafts on the sea after they have fed.</p>\n<p>During the breeding season they congregate offshore from their breeding colonies during the early evening and generally start coming ashore after sunset and throughout the early part of the night. When landing they tend to crash through the vegetation and land near their burrow. During the early part of the breeding season colonies are very busy and noisy with birds cleaning out burrows and others courting. Their departure from the colonies begins about two hours before dawn and is equally noisy, with unemployed birds emerging from burrows and moving through the colony to some well-defined cliff top or well-placed tree from which they can launch off and return to the sea. Sooty shearwaters are annual breeders that usually return to the area year after year, often with the same partner. After breeding the colonies are deserted and the birds migrate to the North Pacific Ocean. Banding shows that about 92% of breeders survive from one year to the next, and so oldest birds would live for over 20 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty shearwater eat fish, squid, krill, and offal from fishing vessels taken from the surface and by diving. Birds frequently plunge or dive for food to depths averaging 16 m, and have been recorded swimming to depths of over 60 m.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_Shearwater\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_Shearwater</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3933\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3933</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/08-14/shearwaters.asp\">http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/08-14/shearwaters.asp</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/map/5484/new-zealand-sooty-shearwater-migration\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/map/5484/new-zealand-sooty-shearwater-migration</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Although rarely seen in New Zealand seas, they are often cast ashore on New Zealand west coast beaches in winter and spring. Kerguelen petrels fly impetuously, towering high above the sea before swooping down to wave level again. It is the only member of the genus <em>Lugensa</em>, and was for many years placed with other gadfly petrels in the genus <em>Pterodroma</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Kerguelen petrel is a medium-small, uniformly dark seabird that otherwise resembles a small grey-faced petrel. It is sooty-grey all over, with black bill, and pink-and-black legs and feet. The underwing is uniformly dark, but can reflect low sunlight to appear silvery at the base of the main flight feathers. It appears large-headed and short-necked, with a steep forehead. The bill appears deep and robust in side profile, with prominent nasal tubes and terminal hook. From above, the bill is surprisingly narrow.</p>\n<p>Kerguelen petrels are usually solitary at sea, and fly with a distinctive towering flight, using all the air space from wave troughs to 30 metres high. They show little interest in ships, but may fly high over the bow as they pass.</p>\n<p>Voice: Kerguelen petrels are silent at sea, and quiet at breeding colonies, where they give a wheezy <em>chee-chee-chay</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: grey-faced petrel has a similar silhouette, but is larger, longer winged, and the grey face is usually prominent. At close range, the bill of the grey-faced petrel is much larger and more robust.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Kerguelen petrel is a pelagic seabird of the southern oceans, though less abundant in the Pacific sector. It ranges from the pack ice north to about &#xA0;33&#xB0; S. They mainly stay near breeding islands during the southern summer, but immature birds often strand on New Zealand beaches in winter and spring, overlapping with the October laying period. Kerguelen petrels breed on Gough and Inaccessible Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean, and Marion, Prince Edward, Crozet and Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean. They nest in colonies, burrowing into flat or gently-sloping tundra or tussock-covered slopes with saturated soils.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The global population of Kerguelen petrels is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 pairs. Major colonies include Gough, Prince Edward, Marion, Crozet and Kerguelen Islands. They are mainly recorded as beach-wrecked specimens in New Zealand, especially during July-November. Numbers are highly variable each year, with a median of 29 birds, and a range from 1 bird in 1979 to 600 in 1984, when there was a similarly large wreck of blue petrels. Other large wrecks occurred in 1981 (284 birds), 1994 (262) and 1999 (331 birds). Over 200 birds were seen flying near the Open Bay Islands, South Westland, during 8-9 August 1985, yet only 122 were found dead on New Zealand beaches that year.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Kerguelen petrels are not globally threatened, but introduced cats and rats are likely to have had severe impacts at some colonies. Feral cats are present on Kerguelen Island and Isle aux Cochons, Crozet Islands, and were present on Marion Island until their eradication in 1991. Ship rats remain present on Isle de la Possession, Crozet Islands The subantarctic skua is the Kerguelen petrel&#x2019;s main natural predator.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The Kerguelen petrel is a colonial, monogamous burrow-nester. Both sexes incubate the single white egg (57 x 45 mm) for 46-51 days, and feed the chick by regurgitation. The chick fledges after 59-62 days. Laying occurs in October, hatching in December, and fledging in late January or early February.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The Kerguelen petrel is a pelagic seabird, only coming ashore to breed. They are usually solitary at sea, but will indulge in exuberant chases when multiple birds are present. As typical for most small petrels, Kerguelen petrels are nocturnal at their breeding sites, nest in burrows in large colonies, are monogamous, and have shared care of the single egg and chick. Kerguelen show little interest in ships.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Kerguelen petrels mainly eat squid, also crustaceans and small fish, obtained on or near the sea surface by dipping or surface-seizing.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3877\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3877</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

At sea, it is fast and graceful with a high soaring powerful flight on long narrow wings. Grey-faced petrels breed around northern New Zealand, on islands as well as a few mainland headlands. The birds begin breeding in the middle of winter, but many chicks don&#x2019;t fledge until the height of summer. The grey-faced petrel is sometimes referred to as the northern muttonbird, and some iwi still exercise their rights to harvest the petrel chicks between mid-November and mid-December each year. Grey-faced petrels are making a comeback as many breeding islands have been cleared of pests.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The grey-faced petrel is a large dark gadfly petrel with long narrow wings and a long pointed tail. The entire body is uniformly dark black-brown but with occasional paler brown worn feathers. The base of the bill and throat are either grey or buff-white. In the hand, the stout black bill (33-40 mm long) has a large sharp hook that can slice through squid and the hands of those holding these birds. The eyes and legs are black.</p>\n<p>Voice: the main flight calls are high pitched whistles <em>whis-her</em>, <em>wik-wik</em> or low moans <em>oor-wik</em>. These same calls are given frequently on the surface or from burrows.</p>\n<p>Similar species: other all-dark gadfly petrels are rare in New Zealand coastal water. Providence petrel is greyer and has white flashes on the underwing. Dark morph Kermadec petrel is smaller with a shorter tail and white shafts on the primaries. Kerguelen petrel (most likely to occur August-October) is smaller with a shorter bill and glossy grey sheen on its plumage and silver-white leading edge on the underwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-faced petrels are one of the few burrowing petrels to still survive on the New Zealand mainland. Small colonies are scattered around the coasts of the upper North Island, mainly on headlands and peninsulas adjacent to the sea. Over 100 colonies are still present but most sites have fewer than 500 breeding pairs. The largest colonies occur on the Three Kings, Hen and Chickens, Mokohinau, Mercury and Alderman Island groups, and also on Cuvier, Moutohora, White and East Islands. Nests are mainly in burrows under tall forest, but also under grass or shrublands, especially near cliffs above the sea. Sandy or friable soils with few rocks and tree roots are preferred.</p>\n<p>During the breeding season, grey-faced petrels feed mainly in the Tasman Sea or east of New Zealand, around the continental shelf edge or over deeper oceanic water, ranging thousands of kilometres. During the summer moult period, they disperse widely across the Tasman Sea to the coast of Australia, and some reach the Coral Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The largest colonies are on Moutohora Island and Hongiora Island in the Bay of Plenty. Over 100,000 pairs breed on these two islands combined. Elsewhere there are many smaller colonies with mostly less than 500 pairs but some of the larger islands have 1000-20,000 pairs. The world population is estimated to be 200,000 to 300,000 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The major threat to grey-faced petrels is mammalian predators on their breeding grounds, especially feral cats and&#xA0;rats. Many former colonies have been lost due to predators, and some mainland colonies are sustained by immigration from island colonies. Eradication of rats from islands has benefitted grey-faced petrels at many sites, as rats take eggs and chicks. A small colony at Rapanui in Taranaki has been protected by the building of a predator-exclusion fence. Long-term studies of grey-faced petrels at several sites have improved our understanding of the ecology of this species. The information obtained supported the conservation of the related and critically endangered Chatham Island taiko. These studies included captive-rearing trials, testing of tracking devices, long-term marking projects and research on the breeding biology and diet. Translocations of chicks to establish new colony sites have been attempted but are still in the early stages of chick returns. Grey-faced petrels occasionally follow fishing boats and sometimes occur as by-catch on long-line fisheries.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The breeding biology of the grey-faced petrel is well known from several long-term studies. The season is broadly March to January with the single white egg (68 x 48 mm) laid between mid-June and late July. The well-lined nest chamber is at the end of a long burrow dug into soil, or amongst vegetation. The egg hatches in August or September after c.55 days of incubation, and the chick fledges between November and January at c.118 days-old. Grey-faced petrel mostly breed annually; very few pairs skip a breeding season. Incubation and chick-care are shared. The chick is independent of the parents at fledging. Immatures begin to return to colonies at 3 years of age and can breed as early as four years of age but most delay breeding until they are 8-10 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-faced petrels are nocturnally active at the breeding grounds. Unlike their relatives on southern islands, grey-faced petrels are very active on the colony surface at night, with birds calling, prospecting for burrows, displaying and sleeping ashore. Activity ashore is more pronounced on dark nights during periods of wet weather, but birds will return in bright moonlight on windy nights. Spectacular aerial courtship chases over the colony are a feature of this species and the breeding sites can be quite noisy during April/May and again in August. At sea, grey-faced petrels fly rapidly out to the continental shelf edge before they begin foraging for food. They can cover large distances in their quest for food with birds recorded flying to the east coast of Australia while their partner is sitting on the egg. After breeding the birds disperse mainly to warmer water in the North Tasman Sea or off southern and eastern Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-faced petrels are generalists feeding most often on squid but they also eat crustaceans and fish. They have been observed capturing prey at night but activity recorders also show they frequently alight at sea during the day and presumably take prey. Smaller squid are captured alive on the surface, but larger squid are probably scavenged when dead animals float to the surface. Studies of the diving ability of the species reveals they mainly feed in the top 5m of the water column but are capable of occasional deeper dives, perhaps down to 20 m.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/oi.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/oi.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. 2004. <em>Albatrosses and petrels across the world</em>.

It is the largest (by weight) of the 34 species of <em>Pterodroma </em>petrels, a group of seabirds also known as gadfly petrels because of their high soaring flight at sea. White-headed petrels are similar in size to a large gull but have the long narrow wings typical of their family. These allow the birds to fly swiftly to distant feeding grounds, perhaps hundreds or thousands of kilometres from land, where they feed mainly on krill and squid. The white-headed petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding grounds, probably a response to the presence of predatory subantarctic skuas that hunt seabirds on these southern islands. The general biology of white-headed petrels is still quite poorly known.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The white-headed petrel is a large grey-and-white petrel (tube-nosed seabird) with a pale white head, prominent dark eye patch, long narrow wings and long pointed tail. The upper surface is pale grey contrasting with darker grey on the upperwings and rump. The underside is mostly white but with contrasting dark-grey underwings. From a distance these birds can appear all white with dark grey underwings. In the hand, the stout black bill (38mm long, 18 mm deep) has a large sharp hook to seize prey. The tubed nostrils (to excrete excess salt) are prominent. The legs are pink/white with black patches on the toes.</p>\n<p>Voice: the calls of white-headed petrels are similar to those of the closely related grey-faced petrel. The calls are mainly higher pitched shrill whistles <em>ti-ti-ti </em>or <em>wik-wik-wik</em> and lower pitched moans <em>ooo-er&#xA0; and or-wik</em> sounds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: soft-plumaged petrels are similar in shape and plumage-markings, but are smaller and appear hooded, with dusky &#x2013;grey on the head and upper breast. Grey petrel is larger and also has dark underwings, but is darker on the head, has a pale green bill, and is a different shape, with longer neck and smaller head. Pale morph Kermadec petrels are smaller, do not have a dark eye patch, are darker on the back and tail, and have prominent white flashes on the outer underwing, and corresponding pale primary shafts showing above.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The white-headed petrel breeds in colonies on subantarctic Kerguelen, Crozet, Macquarie, Auckland and Antipodes Islands. They may also breed on Marion and Prince Edward Islands and on stacks off Campbell Island. They nest in burrows in peaty soils under tussocks, ferns, low shrubs or in rata forest (Auckland Islands only). The burrows are normally dug in drier soils on well drained slopes but may also be on plateaux or above coastal cliffs. At sea, white-headed petrels forage mainly over cold water between the subantarctic and Antarctic convergence zones, but may move northwards in the non-breeding season during the annual feather moult. They can be seen at sea throughout the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The only accurate estimate of population size for this species was from Macquarie Island (7850 pairs in 1984). Best guesses suggest that 100,000 pairs may breed at both Auckland and Antipodes Islands. Less than 50,000 pairs are thought to occur at the remaining breeding islands, suggesting a world population of about 600,000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The major threat to white-headed petrels, as it is for all gadfly petrels, is the introduction of mammalian predators on their breeding grounds. The colonies on main Auckland Island have been lost to feral cats and pigs. The species probably also bred on Campbell Island in the past before Norway rats and feral cats reached the island. &#xA0;On Macquarie Island, weka, rabbits, ship rats and feral cats greatly reduced the population. Both Campbell and Macquarie Islands have now been cleared of introduced pests.&#xA0; On Kerguelen Island, the colonies are largely present on the pest- free islands in the group. Mice are present on Antipodes Island but their effect on petrels is unknown. However mice on Gough Island are having a major impact on seabirds so there may be undetected problems on Antipodes Island. Removing pests from main Auckland and Antipodes Islands would benefit this species in the long term. The risk to white-headed petrels from fisheries impacts appears to be minimal.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The white-headed petrel breeding season is broadly August to June, with the single large (72 x 51 mm) white egg laid in late November or December and hatched in January-February. The egg is laid in a well-lined nest at the back of a long burrow dug into peaty soil. The birds can breed annually although some birds skip a season if successful in rearing the single chick. Both birds share incubation shifts and feeding of their chick. Incubation takes 55-60 days. The chick is independent of the parents when it fledges at about 102 days old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>White-headed petrels are nocturnally active at their breeding grounds. They are very wary upon landing from flight and will rapidly hide under dense vegetation or quickly enter their burrows. Their activity ashore is more pronounced on dark nights (no moon) or during periods of wet, stormy weather, especially on foggy nights. At sea the birds are mostly solitary. &#xA0;Most calls are given in flight but the birds do also call from within their burrows. They have a loud screaming alarm call if threatened. The species almost never calls on the surface at night. This may be to avoid detection from night-hunting subantarctic skuas, which are the main predators of white-headed petrels. Sex differences in calls have not been described but are likely.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of white-headed petrels is poorly known. They have been recorded feeding on crustaceans (amphipods and shrimps), squid and lantern fishes. There is no information yet on whether the feeding is done mainly by day or at night.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3905\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3905</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. 2004. <em>Albatrosses and petrels across the world</em>.

With provisions running low, their gardens not established and no sign of any ships, they were sustained by harvesting &#x201C;Mount Pitt Birds&#x201D; from the immense colony then on the island. From their life-saving properties these birds were also dubbed the &apos;Bird of Providence&apos; and hence &#x2018;providence petrel&apos;. Surviving records suggest that up to 5000 birds were killed each night, not just the chicks but adults and eggs as well. This level of harvest continued until 1793 after which the settlement was self-sufficient. It is thought that over a million birds were taken. In 1795 they were still &#x201C;in great numbers&#x201D; but cats, rats, mice and pigs running wild on the island probably exterminated them soon after. They have survived on Lord Howe Island, restricted to the summit by pigs, but these have recently been eradicated so that population is expanding. A few pairs were discovered breeding on Phillip Island (Norfolk group) in 1985.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The providence petrel is a large, almost entirely dark greyish-brown gadfly petrel with a pale face, conspicuous white flashes on the underwing near the wingtips, and a long wedge-shaped tail. It has a brown head with a scaly, pale grey face,&#xA0;including the chin, while the rest of the plumage is more grey than brown. The pale patch on the underwing is formed by pale bases to the primaries and the first row of primary coverts. The bill is stout and black, the eye is dark, and the legs and feet are greyish-black.</p>\n<p>Voice: providence petrels are silent at sea, but noisy in flight and on the ground at the breeding colony on Lord Howe Island, with the main flight call a screeching <em>kir-rer-rer-kik-kik-kik</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: grey-faced petrel is similar but does not have a pale under-wing flash. Dark morph Kermadec petrel is smaller, lacks the grey face, and has prominent pale shafts to primaries forming a pale patch on top of the wing as well as below.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>About 32,000 providence petrels breed on Lord Howe Island and there is a relict population of tens of pairs on Phillip Island, offshore from Norfolk Island. At sea they are pelagic and found in deep water from the continental shelf and beyond. During the breeding season (late February-November) many birds feed off eastern Australia from Fraser Island to south-eastern Tasmania. After breeding providence petrels migrate to the central north-eastern Pacific where they may reach the Bering Sea, and concentrate over the convergences of warm and cold currents.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are five accepted records of providence petrels in New Zealand. The first two were dead birds washed ashore: Muriwai, Auckland (January 1921), and Dargaville (September 1984). About five were seen between Macauley and Curtis Islands, Kermadec Islands, in July 2002, one was seen over the shelf edge north-east of Cape Karikari, Northland, in May 2004 and three were seen off North Cape in May 2005.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Pigs and cats extirpated providence petrels from all or part of their range on Norfolk and Lord Howe Island but they can survive in the presence of rats. Cats and pigs have since been eradicated from Lord Howe Island, and there are plans to attempt rat eradication in 2018 or soon after.</p>\n<p>Providence petrels are known to ingest floating plastic debris and some birds swallow hooks on long lines and drown but these do not appear to be major causes of mortality at present.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Providence petrels are mainly solitary at sea, but may gather into flocks of up to 50 birds. Like other gadfly petrels they have an easy flight with few wing beats, except in light winds, with long glides twisting into high arcs above the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Providence petrels&#xA0;mainly eat&#xA0;fish, but squid and crustaceans have also been recorded, and they sometimes feed on offal at fishing boats.

Fewer than 200 are thought to exist. They breed only in dense forests at the southern end of main Chatham Island. Taiko were formerly hunted by early Polynesian settlers but the colonies disappeared to human knowledge about 100 years ago. At sea, one bird was taken as a specimen in 1867 and named the Magenta petrel after the Italian expedition&#x2019;s ship. Bill Bourne made the first connection that the Magenta petrel and the &#x201C;extinct&#x201D; Chatham Island taiko might be the same species. New Zealand ornithologist David Crockett carried out a series of expeditions to the Chatham Islands and rediscovered the species in 1978. Birds captured in flight by spotlighting were tracked using radio transmitters to locate their breeding sites. Very few breeding pairs remain so an intensive conservation programme is run annually to protect this summer-nesting seabird.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island taiko is a medium-sized dark-grey-and-white petrel with a distinctive dark-hooded head, long narrow wings and a long pointed tail. As with other gadfly petrels taiko have large heads, a high forehead, and little neck apparent. The upper surface is uniform dark slate-grey fading to brown with age. The neck and upper breast are also dark. A white chin patch occurs on some birds. The remaining underside is white, including the undertail, and contrasting with the dark-grey underwings. In the hand, the stout black bill (32 mm long and 15 mm deep) has a sharp hook and the tubed nostrils are prominent. The eyes are dark and the legs are pink/white with black patches on the toes.</p>\n<p>Voice: Chatham Island taiko calls are similar to those of soft-plumaged petrels. The main calls are moans (<em>ooooorr </em>and<em> uuuur</em> sounds) plus higher-pitched squeaky calls given in burrows.</p>\n<p>Similar species: many other petrel species can appear &#x2018;hooded&#x2019; at sea, and some have overall plumage pattern almost identical to taiko. Those with only partial hoods (soft-plumaged petrel, Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater and grey petrel) are readily ruled out with adequate views; both Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater and grey petrel have slimmer beaks (not black), smaller heads and longer necks. Soft-plumaged petrel has more extensive pale chin and cheeks, and usually shows a trace of an &apos;M&apos; mark across the upperwings (never apparent in taiko). The remaining four species are all tropical or subtropical and unlikely to be seen near Chatham Islands: Kermadec petrel, Herald petrel, Phoenix petrel and Tahiti petrel. However, Chatham Island taiko range into subtropical waters and may overlap with any or all these species in a swathe between the Coral Sea and Easter Island. Kermadec petrel and Herald petrel are both variable species: both have white flashes on the outer underwing (though taiko underwings can reflect light, and may show white on outer underwing during winter moult), and birds appearing as hooded as taiko are likely to have dark undertails. Phoenix petrel is slightly smaller and slimmer, and usually has a pale stripe along the leading edge of the inner under-wing. Tahiti petrel holds its wings straighter and has languid flight style, compared to most gadfly petrels (including taiko) holding wings slightly flexed, and with rapid, impetuous flight.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island taiko only breed on main Chatham Island. They are confined to forests in the southern tablelands up to 5 km inland from the sea. The breeding burrows are in peaty soil under dense tall forest and tree ferns. The birds nest on slopes and valley floors, usually near water courses. They need to climb trees to get airborne to return to sea. The burrows are widely scattered over thousands of hectares of habitat. At sea the distribution of Chatham Island taiko is now better known thanks to recent tracking studies. During the breeding season, the birds feed mainly south and east of the colonies, ranging thousands of kilometres. During the winter exodus, they disperse widely across the Pacific Ocean from the Tasman Sea to South America, and into tropical seas.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The exact population size of this species is hard to determine as the birds are widely scattered. However repeated captures of birds, marked as adults and chicks at spotlighting sites near the coast, suggests that fewer than 200 remain today. About 20 breeding burrows are currently known.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The major threat to Chatham Island taiko is mammalian predators on their breeding grounds. Feral cats, three species of rat, feral pigs and possums have all been introduced to Chatham Island. Also weka were introduced and are a threat to eggs and chicks. Intensive pest control has been undertaken since 1987 to control all animal threats. Cat control using traps, and rodent poisoning are the main techniques. The Tuku Nature Reserve where most birds breed has been fenced off from feral sheep and cattle. In 2006 a predator fence was built around a hilltop at Sweetwater Covenant and nearly 60 taiko chicks were transferred to there from 2007 to 2011. This should provide a secure breeding site in the long term. The Chatham Island Taiko Trust was formed to help assist with taiko conservation. Ornithological Society volunteers have played a key role in rediscovering and protecting taiko since 1974 (including rediscovery in 1978). Recent research on the conservation genetics of this species has shown that problems caused by breeding with close relatives may be an emerging risk to this small population. There are no major at-sea threats to Chatham Island taiko.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island taiko breeding season is broadly September to June with the single white egg laid in late November or December and hatched in January-February. The egg is laid in a well-lined nest at the back of a long burrow dug into peaty soil. The birds mostly breed annually; very few pairs skip a breeding season. Both partners share incubation shifts and feeding of their chick. The chick is independent of the parents at fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island taiko are nocturnally active at breeding grounds. Video footage shows they can land and enter their burrows within 5 seconds. They often spend 15-30 minutes sitting in burrow entrances checking surroundings before they climb up a tree to depart. Their activity ashore is more pronounced on dark nights during periods of wet weather, especially foggy nights. Very few Chatham Island taiko have been observed at sea but recent tracking studies show they forage over deep water. Calling activity at night is very limited. Many unpaired males are present and finding partners seems to be a problem for this species. The birds are sometimes seen giving moaning calls from burrow entrances in the hope of attracting a mate.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Taiko diet remains poorly known. Fish and squid are the two most commonly regurgitated items. The birds are able to feed both by day and at night.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.taiko.org.nz/\">http://www.taiko.org.nz/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/chatham-island-taiko/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/chatham-island-taiko/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/taikochatham.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/taikochatham.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. 2004. <em>Albatrosses and petrels across the world</em>.

Its variable plumage, along with its distinctive white wing flashes, bulky body and short, squared-off tail give it a skua-like appearance. The Kermadec petrel and similar Herald petrel are thought to mimic foraging skuas, and to use their resemblance of skuas to parasitise other seabirds for their food with more success than they would have otherwise.</p>\n<p>The petrel takes its name from the Kermadec Islands, 1000 km north-east of the North Island of New Zealand. The islands were named in 1793 for Jean-Michel Huon du Kermadec, captain of the French naval ship, <em>Esperance, </em>whose crew were the first Europeans to sight the islands. In addition to its variable plumage, the Kermadec petrel is also unusual in having highly variable breeding times within the same island group. Very large numbers formerly bred during spring-summer (egg-laying in October-February) on Raoul Island, the largest of the Kermadec Islands. This population was extirpated by feral cats and rats between 1920 and 1967. In contrast, on the rat-free Meyer Islets, 2 km off Raoul Island, nests, eggs and chicks are reportedly present in varying numbers all year with a peak of egg-laying during February-March.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Kermadec petrel has a bulky body, long pointed wings, and short, squared-off tail. Its highly variable plumage morphs range from birds with pale heads and underparts to birds that are completely dark. Many intermediate birds have a mid-brown head and upper breast, and white throat and remaining underparts. Birds in the South Pacific are polymorphic while birds at Indian and Atlantic Ocean breeding colonies are reported to be predominantly or exclusively dark. Some birds have pink legs and some have black legs; all have a black stubby bill. All birds have the same predominantly dark grey-brown wings, with white flashes near the end of the underwings and whitish primary shafts visible on the upperwings. Its flight is purposeful and direct, wheeling and banking in long glides interspersed with deep, gull-like wingbeats. They are generally solitary and silent at sea. The sexes are similar with no seasonal variations. Juveniles resemble adults.</p>\n<p>Voice: Kermadec petrels are noisy at colonies, where calls include an explosive <em>yuk-ker-a-oooo-wuk</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the highly variable plumage morphs of the Kermadec petrel can make identification at sea challenging. Other seabirds with white flashes at the base of the primaries include: the very similar Herald petrel (also with highly variable plumage morphs, never with a pale head, and does not have pale primary shafts on the upperwing); the providence petrel is greyer than dark morph Kermadec petrels, with a pale face and brownish head giving it a more hooded appearance. The three <em>Stercorarius </em>skuas have more direct, powerful, falcon-like flight with regular deep wingbeats and little use of soaring or banking (and often have elongated central tail feathers).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Kermadec petrels breed colonially in the South Pacific at the Kermadec Islands, plus Balls Pyramid (Lord Howe), Phillip Island (Norfolk Island), Pitcairn, Austral, Tuamotu, Easter, Juan Fernandez and San Ambrosio Islands, possibly also Rarotonga; in the South Atlantic on Ilha da Trindade; and in the southern Indian Ocean on Round Island. They breed on all the Kermadec Islands apart from Curtis and L&#x2019;Esperance Rock, with the largest population on the islets north-east of Raoul Island. They formerly bred in enormous numbers on Raoul Island, where a few birds may be recolonising following predator eradication.</p>\n<p>Kermadec petrels nest on the ground under vegetation or in rock crevices. They range at sea across the subtropical South Pacific, the southern Indian Ocean, and both the southern and northern Atlantic Ocean. During breeding, birds occur at sea in the vicinity of breeding islands, occasionally south to the subtropical convergence at 44&#xB0;S east of New Zealand but mainly between 20&#xB0;S and 35&#xB0;S. They are rarely seen off the New Zealand mainland. After breeding, some birds migrate north into the central North Pacific to 42&#xB0;N towards Japan and the Aleutian Islands. New Zealand records away from the Kermadec Islands include one regularly at Cuvier Island (1973-1981) and single birds at sea off the Chatham Islands (March 1975),&#xA0;off Kaikoura (January 1999), and in the outer Hauraki Gulf (January 2014). Seven beach-wrecked birds have been recorded from North Island beaches, mostly from Muriwai, with the southernmost in Hawke Bay. Several additional sightings off North Cape have yet to be submitted to the&#xA0;Birds New Zealand&#xA0;Records Appraisal Committee for verification.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The estimated global population of Kermadec petrels is 150,000-200,000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Cats and rats extirpated the formerly enormous population of Kermadec petrels on Raoul Island. Feral goats were eradicated from Raoul and Macauley Islands in 1984 and 1970, respectively. Pacific rats were eradicated from Macauley in 2006 and feral cats and rats from Raoul Island 2002-2006. Since 2009 recordings of seabird calls have been played on automated broadcast equipment on Raoul Island in an attempt to attract Kermadec petrels (with no evidence as yet that this has worked).</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The Kermadec petrel is an annual colonial breeder with a variable breeding season at the Kermadec Islands. Very large numbers formerly bred mainly spring-summer on Raoul Island (egg-laying October-February). In contrast, on the Meyer Islets 2 km off Raoul Island, nests, eggs and chicks are reportedly present in varying numbers all year, with a peak of egg-laying during February-March. The few birds on Macauley Island&#xA0;breed in summer. Most New Zealand information is from the Meyer Islets. Kermadec petrels are monogamous with shared incubation and chick-care. After establishing a nest site on the ground surface, birds leave for 2-3 weeks to feed at sea before females return to lay. The single large (64 x 47 mm) white egg is mainly laid between August and March. Incubation takes 50-52 days, and chick-rearing 110-130 days. The chick is left alone by parents 10-14 days before it fledges.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Kermadec petrels are pelagic, rarely approaching land except to breed. At sea, they are thought to mimic foraging skuas and to use their resemblance of skuas to parasitise other seabirds.&#xA0;When attacking other seabirds in an attempt to take their food it mainly adopts a skua-like, fast and low horizontal flight.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of Kermadec petrels includes squid, fish and crustaceans, taken by surface-seizing, dipping and piracy.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermadec_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermadec_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3898\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3898</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. de L.; Imber, M.J.; Rowe, G. 2000.

Coincidentally, both the bird and the islets were named after the same ship, <em>HMS Herald</em>, which undertook surveys in the south-west Pacific during 1852-61. The Herald petrel was described from two specimens collected on Chesterfield Reef, west of New Caledonia, probably in 1859. This was about 5 years after the vessel (under Captain Henry Mangles Denham) was at the Kermadec Islands. As &#x2018;Herald&#x2019; is a proper noun, the bird&#x2019;s name should always be capitilised.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Herald petrel is medium-sized gadfly petrel, with variable plumage morphs ranging from almost entirely dark (grey-brown ) to birds with grey-brown upperparts and white underparts, with a dark head. It is more lightly built and relatively longer-tailed than the otherwise similar (and even more variable) Kermadec petrel &#x2013; although note that Herald petrels are never as pale as the &#x2018;white-headed&#x2019; pale morph of the Kermadec petrel. Herald petrels of all morphs have dark primary shafts, and so the upper wing appears concolorous (cf. Kermadec petrel). All morphs of Herald petrel have a pale flash at the base of the primaries of the underwing, similar to Kermadec petrel (although the Herald petrel usually has more pale feathering extending on to the inner underwing). Pale morph and intermediate morph birds are the forms most often recorded at breeding sites in the south-west Pacific (and are therefore most likely to reach New Zealand). They have pale bellies and a more-or-less hooded appearance, with brownish plumage on the head and sides of the neck, often joined as a collar, but leaving a pale throat. Pale morph birds have largely white bases to undertail coverts and an indistinct collar, while intermediate morph birds are strongly hooded and typically have dark undertail coverts. Most birds have white on the lores or forehead, unlike the otherwise similar Phoenix petrel. There is no significant plumage variation with age or sex. The bill is black, the eye dark, and the legs and feet pink, with black outer toes and webs.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Herald petrel is difficult to identify due to its variable plumage, plus the similarity of some morphs to several other petrel species. It is very similar to the dark and intermediate morphs of the (also variable) Kermadec petrel. Paler birds are very similar to Phoenix petrels, which differ in having wholly dark foreheads, a more strongly hooded appearance, and darker underwings without a prominent flash at the base of the primaries. Kermadec petrels have pale primary shafts visible on the outer upperwing. Chatham Island taiko is slightly larger, has a darker and more prominent &#x2018;hood&#x2019;, whiter undertail coverts, and silvery underwing that often reflects light. Tahiti petrel is more heavily built with more massive bill (accentuated by a small head and long neck), darker brown plumage, and lacks the pale patch on throat. It&#xA0;also has longer, straighter wings, and flies with a more languid, leisurely style. Dark morph birds are indistinguishable from the Henderson petrel of the eastern tropical Pacific.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Herald petrels are pelagic seabirds of the tropical south Pacific Ocean, that come ashore only to breed. Breeding sites include Raine Island (Queensland), Chesterfield Reefs (New Caledonia), &#x2018;Ata, Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha&#x2019;apai (Tonga), Ta&#x2019;u (American Samoa), Ua Pou and Tahuata (Marquesas), Gambier, Henderson and Ducie Islands (Pitcairn Islands). At sea, Herald petrels mainly range south of the equator, from northern Queensland to the vicinity of Easter Island, but may range north to 39&#xB0;N in the central Pacific. </p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The sole New Zealand record was an intermediate morph bird seen and photographed off the Meyer Islets (Herald Islets, Kermadec Islands) on 29 Mar 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Herald petrels exhibit typical gadfly petrel behaviour at sea, flying in high-banked arcs and glides, with wings angled forward and swept back at the carpal joint (cf. the more straight-winged Tahiti petrel). They visit breeding islands by day, nesting in a crevice or a surface scrape under trees or low vegetation, from near sea level to 1000 m. The single white egg is incubated by both parents, who also share care of the chick. The breeding season is variable with location; adults present at most colonies year-round (absent from Raine Island Nov-Jan).</p>\n<p>A bird banded on Raine Island in 1984 was recovered on Round Island, Mauritius in 2006.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Little known, but includes squid (86% of 29 samples), insects (59%), fish (24%) and crustaceans (10%) taken from or near the sea surface.

It has twice been recorded at the Kermadec Islands (1913 &amp; 1982), and is otherwise unknown from the New Zealand region. Like several other tropical petrel species, it nests on the ground surface, rather than in a burrow. This is thought to be due to the absence of aerial predators (skuas, hawks, falcons and owls) on most small tropical islands. Petrels that nest in temperate latitudes, including New Zealand, are almost all burrow nesters.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Phoenix petrel is medium-sized &#x2018;hooded&#x2019; gadfly petrel, with the dark head clearly demarcated from the white underparts. The head, back, throat and upper breast are dark greyish- or chocolate-brown. The lower breast, belly and undertail are white, with some dark flecks under the tail. The chin and upper throat pale. The underwing is dark brown, with a pale strip along the leading edge of the inner wing, and usually with a second irregular pale strip along the centre of the underwing. These markings are similar to those of Chatham Island taiko, Tahiti petrel, intermediate morph Kermadec petrel, and pale morph Herald petrel (latter not yet recorded from New Zealand).

Pale morph Herald petrels (<em>Pterodroma heraldica</em> &#x2013; not recorded from New Zealand) differ in having prominent white scaling on the forehead, a less complete dark band across the upper breast, and pale bases to the primary feathers on the outer underwing. Intermediate morph Kermadec petrels have pale bases to the primary feathers on the outer underwing, plus prominent pale primary shafts visible on the outer upperwing. Chatham Island taiko is slightly larger, usually has white on the forehead or above the eye, has whiter undertail coverts, and silvery underwing that often reflects light.

The few known breeding sites are on low coral atolls (Oeno Island, Pitcairn group), raised coral atolls (Kanton Island, Phoenix Islands, and Kiritimati, Line Islands) or high volcanic islands (Ua Pu, Fatu Huku and Hatutu, all in the Marquesas Islands). They formerly also bred on Ducie and Henderson Islands (Pitcairn group). The Phoenix petrel possibly breeds in the Tuamotu and Tongan Islands. At sea, Phoenix petrels range north to Hawaii, east to Galapagos, west to Fiji, and presumably south-west to Kermadec waters.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Four birds were seen by William (King) Bell on the forest floor of Raoul Island (Kermadec Islands) on the night of 7 March 1913.

The only breeding population in New Zealand occurs on the Antipodes Islands, where they were discovered to be present in 1969. Soft-plumaged petrels prefer to nest under dense fern and tussocks around the fringe of the island, perhaps to avoid predation by&#xA0;subantarctic skuas. Over land the birds are best known by their distinctive moaning calls in flight as they are quite cryptic when on the ground. At sea, soft-plumaged petrels range widely over deep water east of New Zealand. They often follow ships but only those sailing well offshore.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The soft-plumaged petrel is a medium-sized dark-grey-and-white gadfly petrel (tube-nosed seabird) with narrow wings and a pointed tail in flight. It has a dark grey head with prominent white feathers on the cheeks and throat, and white speckling on the forehead. There is a prominent dark eye patch. The upper surface is even dark-grey with darker brown-black feathers running across the upper wings and rump in an M-shape The underside is mostly white on the body but with dark grey underwings. The dark neck collar can create a hooded appearance from a distance. In the hand, the black bill (25-32 mm long) has a sharp hook to seize prey. The legs are pink with black on the outer webs and toes.</p>\n<p>Voice: the calls of soft-plumaged petrels are quite distinctive with medium-pitched musical moans and shrill squeaks.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Chatham Island taiko (very rare) is larger with darker head plumage and underwing, and no obvious M-shape on&#xA0;upperwing). White-headed petrel is larger with an all-white head with no collar, and is paler grey on the upper body.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Soft-plumaged petrels breed in small colonies on Antipodes Island and occasionally prospect on the Chatham Islands. Elsewhere they breed on various subantarctic islands in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and recently have been recorded from several islands south of Australia. They nest in burrows amongst tussocks, ferns or low shrubs on Antipodes Island. The breeding burrows are normally dug on well-drained slopes in dry peaty soils. Soft-plumaged petrels forage over cold water north of 55&#xB0;S, mainly over deep water beyond the continental shelf. After the breeding season, they migrate to the central South Pacific to complete their annual feather moult.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are no robust estimates of population size from the breeding islands. The best guess is about 5 million birds. The population on Antipodes Island is possibly about 2500-5000 pairs but needs a definitive survey. The largest population (millions of pairs) occurs on Gough Island in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The main threat to soft-plumaged petrels, as for all gadfly petrels, is the introduction of mammalian predators to their breeding grounds. Currently the only introduced mammal on Antipodes Island is the house mouse, and there is no evidence at present that this rodent affects soft-plumaged petrels. The risk to soft-plumaged petrels from fisheries impacts appears to be minimal.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The soft-plumaged petrel breeding season is from September to May with the single large (59 x 43 mm) white egg laid from early to mid- December and hatched in January. The egg is laid in a well-lined nest at the back of a fairly long burrow (1-1.5 m long). There have been no detailed studies on the breeding biology of this species.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Soft-plumaged petrels are nocturnally active at breeding grounds. Their activity ashore is more pronounced on dark nights (no moon) or during periods of wet, stormy weather. The birds can be quite noisy when flying over the islands and call repeatedly, with many birds engaged in aerial chases. There is very little calling on the surface and birds are quite subdued even in burrows. This makes it very difficult to locate birds once they land. At sea the birds range widely away from the breeding colonies. They are occasionally seen following in the wake of ships. The soft-plumaged petrel seems to forage only over deep water beyond the continental shelf and are rarely seen close to land, except near breeding colonies. They forage over seas with a wide range of temperatures, from sub-antarctic seas to warmer sub-tropical seas in the winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Soft-plumaged petrel diet is poorly known. They have been recorded feeding on squid, crustaceans and small fish. There is no information yet on whether the feeding is done mainly by day or at night.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3908\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3908</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1036\">http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1036</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. 2004. <em>Albatrosses and petrels across the world</em>.

Imber&#x2019;s petrel is known only from fossil bones that are up to a few thousand years old. Despite New Zealand having high extinction rates and being the &#x2018;seabird capital of the world&#x2019;, only three recently extinct seabirds are known from the region: Waitaha penguin, Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwater and now Imber&#x2019;s petrel.&#xA0; Imber&#x2019;s petrel is one of only four known extinct <em>Pterodroma</em> petrels worldwide, with species described also from St. Helena (<em>Pt. rupinarum</em>), Aldabra Atoll (<em>Pt. kurodai</em>) and Hawaii (<em>Pt. rupinarum</em>). Little is known about Imber&#x2019;s petrel as there are no records of it being seen alive. The species was named in honour of Dr Michael Imber (1940-2011), a former NZ Department of Conservation scientist with a passion for petrel conservation, ecology and taxonomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Imber&#x2019;s petrel was a medium-sized gadfly petrel, being slightly larger than the soft-plumaged petrel.&#xA0; It was a well-differentiated species, having diverged from its closest relatives around 1.37 million years ago (calculated using a molecular clock).&#xA0; Imber&#x2019;s petrel probably had proportionately longer legs than similar species but its skeleton is not well known. Most of the close relatives of Imber&#x2019;s petrel are dark above and white below, so perhaps this extinct species had similar plumage colours.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fossil bones of Imber&#x2019;s petrel have been found on main Chatham Island, Pitt Island and Mangere Island, in both natural and archaeological sites. It&#x2019;s remains have been found at the same sites as the remains of the other Chatham Island endemic gadfly petrels (Magenta petrel and Chatham petrel), so evidently all three species once lived alongside each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The abundance of the bones of Imber&#x2019;s petrel indicates that it was formerly common and widespread in the Chatham Islands archipelago.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Imber&#x2019;s petrel probably survived until at least the end of the nineteenth century as cats are the most likely cause of its extinction on Pitt and Mangere Islands and cats were only released on these islands in the mid to late nineteenth century. &#xA0;In addition, the species may have suffered from human hunting, and on main Chatham Island from predation by rats.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is known about the breeding biology of Imber&#x2019;s petrel but, no doubt like most of its relatives, it nested in burrows and laid a single egg each year.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is known of the behaviour or ecology of Imber&#x2019;s petrel but like all gadfly petrels it would have been capable of travelling thousands of miles at sea to feed and evidently occupied a different ecological niche to its Chatham Island relatives, the Magenta petrel and Chatham petrel. The extinction of Imber&#x2019;s petrel may have freed up an ecological niche, allowing the soft-plumaged petrel to colonise the New Zealand region.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Gadfly petrels primarily eat squid, fish and marine invertebrates, so it can be assumed that Imber&#x2019;s petrel had a similar diet.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2015/10/21/introducing-imbers-petrel-a-new-recently-extinct-seabird-species-for-new-zealand/\">http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2015/10/21/introducing-imbers-petrel-a-new-recently-extinct-seabird-species-for-new-zealand/</a><a name=\"_GoBack\" id=\"_GoBack\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imber%27s_petrel\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imber%27s_petrel</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bourne, W.R.P. 1967.

Acclimatisation Societies subsequently bred and released over 30,000 mallards throughout New Zealand until 1974, by which time the mallard had become the most common waterfowl in the country. Extensive hybridisation with the native grey duck followed soon after their initial release and the mallard competitively excluded grey ducks from most wetlands, especially those in and near urban environments and in pastoral landscapes. As a consequence of both their gamefarm origin and hybridisation, the plumages of New Zealand&#x2019;s mallards are highly variable, especially the females, and males in breeding plumage are duller and less striking than wild northern hemisphere mallards.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Mallards are the ducks that gather en masse whenever bread is thrown out at an urban pond. Drakes are about 10% larger than females. In breeding plumage, drakes have the head and neck glossy dark green, separated from the maroon breast by a thin white collar. The back and flanks are pale grey, and the rump and undertail blackish, with curled black upper tail coverts. The secondary flight feathers are metallic blue, forming a &#x2018;speculum&#x2019; on the trailling edge of the inner upper-wing. The speculum has thin black then slightly broader white edges at front and rear. The underwing is white. The bill is yellowish, the eye dark, and legs and feet bright orange. Females are dull brown with feathers edged with buff, and have an indistinct dark eye-stripe on an otherwise featureless face. The bill is brownish-grey, orange at base, sides and tip and the legs and feet orange. The wing pattern and leg colour are the same as for males. Males in eclipse resemble females, but with head and neck greyish, retaining some green, and the breast chestnut. Juveniles resemble females. The plumage of New Zealand mallards is highly variable due to hybridisation with grey ducks, and also many domesticated mallard varieties that have escaped into the wild population.</p>\n<p>Voice: Female gives typical decrescendo call of about 6-8 loud quacks in a row, soft quacks in communication with ducklings, and a rapid &#x201C;gag gag gag&#x201D; repulsion call in courting displays and when pursued by males. Males give soft &#x201C;raeb raeb&#x201D; call of variable length.</p>\n<p>Similar species: females are easily confused with grey ducks from which they can be distinguished by leg colour, bill colour and pattern, less diffuse eye and bill stripes and their more mottled face. Hybrids with grey duck are confusingly variable in most characteristics, especially in face patterning of females. A narrow white or pale fawn anterior speculum stripe (alar bar) on the wing is indicative of recent hybrid ancestry.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Mallards occur throughout all of New Zealand and on all vegetated subantarctic islands, Chatham Islands and Kermadec Islands and extending to Lord Howe Island (where many are now hybrids with Pacific black duck = grey duck). They are most numerous in pastoral environments and in and around urban areas. Expansion, and displacement of grey duck, is ongoing in southern Westland and Fiordland. Elsewhere mallards have more-or-less completely supplanted grey ducks.</p>\n<p>Mallards utilise a wide range of habitats from urban streams and public parks to isolated lakes, drains in pastoral areas to most slow flowing rivers, lowland lakes and hydro-dams to alpine tarns, and estuaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The mallard is New Zealand&#x2019;s most numerous and widely distributed waterfowl. There are no credible estimates of the total population.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The mallard is a legal gamebird that is hunted during the annual May-June waterfowl season. Fish &amp; Game New Zealand estimate that approximately 500,000 mallards are shot each year; this number undoubtedly including mallard-like hybrids.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Mallard mature rapidly and can breed in their first year. They are seasonally monogamous, with all incubation and duckling care contributed by the female. When breeding, they are dispersed on ill-defined territories where the male&#x2019;s defence is entirely concentrated on female protection and guarding in the lead up to her laying and commencing incubation. Thereafter males seek additional mating opportunities by pursuing any female still appearing gravid. Laying mainly occurs from late July to September, with renesting, if necessary, in October - early November. In urban areas, mallards may raise 2 broods a year. Nests are situated on the ground under cover, seldom far from water, the nest bowl being accumulated debris at the site lined with plucked breast feathers and down. The clutch of 10-13 pale green eggs hatches after 27-28 days of incubation. The ducklings leave the nest as soon as all are dry, and follow the female closely, though feeding themselves. They fledge at about 7-9 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Mallards are typically associated with waters in proximity to human activity but will also occur on remote lakes and headwater rivers. They form large flocks in December&#x2013;March when moulting, although females may also moult secretively in lakeside vegetation. Although strong fliers, mallards tend to be quite sedentary, and widespread dispersal or movements are uncommon. Birds occasionally&#xA0;cross&#xA0;the Tasman Sea to reach Australia and nearby islands e.g.&#xA0;from Otago to Adelaide, and Waikato to Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia and Vanuatu.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Mallards are both wetland and dry land feeders. They consume mostly plant material, including seeds, grains, grasses, clovers, tips of most aquatic plants, bread, and human food scraps including McDonald&#x2019;s fries. Animal foods, consumed whenever available, include a wide range of insect larvae and adults, freshwater snails and worms, and estuarine invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fishandgame.org.nz/mallard-duck\">http://www.fishandgame.org.nz/mallard-duck</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/mallard-duck/\">http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/mallard-duck/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Balham, R.W. 1952.

They have disappeared from all subantarctic islands, and are now rare on the Chatham Islands and much diminished on mainland New Zealand. The 1999-2004 Ornithological Society of New Zealand atlas scheme showing grey ducks to still be widespread is erroneous and clearly confused grey duck with hybrids and mallards.</p>\n<p>The best opportunity to view grey duck is in forested headwater catchments and away from human settlements (where mallards and hybrids occur), in Northland, West Coast (South Island) and Fiordland.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Pure grey ducks are now considered rare but no credible population estimates have been made.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Although critically rare it remains a gamebird and can be legally hunted during the annual waterfowl season (May-June). Because of its similarity to mallard both on the wing and in the hand, as well as uncertainty about characteristics of hybrids, only a cessation of all duck hunting will prevent it from being shot.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Grey ducks are seasonally monogamous, with all incubation and duckling care contributed by the female. During the breeding season they are dispersed on ill-defined territories where the male&#x2019;s defence is more concentrated on female protection and guarding rather than of space. They lay mainly during August to October. Nests are situated on the ground under cover or in tree forks or epiphytes, the bowl being accumulated debris at the site lined with plucked breast feathers and down. The clutch of 8-10 whitish to pale green eggs is incubated for 26-29 days. The ducklings leave the nest as soon as the brood is dry, and accompany the female for about 7-9 weeks, but feed themselves from the outset. Grey ducks can breed in their first year.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey ducks are nowadays typically associated with undisturbed waters rather than those in close proximity to human activity. Remote lakes and headwater rivers with forested or scrub fringes are preferred. They may occasionally occur in flocks with mallards but are usually encountered as singles or in pairs, and are timid and easily spooked. Grey ducks disperse widely, but mostly occur in &#x201C;wild&#x201D; rather than pastoral landscapes.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The grey duck is a wetland feeder (cf. mallard also on dry land), consuming mostly plant material, including seeds and soft tips of most aquatic plant species.

Fine lamellae extend along most of the edge of the upper mandible and it is by pushing water through this lamellae curtain that small plankton and fine seeds are extracted.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Australasian shovelers are sexually dimorphic. The males are highly coloured most of the year, when they have a blue-grey head and neck with a distinctive white crescentic band at the base of its large spatulate black bill. The breast is a mottled brown and white after breeding but becomes progressively pure white as the nuptial moult proceeds during May.

Females are essentially indistinguishable but males in nuptial plumage have a green head and prominent white breast.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Australasian shovelers are widespread throughout the North and South Islands, rarely on Stewart Island. They are no longer resident on the Chatham Islands, but reach there occasionally as vagrants, and also once to the Snares Islands (May 1997) and Auckland Islands (Cape Expedition, World War II).</p>\n<p>Shovelers mainly occur on large freshwater wetlands but may also be encountered in sheltered estuaries and brackish lakes. They also make seasonal use of dune lakes, temporary wetlands, and sewage ponds.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are no reliable national estimates for the Australasian shoveler population, but it is probably in the order of 15 - 30,000 birds. Fish &amp; Game New Zealand&#x2019;s annual survey of about 250 lakes nationwide to monitor population trend recorded a small and steady decline over 2000-2011.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The Australasian shoveler is a gamebird with an estimated annual kill of 6500 (2011), half of which usually occurs in Otago and Southland. Eutrophication of lowland wetlands has probably provided more feeding habitat, but intensive pastoral farming has undoubtedly diminished breeding habitat.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Shovelers perform spectacular communal courting at selected and traditional lakes in July and August, at which time flocks comprise approx. 60% males. Pairs prospect small and secluded ponds and drains as breeding and feeding territories, and nesting occurs in October, which is later than for all other waterfowl. Males vigorously defend territory and mate until the female has completed about half of her incubation period of 24 days. Nests are usually situated in long grass near water. Clutches are of 5-13 (mean 10) whitish eggs and, upon hatching, the ducklings are raised solely by the female over about 8 weeks. Broods are rarely active or conspicuous during the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The Australasian shoveler is a highly mobile species with many birds probably traversing the length of New Zealand annually before returning again to their breeding areas. Survival rates (0.61 - 0.72 per annum for males, 0.40 - 0.51 for females) and extent of movements are influenced by the phase and intensity of the El Ni&#xF1;o Southern Oscillation weather system. For example, for shoveler breeding and moulting in Waikato, El Ni&#xF1;o conditions induce lower survival and increased movement out of the district, whereas similar conditions are associated with higher survival and decreased movement of birds in Otago and Southland. The reverse applies under La Nina conditions.</p>\n<p>Like other shoveler species, Australasian shovelers moult communally in large numbers at very few places and generally occur in flocks for most of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Australasian shovelers feed mostly by filtering surface water or mud through their bill lamellae. They occasionally will upend to feed on the wetland floor. A wide range of small freshwater molluscs, crustaceans and insects are taken and small seeds of many aquatic plants also. Most feeding is done in open water rather than at the wetland margin.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Shoveler\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Shoveler</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/ashoveler.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/ashoveler.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Barker, R.J.; Caithness, T.; Williams, M. 2005.

In flight the upper forewing is pale blue-grey, with a dark green speculum on the trailing margin of the wing, similar to the wing pattern of the Australasian shoveler. Female northern shovelers, and males in eclipse, would be very similar to Australasian shovelers. No characters have been identified to separate the species in these plumages.

The drake Australasian shoveler has a blue-grey head with a vertical white crescent at the base of bill. But note that male northern shovelers in &#x2018;eclipse&#x2019; plumage (a plumage attained for a short time after the breeding season) also may show a pale crescent on the face, as well as a speckled breast. The drake mallard has a similarly green head but has a dark maroon-brown breast and yellow bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The northern shoveler is a long-distance migrant, that breeds across the entire Northern Hemisphere. It spends the northern winter mainly in the northern tropics and warm temperate areas immediately to the north. Asian populations winter throughout East Asia south to Thailand, with occasional records further south including Borneo and Australia. The East Asian population is estimated at 500,000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are 10 accepted northern shoveler records from New Zealand, and several other sightings that have not been assessed. All but two records were from the North Island (particularly the Bay of Plenty and Horowhenua), and all but one were of the readily recognisable drake (there was a pair at Pauri Lake, Whanganui, in August 1989). &#xA0;All New Zealand records were during the southern winter (March to August), when northern shovelers should be on their breeding grounds. The preponderance of records in May, and particularly the first week of May, has more to do with the timing of the duck-shooting season in New Zealand than the migratory behaviour of the birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>It is likely that shovelers are suffering from habitat loss and degradation in Asia.

Maori were aware of it, giving it the name karakahia. It now breeds only in Australia, but regularly ranges to the north, including to Indonesia (one breeding record), New Guinea, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Norfolk Island. It is Australia&#x2019;s only true diving duck and exhibits similar behaviour to the New Zealand scaup.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Both male and female Australian white-eyed ducks are uniform chocolate-brown with rufous flanks, an irregular white patch on the belly and a white undertail. The male has a distinctive white eye and a prominent white bar across the upper mandible of its bill. This white band is more subdued in the female, which has brown eyes. In flight, the white primary and secondary wing feathers produce a similar broad white wing trailing edge to the wing as seen in New Zealand scaup, but extending right to the body. Compared to a mallard, the Australian white-eyed duck is small with a rotund body that is adapted for deep diving. The bill is comparatively short with a black hook at the tip of the upper mandible.</p>\n<p>Voice: generally silent, but when breeding the male has a wheezy whistle, and the female a harsh rattle.</p>\n<p>Similar species: New Zealand scaup are of similar structure and behaviour but are smaller, darker and more compact, with dark undertail coverts. Scaup lack a pale saddle on the bill, and males have a yellow iris. In flight, the white wing bar on scaup stops short of the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian white-eyed duck is a diving duck, and prefers large expanses of deep still water where it can dive for the water weeds and aquatic invertebrates that constitute its diet. It is mainly found in the south-east of Australia, particularly along the Murray-Darling watershed. It can make deep dives of longer than a minutes&#x2019; duration. Australian white-eyed ducks are very proficient swimmers, propelled by powerful webbed feet placed far back on their body. The positioning of the legs makes it difficult for this duck to walk or perch. They spend nearly their whole life on freshwater, and are rarely seen on land or in coastal marine areas.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There were many records of Australian white-eyed duck in the late 1800s, mainly from the North Island, and including Lake Whangape (1867), Lake Waikare (1868), Rotomahana (1868), Lake Ellesmere (before 1888), Lake Te Aute, Hawkes Bay (1888), Lake Tutira (1895), Lake Wairarapa Manawatu and Otago (all 1867-1895). More recently they have been recorded at Hamurana (1934), Runanga Lake, Hawke&apos;s Bay (8 in May 1973), Western Springs, Auckland (April 1980), Snares Islands (August-September 1981), Lake Ryan, Cobden (2 in February 1994), New Plymouth (October 2001), Bromley oxidation ponds, Christchurch (December 2005), Kaiapoi Lakes (April 2012, and again&#xA0;March 2013), Foxton Beach (November 2013), and Blenheim waste water treatment plant (April 2015).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Australian white-eyed ducks tend to stay in areas of favourable habitat, but when drought threatens, they will migrate great distances. This urge to find water is one of the reasons for their &#x201C;vagrant&#x201D; distribution throughout Indonesia, and Oceania. When conditions are favourable in Australia, such as high rainfall years that create large wetlands and inland lakes, the Australian white-eyed duck is less nomadic and they breed in large numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Australian white-eyed ducks are extremely aquatic, including courting and mating on the water (during which the female becomes fully submerged). They have a strong pair bond, with the male calling loudly to protect his territory and mate. The 9-13 whitish eggs are laid in a shallow bowl of sedge or grass leaves, sparsely lined with down, among dense vegetation near open water. The female incubates unaided, which takes 25-30 days.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, white-eyed ducks dive for water weeds and invertebrates. They will also dabble for food items in shallow water and mud.

Compact and blackish, they have the silhouette of a bath-toy duck. Large approachable flocks are a feature of the Rotorua and Queenstown lakeshores, and scaup are also common on the Avon River that flows through Christchurch.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand scaup are quite unlike any other resident duck species. Dark and squat with a rounded profile, they often occur in large flocks, floating with cork-like buoyancy. Scaup are diving ducks and spend a lot of time underwater, where they can travel considerable distances. Both sexes are dark-plumaged, but are easily distinguished. The male has dark black-brown plumage with iridescent blue-green head and wings, and lighter mottling on the chest and underparts. His iris is yellow and bill blue-grey. The female is a duller chocolate brown, paler on her underparts. Her iris is brown and bill grey, normally with a ring of white feathers at the base. Juvenile resemble females until 12 weeks-old when the male iris colour becomes yellow. In flight, all birds have a broad white upper-wing bar and pale white underwing. Scaup have a fast wing beat and often fly just above the water. They sometimes rest on land, but quickly retreat to water when disturbed.</p>\n<p>Voice: males have a high pitched whistle call <em>weeee weo-weo weo-weo weo-weoooo</em>. The female call is a low quiet <em>wack wack</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: brown teal are a similar size but have a long, flat body. Vagrant Australian white-eyed ducks are larger and have white undertail coverts. Males also have white eyes and both sexes have a pale saddle on the upper mandible. Australian coots are similar in body size, shape, colouration and diving behaviour, but have a bright white bill and frontal shield.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand scaup are widely but patchily distributed throughout the North and South Islands. They are found on dune lakes in Northland and Manawatu, and on inland lakes in Waikato, Taupo, Rotorua and Hawke&#x2019;s Bay. In the South lsland they are common on West Coast lakes, north Canterbury waterways (including Christchurch), and eastern and southern high country and hydroelectric lakes. They are common on large, deep, freshwater lakes, including hydro-electric lakes, and are becoming increasingly common on shallow lowland lakes, slow flowing rivers and salt water. They are not found on Stewart Island, and are no longer present on Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p>Scaup often congregate in sheltered areas near willows or reed beds, moving as wind conditions change; although they have favoured locations. They are considered non-migratory despite being capable fliers. Their numbers can fluctuate greatly on otherwise preferred lakes, suggesting at least some localised seasonal movements. Movement is also driven by ice conditions during winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand scaup population was estimated at 20,000 birds in the 1990s. This may have increased following the range and population expansion reported in Canterbury.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Populations apparently declined during late 1800s and early 1900s due to land clearance, associated hydrological changes, predation and hunting. Adults and chicks are vulnerable to predation during nesting and chick-rearing which may result in low breeding success. Predator control and provision of suitable feeding and breeding habitat has led to population expansion at Bromley Oxidation Ponds and Te Huingi Manu Wildlife Refuge in Christchurch. The success of this one site has probably allowed the recolonisation of the wider Christchurch area.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The nest is well concealed on the ground close to the water. Nests may be partially open above, or covered, or have a tunnel leading to a concealed chamber. The nest is a tidy bowl consisting of the surrounding materials, and lined with a layer of down. Breeding mainly occurs between October and March. They nest solitary or in a loose colony. Only females incubate and care for young, but solitary males, or groups of males are often reported close to breeding sites. Chicks often form cr&#xE8;ches.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>There have been few studies on the behaviour or ecology of scaup. They are social, and can form dense rafts especially in autumn and winter and are often associated with other species particularly coots, shoveler and crested grebes. A range of male courtship behaviours were documented by Stoke (1991) including &#x201C;sneak&#x201D; (neck extended), &#x201C;head-flicks&#x201D; (rapid upwards head and bill movement) and &#x201C;kink-neck&#x201D; (neck held at unusual angle). Aggressive displays occur between courting males. Several males attend females until a bond has established, the bonded male will defend the female and they separate themselves from the group. Pairs form at the breeding site and last only until the female begins nesting when the bond apparently breaks. Females have been recorded laying in the nests of other females at one well-studied population (Lake Clearwater, inland Canterbury)</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Scaup obtain most of their food by diving. Prey items include snails, chironomid larvae and caddisfly larvae. Plant material is probably taken also.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Scaup\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Scaup</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://terranature.org/duckScaup.htm\">http://terranature.org/duckScaup.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/papango.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/papango.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Crossland, A.C. 2010.

It has a slender neck, sharp black bill and head with a distinctive black double crest and bright chestnut and black cheek frills, which it uses in its complex and bizarre mating displays. It is unusual for the way it carries its young on its back when swimming. The crested grebe belongs to an ancient order of diving water birds found on every continent in the world. They are rarely seen on land except when they clamber onto their nests on the lake shore. The Australasian crested grebe occurs in New Zealand and Australia but it is threatened in both countries and the New Zealand population probably numbers fewer than 1000 birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crested grebes are moderate sized water birds that may be mistaken for waterfowl or shags at a distance. Both sexes have a long, slender neck, fine black bill and head with a distinctive black double crest and bright chestnut and black cheek frills. The upper plumage is a dark chestnut-brown, the under parts silvery white, and the wings have a distinctive white patches that are only seen in flight. Females generally have more white above the eye, a shorter bill, a slimmer neck, and smaller cheek frills. Unlike birds in Europe,&#xA0;Australasian crested grebes&#xA0;appear to retain full breeding plumage throughout the year;&#xA0;duller birds without crests are probably young of the year. The feet have a peculiar lobed structure and are set relatively far back on the body &#x2013; a design to increase the efficiency and speed of diving. The head and neck of the young are striped black-and-white and the body plumage is grey.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice:&#xA0;a range of loud growling, grunting and barking calls that travel far across water.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the other New Zealand grebes (dabchick, Australasian little grebe and hoary-headed grebe) are all very small in comparison and lack the head crests and tippets. At a distance could be confused with black or little shags, which have a similar silhouette and diving behaviour. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crested grebes occur throughout Europe and central Asia, Africa, southern Australia and New Zealand. They also winter in parts of southern Asia. In New Zealand, crested grebes occur widely in the South Island but are extinct in the North Island (although occasional birds are seen there). They occur on up to 100 lakes from small tarns to large glacial lakes, with their strong holds in the Canterbury and Otago high country. They are rarer and have declined significantly in Nelson, Marlborough, West Coast and Fiordland, but have recently began nesting on the coast in Canterbury, where their numbers are increasing. They forage in a variety of shallow lakes, but require lakes fringed with rushes, sedges, reeds or willows to nest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand population is currently increasing after reaching a low of about 200 birds in the 1980s. The population increased to about 400 birds in 2004 and 600 birds in 2012, largely reflecting increases in numbers on high country lakes in Otago and the Mackenzie Basin and coastal Canterbury. While there has been no recent census, numbers in Otago alone now exceed 600 birds. The combined population in Australia and New Zealand is likely to be less than 3000 birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In New Zealand, crested grebes are threatened because of predation by introduced mammals such as stoats and ferrets, loss of shore-line nesting habitat, the establishment of hydro-electric power schemes and disturbance by power boating and perhaps other recreational activities on lakes. Competition with introduced fish may have been a factor causing early declines. Some predator control has been initiated around lakes in order to improve nesting success. Artificial nesting platforms have been used with great success to establish a population at Lake Wanaka.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nesting occurs between September and March. The nest is generally made of sticks and waterweeds and floats on the water, but is often attached to willow branches or reeds. The female lays 5-7 eggs that are covered with weed when not being incubated. Both sexes incubate and they both care for the young, which are often carried on the back when small. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some crested grebes migrate locally in winter, moving from small lakes when they freeze to larger ones or moving from the high country to coastal Canterbury. They are renown for their highly ritualised courtship displays such as head shaking that shows their head crests off well, the &#x2018;weed dance&#x2019; where they dive and offer each other water weed, the &#x2018;ghostly penguin&#x2019; where they rise chest to chest while &#x2018;walking&#x2019; on water and the growling &#x2018;cat display&#x2019;.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Primarily feeds on fish but also takes aquatic invertebrates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/about-doc/concessions-and-permits/conservation-revealed/australian-crested-grebe-kamana-lowres.pdf\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/about-doc/concessions-and-permits/conservation-revealed/australian-crested-grebe-kamana-lowres.pdf</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3639\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3639</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/great-crested-grebe/podiceps-cristatus/\">http://www.arkive.org/great-crested-grebe/podiceps-cristatus/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/reflecting-on-grebes/\">https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/reflecting-on-grebes/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://otagomuseum.nz/blog/great-crested-grebes-of-lake-wanaka/\">http://otagomuseum.nz/blog/great-crested-grebes-of-lake-wanaka/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jensen, L.

Chicks hatch with irregular heavy black-brown horizontal striped markings on a white background, and a bright red bill with black markings. Juveniles retain striped markings on the head and neck until adult plumage develops; bill becomes black with age.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: adults give short chattering calls during breeding season and occasionally when alarmed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: similar sized hoary-headed grebe has generally lighter plumage and less rufous colouring. Markedly smaller Australasian little grebe has black neck, rufous facial feathering and small pale yellow gape-patch at the base of the bill.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The dabchick has a patchy distribution in the North Island from Northland to Wairarapa. Most birds inhabit freshwater lakes and ponds on the volcanic plateau, Rotorua Lakes area, Northland, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and Wairarapa. Formerly widespread in the South Island, it declined through the 1800s and 1900s until becoming extinct there as a breeding species in the 1940s. In 2012, a pair&#xA0;began breeding&#xA0;near Takaka in the north-west of the South Island, and a pair bred near Blenheim in 2015. Breeding birds favour shallow waters with dense vegetation on small freshwater lakes and pools, sand-dune lakes and lagoons, and larger inland lakes with shallow, sheltered inlets up to the size of Lake Taupo, from sea level to 740 m altitude. Non-breeding birds flock on more open freshwater bodies.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Estimated at 1,900-2,000 individuals.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The small fragmented population is probably declining due to continued threats. Reasons for the decline are not fully understood, but predation by introduced predators is likely to have been a factor along with declining water quality, loss of natural habitat and increased disturbance. Extensive and widespread wetland drainage in the past reduced the availability of suitable natural habitat, although since 1940s more artificial habitat has become available such as farm dams and stock water supplies. Nests on lakes are vulnerable to increased disturbance by boats, jet-skiers and water-skiers. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Breeds year round. Territorial displays begin June-July with egg-laying mainly during August-February. Solitary pairs nest on freshwater lakes and pools, anchoring the nest to aquatic vegetation or building it in a small cave, partially underwater. The nest is a loose pile of aquatic vegetation up to 1 m deep from lake bed to water surface. Elaborate courtship involves preening, rearing, head-turning and -shaking, and ritualised displays of diving and pattering. Monogamous; 2-3 bluish eggs laid August-March, staining brown in nest. Incubation takes 22-23 days, and chick-rearing about 70 days, with both parents assisting. Chicks ride on parents&apos; backs for the first week and much of the subsequent two weeks until they become too big to carry by the fourth week. Juvenile continues to be fed by parental birds until c.70 days. Second nestings recorded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Like other grebes,&#xA0;the New Zealand&#xA0;dabchick has a submarine-like ability to change its buoyancy, which it does by adjusting the angle at which its dense waterproof feathers are held against the body. Aggressive territorial behaviour directed at intruders includes the head being lowered forward, neck and back arched, half-raising of wings, and short rushes or low pattering flights towards the intruding bird. Appeasement display includes head-bobbing up and down, side to side, or back and forth, with diving as a last resort to escape. Uses &quot;stern-on&quot; posture that involves raising of the rear-end and fluffing up of rump feathers to display a white &apos;owl-face&apos; pattern on each side of the tail feathers. This is thought to be a territorial advertisement that may also convey mild alarm in the presence of a potential threat. Mostly flies at night with birds able to cross large water bodies, including Cook Strait. DNA studies show it forms a super-species with the hoary-headed grebe of Australia<em>. </em>There also appears to be a relationship between this genus and <em>Rollandia </em>of South America<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mainly eats aquatic invertebrates, such as insects and their larvae, which it pecks from the surface or catches from the air. Also eats small freshwater fish and crayfish, shellfish and leeches, which it catches during dives up to 30 seconds long.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3636\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3636</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Grebe\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Grebe</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.; Robertson, H. 1996 (rev 2000). <em>The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand</em>.

The hoary-headed grebe is locally common in Australia and vagrant to New Zealand, where it has bred. It may be mistaken for a young New Zealand dabchick.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A small greyish grebe, paler on the sides, with a stout straight bill, short legs and small wings. In all plumages a broad pale wing stripe is visible in flight, and sometimes when resting. In breeding plumage they develop distinctive whitish (hoary) streaks on the head. In non-breeding plumage a dark cap extending to below the eye contrasts with the pale cheeks and side of neck. From behind, hoary-headed grebes often show a fluffy white downy rear. They are usually silent.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: very similar in size and structure to New Zealand dabchick. In breeding plumage, hoary-headed grebe has a paler, more streaked head, an inconspicuous eye, a small pale tip to the bill, and pale buff neck and breast; New Zealand dabchick has a rufous neck and breast, and a prominent yellow eye. In non-breeding plumage, New Zealand dabchick is more rufous, and does not have the strongly capped appearance. Non-breeding Australasian little grebe also has a contrasting cap, but has a yellow eye, and a prominent pale flange at the base of the bill.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoary-headed grebes are common on lakes throughout Australia. Vagrant to New Zealand, where they have occurred from the Snares Islands in the south to Northland. At least two pairs bred in Southland in the late 1970s.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">First recorded at the Snares Islands in February 1975, then shortly afterwards at Lake Horowhenua in 1975 &amp; 1977, and Lagoon Creek, Southland 1975-76 (breeding). Two pairs bred in Southland in 1977-78. There were many scattered records throughout the South Island through to 1989, especially at Bromley sewage ponds (Christchurch), Lake Elterwater (Marlborough), and Redcliff Wetland Reserve (Southland). The only North Island records were Aupouri Peninsula, Far North (2 birds, 1987) and Tahaunui Stream, Gisborne (1998). After a 14-year gap, one was seen at Big Lagoon, Southland, in May 2012,&#xA0;one at Lake Hakapoua, Fiordland, in February 2013, and three at Lake Elterwater in August 2014.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hoary-headed grebes are gregarious in Australia. They typically avoid the shoreline and prefer deeper water habitats. Totally aquatic except when nesting, hoary-headed grebes are wary, and often fly if disturbed. They swim with head and neck partly immersed followed by shallow dives for prey. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Primarily aquatic arthropods obtained by diving.

They have relatively long necks and a submarine-like ability to change their buoyancy. Australasian little grebe occurs on small lakes and farm ponds. The smallest of four grebe species that occur in New Zealand, it is a recent coloniser from Australia with the first breeding record from Diamond Lake near Wanaka in 1977. Since then it has established a small breeding population centred around Northland and until c.2000 in Canterbury (where it has since died out). It is closely related to the little grebe of Eurasia and Africa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Distinguished in breeding plumage by glossy black head and neck, rufous facial feathering, bright yellow eyes, and small yellow gape-patch at the base of short, black pointed bill. Non-breeding plumage grey-brown above, paler grey-white below and lacks rufous facial markings. Yellow gape-patch fades after breeding. Grey-black legs have large lobed toes. The tail is a short, pointed tuft of dark feathers. Sexes alike; male slightly heavier. Chicks dark brown-black with irregular creamy white striped markings, red-pink eye ring and pinkish-yellow bill with dark brown markings. Juveniles retain striped markings on head and neck until adult plumage develops; bill becomes black with age.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: adults give loud, explosive &apos;laughing&apos; trill and <em>pit </em>alarm call. Chicks make piping call and <em>peep</em> when begging for food.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: larger, darker New Zealand dabchick has more extensive rufous red neck front and breast, and lacks small pale yellow gape-patch behind base of bill.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since first recorded breeding on Lake Diamond near Wanaka in 1977, the Australasian little grebe established small breeding population centred around Northland, the Rotorua Lakes area and Canterbury. There has been a notable increase in range from Northland to Auckland and the Rotorua Lakes area in recent years, but no records from the South Island since 2008. Reduced ground water levels in parts of Canterbury caused some ponds where they bred to dry up. Favours small reed-fringed freshwater lakes, dune lakes and farm ponds rather than large lakes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The global population is an estimated 25,000-1 million. The New Zealand population was estimated at 50 individuals in 1995.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the Australasian little grebe is abundant in Australia, the small colonising population in New Zealand has not been the focus of any conservation effort. Its preference for small water bodies that may be susceptible to drying up means that there are few sites where they are continuously present in New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Egg-laying period in Australia mainly September-November with opportunistic breeding recorded during floods, August-April. Young recorded in New Zealand, January-April. Solitary pairs nest on freshwater lakes, sand dune lakes, and farm ponds, anchoring nest to aquatic vegetation. The nest is a pile of aquatic vegetation up to 60 cm deep. Elaborate courtship involves parallel-swimming, forward or hunched displays on water, and similar displays on the nest platform, accompanied by trilling. Monogamous; 4 bluish eggs laid September-November, staining reddish-brown in the nest. 23 day incubation and 8 week chick-rearing period shared. Chicks ride on parents&apos; backs during first weeks until independence.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Inhabits small shallow freshwater lakes, sand-dune lakes and farm ponds, usually in pairs. May form small flocks outside breeding season. Has submarine-like ability to change its buoyancy, which it does by adjusting the angle at which its dense waterproof feathers are held against its body. This ability allows it to swim high or low in the water and to dive frequently. It can also sink silently beneath the surface when alarmed and use its relatively long neck and head as a &apos;periscope&apos;. It also &apos;snorkels&apos; at the surface with its neck and head submerged in search of prey. Aggressive territorial behaviour directed towards intruders includes an upright attack posture with neck held erect, head feathers ruffled and tail tuft cocked; a forward leaning display posture with head and neck extended low over the water, feathers ruffled and wings folded; and water-kicking, splash-diving and token-diving. Appeasement displays include holding head and bill low in the water with neck held slightly forwards and the rear-end underwater. Swallows small feathers to help form pellets to combat gastric parasites. Mainly flies at night<em>.</em> </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Australia eats mainly small fish, snails and aquatic insects which it catches during dives, as well as vegetation and small frogs. The diet is likely to be similar in New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3629\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3629</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Grebe\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Grebe</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.; Robertson, H. 1996 (rev 2000). <em>The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand</em>.

One or two birds may be found patrolling a rocky shoreline or nearby estuary. Although similar to the common white-faced heron it is not seen as frequently and has slightly different feeding habits. Reef herons occur throughout Polynesia, and their prevalence in northern New Zealand may reflect their preference for warmer climates.</p>\n<p>The dark grey colour provides the bird with excellent camouflage when it is patrolling the shoreline rocks that are its main habitat.

During the breeding season it develops long plumes, mainly on its back but with some also on its chest. It has no white face but a small streak of white may sometimes be seen on the throat. In flight it tucks its head back into its shoulders so that the length of its neck is hidden, giving it a hunched appearance. It stays fairly low unless travelling a significant distance when it may fly higher. Immature birds are brownish.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a harsh croak.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the white-faced heron is paler and two-toned grey, with an obvious white face when adult. It has a more upright stance, and uses a much wider range of habitats than the reef heron, which is never seen away from the coast. In flight, the reef heron is uniformly dark, whereas the white-faced heron&apos;s dark flight feathers contrast with the paler grey wing coverts and body.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reef herons are widely distributed through eastern Asia, the tropical Pacific islands, Australia and New Zealand. Elsewhere there are two colour morphs, white and grey, with birds in intermediate plumage occurring also. Only the grey morph breeds in New Zealand, but there has been a single record of a white bird, at the Avon-Heathcote Estuary, Christchurch, in June 1987. Typical grey birds may be seen in the North, South, Stewart and some offshore islands, with more birds found in northern areas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The reef heron is a bird of the rocky shore, where it stalks around rock pools and small rivulets of water that may carry fish. It can also be seen on estuary mudflats feeding at low tide and may occasionally be seen wading in the shallow waves on sandy beaches. It is rarely seen inland. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand reef heron population is estimated at only 300-500 birds, but they are regularly seen at the sites where they occur, and those populations surveyed appear to have been stable over the past 40 years. They are widespread and abundant elsewhere in their range.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The shoreline habitat occupied by the reef heron has ongoing threats from encroachment by development, and the birds are vulnerable to disturbance by people and dogs. The conservation status of this species was changed from nationally vulnerable to nationally endangered in 2013.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reef herons are usually solitary birds, and they occur at low densities, with territories of adjacent pairs often many kilometres apart. They nest in dark places that are fairly low to the ground, e.g. in rocky caverns and under old bridges, etc. Nesting is usually September to December with the 2-3 eggs incubated by both parents. Hatchlings have dark grey down and are fed partially-regurgitated food from both parents. They start wandering near the nest after about three weeks, and continue to be cared for by the parents for a further two to three weeks. The family group may either break up at this time, or stay together through to at least February.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daily feeding routines are influenced by tide cycles, with birds feeding on the falling or low tide, including at night. Reef herons are usually seen individually but may sometimes be found in small groups, especially when roosting at high tide.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reef herons catch and eat small fish, crustaceans and worms. They move stealthily to catch&#xA0;their prey by surprise, and sometimes crouch with outstretched wings to create a shaded area underneath to entice prey within reach, which is then rapidly stabbed or grabbed. Other foraging techniques include moving carefully along the water&apos;s edge looking for prey, or using a foot to stir up the substrate in order to catch any prey so disturbed.

Elsewhere, it is an infrequent vagrant. As their name suggests, night herons are largely nocturnal, and seldom seen during the day unless disturbed from their roost. The nankeen night heron is closely related to the black&#x2011;crowned night heron, <em>N. nycticorax</em>, of the Americas, Africa, southern Europe, and Central, South and South-east Asia.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Te Atihaunui a P&#x101;p&#x101;rangi <em>iwi </em>at Jerusalem (Hiruh&#x101;rama) consider nankeen night herons to be <em>kaitiaki</em> or caretakers of the remains of one of their <em>tupuna</em>, Hohepa Te Umuroa, who was exiled to Tasmania in 1846. His exile followed an incident in the Hutt Valley in which he was said to have taken part. He died of tuberculosis on Maria Island, Tasmania, the following year and was buried there. In 1988, his remains were repatriated and reburied at Patiarero marae at Hiruh&#x101;rama. Nankeen night herons were first noticed in Jerusalem soon after, and are considered by local people to have carried Te Umuroa&#x2019;s spirit back home.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The species&#x2019; common name, nankeen, refers to the similarity in colour of its underparts to the yellowish-brown cotton found originally around the Chinese city of Nanking, once used to make buff-coloured cotton trousers. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A stocky, short-necked heron usually found skulking inside tree canopies, where the birds roost during the daytime. It has a characteristic hunched appearance when perched, making it look broad-shouldered and large-headed. Adults have a black crown and hind neck, a narrow burnt-orange line above the eye, rufous-brown upperparts and wings, and a short square rufous-brown tail. The underparts cream with burnt-orange cheeks, neck and sides of upper breast, more intensely coloured when breeding. The underwing coverts are beige, and the flight feathers rufous brown. Breeding birds also have two thin white plumes projecting from the crown down towards the back. The bill is black and heavy, about the same length as the head, the top edge curving downwards towards the tip. Bare skin between the eye and bill is pale lime-yellow, and the iris orange, accentuated by a narrow ring of dark feathers around the eye. The legs are creamy yellow; shorter than other herons in New Zealand, the feet just projecting beyond the tail in flight. Sexes similar but the female is slightly smaller. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Juvenile and immature birds are sandy brown, speckled dark brown, reddish brown and off-white above, and streaked brown below, tinged rufous on the cheeks, neck and upper breast. Juveniles have a brown-streaked crown and nape; in contrast, immature birds have a darker, less obviously streaked cap. Wing coverts are dull reddish brown with white edges, aligned so that they look like serrated bars. Flight and tail feathers are chestnut-brown with prominent white tips. The bill is dark grey above grading to olive-yellow below, with a dark grey tip; legs lime-green.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a rasping <em>qu&#x2011;arck </em>given by birds departing the roost at night; females and immature birds higher pitched, <em>qu&#x2011;ook</em>. A short, deep <em>quock</em> given by roosting birds when disturbed. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Australasian bittern is distinctly bigger, heavier, and browner, with broadly streaked underparts and finely&#x2011;barred underwings. Similar-sized cattle egret is much slimmer and paler; other heron species are considerably larger with longer necks, curved in flight, and longer legs that project well beyond the tail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nankeen night herons are resident only along the Whanganui River from around Pipiriki to Whanganui where it was first noted in the early 1990s and subsequently found breeding. Birds have been recorded from various sites there almost every year since. Elsewhere in New Zealand it is rare vagrant, recorded on at least 24 occasions between 1845 and 2013, ranging from the Snares Islands in the south to the Waikato River near Maungatautari and Pakowai, Hawkes Bay, in the north and east. It may have bred at Blenheim in 1958. Three banded birds released from Wellington Zoo in 1982 were subsequently seen separately at Pakawau, Golden Bay (Aug 1983), Waiwhetu Stream, Lower Hutt (Jan 1984), and Warkworth (1984). There is no evidence that these birds or those released near Wellington in 1852 became established or bred.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nankeen night herons occur along rivers and streams, roosting during daytime in dense cover of both native and introduced evergreen trees. Roosts are known from Jerusalem, Kauarapaoa Rd and Kemp&#x2019;s Pole (Whanganui River near Kaiwhaiki), and Upokongaro. These roosts are situated away from the Whanganui River itself, being inside settlements, close to human habitation (Jerusalem, Upokongaro), or along a stream and in nearby forest (Kauarapaoa Rd and Kemp&#x2019;s Pole). Numbers at the Kemp&#x2019;s Pole roost vary from 2-18, &#xA0;not following any clear pattern through the year.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Whanganui River population is estimated at about 50 birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Adults may be vulnerable to disturbance when breeding, and to predators when feeding, but are generally wary. Eggs and young chicks are likely to be susceptible to predation, but this has not been studied. No conservation measures are in place.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The only confirmed nest in New Zealand held three unequal&#x2011;sized chicks when found near Jerusalem in early November 1995. Three other apparently empty nests were found nearby. The nest was a platform of loose sticks situated in a tree fern in regenerating native bush on a steep slope above a stream, 600 m from its confluence with the Whanganui River. Sightings of&#xA0;recently fledged juveniles in February-March suggest egg-laying in spring. No other details known.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little known. Almost completely nocturnal, most birds leaving their daytime roosts 23-36 minutes after sunset, when it is almost dark. Foraging areas are likely to be along edges of rivers and streams. Roosting birds are wary and secretive, but not necessarily shy, occasionally creeping out to get a better look at an observer, or sunning themselves on the edge of roost trees. In Australia, juveniles disperse widely after fledging, which may account for the high frequency of young birds among those recorded in New Zealand. In the southern part of their range in Australia, adult birds are partly migratory, moving northwards in winter, as well as moving in response to major rainfall and flooding events. Some may end up in New Zealand, as they do on other western and southwest Pacific islands. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Poorly known in New Zealand. Droppings of a bird at Tarara, Otago, contained the remains of freshwater crayfish. In Australia, they are known to take fish, frogs, freshwater invertebrates and hatchling sea turtles, among other things.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bell, B.D. 1958.

This is due to their secretive behaviour, inconspicuous plumage and the inaccessibility of their habitat. Their presence is most commonly discerned through hearing the distinctive &#x2018;booming&#x2019; call of the males during the breeding season. Bittern occasionally show themselves in the open along wetland edges, dykes, drains, flooded paddocks or roadsides, often adopting their infamous &#x2018;freeze&#x2019; stance, with the bill pointing skyward, even when caught out in the open. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bitterns are large, stocky birds, with streaky dark-brown and beige plumage on their throat, breast, belly and thighs, with dark brown on the neck and back. The head is dark except for pale beige around the cheek, forming either a pale eyebrow or eye-stripe. Plumage varies greatly but this does not appear to be related to region, season or sex. Some variation is explainable by age, with juveniles possessing a &#x2018;buffy&#x2019; mottled pattern on the primary feathers and yellow irises. Feather and iris colour gradually darkens from the shaft/pupil outwards as the bird matures, with adults possessing uniform copper-red irises and dark-brown (unpatterned) primaries. Birds may&#xA0;attain adult plumage by their third year, however, only a few birds of known-age have been followed to date making it difficult to confirm how quickly and consistently this transition in appearance occurs. Plumage of very old birds is thought to re-lighten but with white on the feathers rather than a buffy mottling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: male bitterns produce a sequence of distinctive &#x2018;<em>wooom</em>&#x2019; calls known as &#x2018;booms&#x2019;. Each call sequence consists of several individual booms, ranging from 1-10 booms per sequence, with a mean of 3. These sequences are repeated at regular intervals that appear consistent to individual birds. The calls are assumed to be related to breeding as their production is almost entirely limited to the breeding season. Booms are commonly preceded or interceded with gasps or inhalations. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Females are largely silent, apart from producing a bubbling noise when they return to the nest, and a nasal &#x2018;<em>kau</em>&#x2019; when alarmed. Birds in flight may produce a resonant or nasal &#x2018;<em>kau</em>&#x2019; or &#x2018;<em>kau kau</em>&#x2019;.  Chicks produce a bubbling &#x2018;see see&#x2019; call on the nest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Found throughout New Zealand, as well as parts of Australia and New Caledonia. A radio-tracking study on 10 adult male bitterns in the Hawke&apos;s Bay showed that birds utilised a network of wetlands, within a 15 km radius, seasonally. Sites regularly visited included raup&#x14D;-fringed lakes, spring-fed creeks with cover and areas of rank-grass along paddock/drain edges. Studies at Whangamarino wetland, show bitterns mostly inhabit mineralised and semi-mineralised wetlands, although they also foraged in drains and wetland/farmland edges. Birds can travel long distances. Radio-tracking studies in Australia have shown that bitterns can move over 550 km within a very short space of time (11 days). However, radio-tracking studies in New Zealand suggest bitterns have smaller home ranges and make fewer long trips, than their Australian counterparts. The furthest a New Zealand bittern has travelled to date (2017) was 140 km (a juvenile female in the Canterbury region).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Estimates for the New Zealand population were as low as 900 individuals in the 1980s. Subsequent data suggests steep population declines at at least one former stronghold. Whangamarino wetland was thought to have as many as 145 bitterns in the 1980s, but more recent reports suggest &lt; 15 males currently attempt to breed at the site now (suggesting an 89% decline over 35 years or 7% decline per annum). National population estimates for Australia are similarly low (fewer than 1000 birds), with declines of &gt; 90 % being reported. New Caledonia has fewer than 50 birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bittern numbers in New Zealand declined greatly following destruction of 90% of their wetland habitat to create farmland and towns. Ongoing habitat loss is still considered one of their greatest threats, although predators, poor water quality, and reduced food availability may have contributed to population declines. Recent radio-tracking studies have suggested that winter starvation many be contributing to population declines. Nest success, and chick/female survival is also suspected to be particularly low.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Few bittern nests have been found or studied. The nest is a platform of reeds built by the female among dense wetland vegetation, usually 20-30 cm above the water. The 3-5 eggs are laid between &#xA0;August and December (peaking in November), and are incubated by the female alone for about 25 days till hatch. Chicks remain in the nest for about 7 weeks. Nestlings are usually reported between September and February, and fledge from November to May.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bitterns are extremely sensitive to disturbance. When approached they either try to steal away silently before they have been detected, or adopt a still posture, commonly known as the &#x2018;freeze&#x2019; or &#x2018;surveillance&#x2019; pose. This stance involves standing with an erect neck and bill. It allows the bird to blend perfectly into most wetland environments, whilst maintaining good surveillance of its surroundings. If an observer continues to approach a bittern that is in freeze stance, the bird will eventually take flight laboriously, or occasionally will flatten its chest completely to the ground, using its superbly camouflaged plumage to blend into the background.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Foraging bitterns often stalk along wetland or water edges slowly, taking prey opportunistically. In areas where prey are abundant they have been observed slowly moving towards prey items until they are close enough to take their prey in a discreet, steady manner without needing to lunge or swipe. A bird&#x2019;s ability to see and stab their prey is suspected to be important for bittern foraging and survival. This is a concern in New Zealand, as water quality and depths vary considerably, and are often artificially maintained as part of flood schemes, making bittern prey difficult to access seasonally at some sites. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australasian bitterns feed mainly on fish, including eels, but they also take spiders, insects, molluscs, worms, freshwater crayfish, frogs and lizards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Web links </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Bittern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Bittern</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/australasian-bittern-matuku/facts/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/australasian-bittern-matuku/facts/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/wetlands/arawai-kakariki-wetland-restoration-programme/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/wetlands/arawai-kakariki-wetland-restoration-programme/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/page-3\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/page-3</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/matuku.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/matuku.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=Australasian_Bittern\">http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=Australasian_Bittern</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3767\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3767</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106003767/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106003767/0</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">BirdLife International. 2012.

Vagrants may occur more frequently than the single sighting suggests, but would most likely be overlooked.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little bitterns are small herons standing about 20 cm tall. Adult males are distinctive with a black cap, back and tail and yellowish-buff brown plumage on the neck, under parts and patches on the wings. The bill is yellowish-brown and leg colour is variable from greenish to yellow. In contrast, the female is smaller and darker; its neck, back and wings are rufous-brown, its wing patches a paler rufous and its black crest less developed than the male.

Like several of our poorly known species it had an identity crisis, with some ornithologists suggesting that it was similar or identical to the Australian little bittern. It is now recognised as having been a distinct species.</p>\n<p>Most of the New Zealand little bitterns were collected on the West Coast, apart from a very early record from Tauranga and a specimen collected at the head of Lake Wakatipu. A few fossil bones are also known. It was never a common bird in European experience and was said to &#x201C;hate civilisation.&#x201D; The last definite records were from the mid 1890s.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The crown and nape of adult male New Zealand little bitterns were bluish black, and the throat buff, merging to rich chestnut on the hind neck. Brownish spotting on the foreneck formed an irregular reddish brown streak along the centre. The face was buffy chestnut, with a rich chestnut streak over the eye and a less distinct browner patch from the gape below the eye finishing below the ear. The upper back was black with reddish brown streaks at the base of the neck becoming browner towards the tail. The tail was black and the flight feathers dark brown. The upper wing surfaces were chestnut from the wing joint and blackish brown streaked with buffy brown closer to the body. The under sides were buffy white with blackish spots, larger and almost forming irregular stripes on the sides of the breast. The bill was dark brown with the lower edge yellowish green. Bare skin between the bill and the eyes was yellowish green, the eye golden yellow and the legs green. Female New Zealand little bitterns appear to have had similar plumage to males, which is unusual in small bitterns. Young birds were browner below and blacker on the back, while the upper wing was entirely rich tawny buff. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: wild birds were not known to call but Buller noted that a captive bird showing alarm at a cat gave &#x201C;a peculiar snapping cry&#x201D; and &#x201C;when molested it uttered a cry not unlike that of a kingfisher, but not so loud.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">New Zealand little bitterns were probably once widespread in New Zealand. Subfossil bones have been found widely in the North and South Islands and also on Chatham Island. Almost all birds collected in the 1800s came from the West Coast. Here, William Docherty recorded that &#x201C;They are to be found on the salt-water lagoons on the sea shore, always hugging the timbered side. &#x2026; I caught one about two miles in the bush on the bank of a creek, but the creek lead to a lagoon.&#x201D; Two were taken near a deep, slow flowing fresh water stream near Kaniere.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The early scarcity of New Zealand little bitterns may have been due to the early spread of Norway rats and feral cats throughout New Zealand. A captive bird showed alarm at the presence of a cat. Their final demise seems to coincide well with the first wave of the stoat invasion on the West Coast and was before the wetlands were drained for farming.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It was said to nest on the ground but it is unclear if this was a guess or whether a nest was actually seen. An egg taken from inside a dead bird was said to be large.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Docherty noted that &#x201C;I have seen them in two positions, standing on the banks of the lagoon with their heads bent forward, studiously watching the water and standing straight up, almost perpendicular; I should say this is the proper position for the bird to be placed in when stuffed. &#x2026; They are always found alone and stand for hours in one place.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Birds in captivity ate mudfish and worms, but would only take food served in water.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Buller, W.L. 1888. <em>A history of the birds of New Zealand</em>.

A few reach New Zealand most years, where they are mainly seen in wetlands, estuaries and damp pasture. Although usually seen singly, pairs and flocks of up to 24 birds are also occasionally seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The glossy ibis is a heron-sized bird with a strongly down-curved bill, reddish-brown body plumage, and shiny bottle-green wings. Immature individuals have more muted brown plumage. The long curved bill is dark brown. In breeding condition, the adults have cobalt-blue facial skin patches. The face mask is blue-grey in non-breeding individuals.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: breeding birds emit croaks and grunts, including a hoarse &#x201C;<em>grrrr&#x201D;.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: straw-necked ibis has white underparts and (as adult) straw-like neck plumes. Eastern curlew is of similar size and bill shape, but is mottled brown.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The glossy ibis is widely distributed throughout most warm temperate and tropical regions of the world. It is common throughout much of southern Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Atlantic and Caribbean region of the Americas. Its preferred habitat is areas of shallow freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation such as reeds, papyrus or rushes, and low trees or bushes. They also occur in coastal areas and open grassland. Most glossy ibises in New Zealand have been seen in damp rough pasture, the margins of freshwater lakes, and in estuaries. They may form large flocks and congregate in communal roost sites. Currently, it is not listed as threatened by the IUCN but there are alerts to the threats of wetland habitat degradation and loss through drainage, irrigation and invasion by exotic plants.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The glossy ibis is a frequent vagrant to New Zealand. There have been at least 50 records, mostly of single birds, since the first sighting at Washdyke Lagoon (Timaru) in 1902. Small flocks arrived in 1953 (three flocks of 14, 18 &amp; 24 birds), 1968 (3), 1975 (4) and 1988 (6 &amp; 7). In recent years there has been a bird present every winter at Travis Wetland and nearby Bexley Wetlands, Christchurch (1999-2014), and 1-2 birds have been seen regularly at Unahi (Northland), Ohiwa (Bay of Plenty), and Manawatu Estuary,&#xA0;with up to&#xA0;5 at&#xA0;Wairau Lagoons (Blenheim). There are two records from Stewart Islands, and one reached Chatham Island in December 1984. The first reported breeding in New Zealand was a pair on a nest at Wainono Lagoon, South Canterbury, in January 2015. Three young fledged from a second site (Wairau Lagoons, Blenheim) in December 2015.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The&#xA0;first&#xA0;New Zealand breeding record was a single pair among a royal spoonbill colony.&#xA0;Elsewhere it is a communal breeder, and also congregates in migrating flocks outside the breeding season. The glossy ibis rarely calls, but when breeding it emits croaks and grunts, including a hoarse &#x201C;<em>grrrr&#x201D;</em>. It is an active predator that hunts with a probing action of its long downward-curved bill. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Prey items depend on the season and location, and include a variety of invertebrates, and occasionally fish, amphibians, lizards, small snakes and nestling birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3777\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3777</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossy_Ibis\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossy_Ibis</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Child, P. 1969.

Shortly after, several more white ibises were reported from scattered locations throughout the country, suggesting that a flock had crossed the Tasman Sea. Similar influxes have occurred in 1957-8 and 1977-8.

They are plump and mainly white with a thick, long, black down-curved bill and a black (adult) or blackish (immature) head and neck. The tips of the wings are also black, and show at rest. The legs are long and black. In flight the neck is outstretched, the wings are broad and blunt-ended and the tail short with the legs trailing behind. The wings beat a little faster than a heron&#x2019;s. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: white ibis is most&#xA0;similar to a royal spoonbill in flight but lacks the long spoon-shaped bill. With its large down-curved bill, the white ibis could only be confused with the related straw-necked ibis and glossy ibis, or the eastern curlew, all of which differ greatly in overall coloration.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White ibises are widespread in Australia, but are especially common in the south-east. They inhabit shallow freshwater wetlands, estuaries and grasslands including man-made habitats even in urban areas. Adults are typically sedentary in south-eastern Australia, but partial migrants in the south-west. Immature and adult white ibises living in seasonally and irregularly fluctuating wetlands move widely, especially during dry spells, and this appears to have driven the invasions of New Zealand in the 1950s and 1970s.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Records of white ibises in New Zealand show three discrete invasions and several scattered records after 1980. Dated records for the two later invasions can be interpreted as particular individuals settling and making relatively local movements only. During the first influx in 1925, white ibises were seen in Appleby (Nelson), Riwaka, Rotomanu (Westland) and south Taranaki. About 11 immature birds were present during the second influx in the winter of 1957. They were recorded from Te Kopuru, Port Albert (Kaipara Harbour), Lake Orawheiti (Pakaraka), Kawhia, Ngaroto Lake (Te Awamutu), Rangitikei River mouth (4 birds), Westport (one bird present until October 1960), Arahura (Westland, 2 birds), Hokitika (probably the same 2 birds), Doubtful Sound, Papatotara near Tuatapere (one shot), and various locations from Otautau to Invercargill (one bird staying to June 1958). A third influx of about six single birds occurred in 1975, with some birds persisting until 1979. Sightings included Awanui (Northland), Waima, near Huntly, Maketu and other Bay of Plenty estuaries and lagoons, Manawatu Estuary and Foxton, and Shag River estuary (North Otago). White ibises have subsequently been seen at Oamaru in 1984, Orowaiti (Westland) in January 1986 and Helensville in January 1989. There was an unverified record from Okuru, Westland in April 2006.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The European settlement of Australia has benefitted white ibises, and their range has expanded as farmland has been cleared and areas irrigated. They also utilise urban habitats, feeding on lawns and scavenging waste.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White ibises occur alone and in flocks. They roost in trees, often with other species of ibises, spoonbills or herons, and breed colonially. When feeding they walk and wade slowly, probing for food.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White ibises catch and eat small, usually aquatic, animals from fish and frogs to insects, shellfish, crabs and crayfish.

During the breeding season, adults grow distinctive long white crest feathers on the back of the head or nape, up to 20 cm long in males. The crest is raised during mating displays revealing pink skin beneath. The bill is 136 - 220 mm long; the wingspan is circa 120 cm. Breeding birds have a creamy-yellow breast, a yellow patch above each&#xA0;eye, and a red patch in the middle of the forehead in front of the crest feathers. Females are slightly smaller than males, with shorter legs and bill. Outside the breeding season the crest feathers are smaller and the rest of the plumage often appears soiled. Juveniles resemble non-breeding adults but are slightly smaller with a shorter bill, dark tips to the main flight feathers, and lack a crest and coloured face patches. When wading in shallow water it often submerges the bill and repeatedly sweeps it in a wide arc in search of prey.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: grunts, groans and hisses with <em>chew </em>and <em>cho </em>calls made at the nest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: there are two records of the similar yellow-billed spoonbill in New Zealand, which is slightly larger and heavier, with a pale yellowish bill and legs. The white heron is taller and thinner with a slender, pointed, bright yellow bill (note that bill is mainly black&#xA0;just before and during&#xA0;breeding).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Breeds in Australia and New Zealand. Straggles to Indonesia, New Guinea and some Pacific islands. In New Zealand, breeds in coastal colonies around North and South Islands, and disperses widely around the country after breeding. Single records from the Chatham and Kermadec Islands. Breeds in the exposed canopy of tall kahikatea trees, on the ground near estuaries, rivers and harbours, in reeds, in low shrubs, and on steep rocky headlands at Taiaroa Head and Nugget Point. Tends to breed near white heron and shag colonies. After breeding, birds disperse to estuaries and wetlands around the country. Prefers freshwater to saltwater but can inhabit both. In New Zealand, most birds inhabit estuaries.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1977 the New Zealand population was estimated at 52 birds. The most recent estimate (in 2012) was 2360 birds. A colony and nest count during the 2013-14 breeding season found 19 colonies with at least 614 nests.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Royal spoonbills are sensitive to disturbance during the breeding season, and are vulnerable to development and recreational activities. The IUCN Red List classifies it as Least Concern. Department of Conservation classifies it as naturally uncommon but increasing with a restricted range and secure overseas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Colonial and semi-colonial annual breeder. Breeding birds gather at nesting sites in October. Mixed groups of unpaired birds gather to form &quot;bachelor parties&quot; and begin displaying, often in trees near the breeding colony. Males spar more often than females, extending their necks, bill gaping, and jabbing and wing flapping. Courtship involves circular or figure-of-eight flight displays over the breeding area with exaggerated flight noise. Both sexes bow while clapping bills and quivering heads, raising and lowering crest plumes. Mutual preening follows once the pair bond is established. Greeting display involves repeatedly nodding with open bill, 45&#xB0; above and below horizontal, and crest fanned. Nests in colonies alongside water, usually with other waterbirds. The bowl-shaped nest of sticks is lined with leaves and other vegetation, and usually placed in the crown of a tree over water or among tall reeds. Nest sites may be reused in consecutive years. Monogamous during breeding season; 2-4 dull white eggs with brown blotches laid November-February. Both adults share incubation of 20-25 days, and feeding of young by partial regurgitation. Chicks fledge after seven weeks. Juveniles are fed by both adults for several weeks after fledging. Young birds forage alongside parental adults for some time before family group disperses to traditional wintering site.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Feeds while wading in water, repeatedly scything the submerged spoon-shaped bill left and right in an arc. Feeds day or night, whenever tide is suitable. Eats mainly fish in freshwater, and shrimps in tidal flats; also eats other crustaceans, aquatic insects and frogs. Bill structure limits it to feeding in water less than 40 cm deep over sand, mud or clay. Also drags, probes and grabs with bill. Vibration detectors inside the bill can detect prey in murky water or darkness. When prey is detected the bird snaps the bill shut and lifts it to let prey slide down its throat. Feeds and roosts in flocks. Birds fly in lines or &quot;V&quot; formation. Resting birds often stand on one leg in hunched posture with the head resting over shoulder on back with eye still visible and bill tucked under feathers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fish, including flounders, shrimps and other crustaceans, aquatic insects, and frogs.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spoonbill\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spoonbill</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3803\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3803</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D; Robertson, H.A. 2000. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The temporary nature of many of Australia&#x2019;s inland wetlands and the potential mobility of these birds suggest that they should arrive in New Zealand more often. So far two only are known to have come across the Tasman Sea, whereas the very similar royal spoonbill arrived more frequently, established a breeding population and is becoming more common year by year.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The yellow-billed spoonbill is a&#xA0;large white bird with long legs and a long bill, flattened at the end. The yellow-billed spoonbill differs from the much more common royal spoonbill in having the legs and bill pale yellow instead of black, and the plumage is cream coloured rather than pure white. They fly with the neck outstretched like other ibises and spoonbills, but the lack of any black and the prominent yellow bill are distinctive. The typical flight pattern consists of periods of wing beats followed by glides but they can soar up to high altitudes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: Usually quiet but may give a loud call described as a coughing-hiss.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: royal spoonbill has a&#xA0;black bill and legs.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yellow-billed spoonbills are widespread in Australia, mainly in the eastern and northern parts of the continent. They are absent from Tasmania. Their&#xA0;movement patterns are not well known, possibly seasonal in the north but not in the south. Vagrants to Lord Howe and Norfolk Island and New Zealand occurred during or after periods of high rainfall in inland Australia. They mainly utilise temporary or permanent freshwater wetlands, and are much less frequently found in estuaries or harbours. They feed in shallow, open water and may use very small water bodies.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Two records: Rangaunu Bay, Northland (August 1976 to 1981), and Te Whiti, Wairarapa (December 1981).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Australia the range of yellow-billed spoonbills has increased since European settlement as they use farm dams and channels. However, they are intolerant of disturbance, and many natural wetlands used for feeding and nesting have been degraded by draining, clearing, or increased salinity. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yellow-billed spoonbills may be solitary or gather in small flocks. The bird at&#xA0;Rangaunu Bay&#xA0;kept company with two royal spoonbills and a white ibis. Feeding is tactile, sweeping the bill from side to side, walking steadily through the water but occasionally running to catch prey.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yellow-billed spoonbills mainly eat aquatic insects, with smaller numbers of freshwater crayfish, shrimps and fish.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed_Spoonbill\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed_Spoonbill</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Billing, A.E. 1977.

They do not migrate, but range further away from the breeding islands after the season is over. Although one of the smallest seabirds known from the New Zealand region, they thrive in the often wild seas of the roaring forties, the furious fifties and even reaching the screaming sixties.</p>\n<p>There is a long history of grey-backed storm petrels being attracted to lights in Fiordland and South Westland, including recently fledged young with down adhering. The provenance of these birds is unknown, but there has been speculation that there may be a breeding colony somewhere inaccessible to predators in a remote area of Fiordland.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-backed storm petrels are dark-grey on the head, breast and neck, slightly paler grey on the back and ashy grey on the rump. The flight and tail feathers are black. The belly and under the wings are white excepting a black leading edge to the wing. They are compactly built, with short tails and legs, with the feet barely reaching past the tip of the tail. In flight they flutter more and&#xA0;use&#xA0;their legs less than other storm petrels, but at times do run off the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>Voice: a monotonous wheezy, cricket-like chirp with two syllables is given by birds on the ground at the breeding colonies.</p>\n<p>Similar species: In harsh light, grey-backed storm petrels can look very dark, but they never have the white rump that the black-and-white storm petrels do. White-faced storm petrels also have grey backs, but they are larger with longer legs and have a characteristic bounding flight.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-backed storm petrels breed on many islands around the southern ocean. In the New Zealand region there are breeding colonies on the Chatham, Antipodes, Campbell and Auckland Islands. They burrow under mats of vegetation and into the bases of tussocks to nest.</p>\n<p>At sea, they forage over deep water near the shelf edge and beyond in subantarctic waters as far north as the subtropical convergence, dispersing further away from the breeding islands after the season has ended. Some birds regularly feed in southern New Zealand waters, and in winter they may occur anywhere around the coast, occasionally in substantial numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The breeding population of grey-backed storm petrels in New Zealand probably runs into the tens of thousands of pairs, including 10,000 to 12,000 birds on the Chatham Islands, and tens of thousands of pairs on the Antipodes Islands. On Campbell and the Auckland Islands, grey-backed storm petrels are restricted to offshore islands by predators (since eradicated on Campbell Island). The Campbell Island population is probably small but the Auckland Island population may be substantial.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-backed storm petrels are small and vulnerable on land. They are harvested at their breeding colonies by subantarctic skuas, and on the Antipodes Islands some breeding adults may be killed and eaten by Antipodes Island parakeets. Nests, eggs and chicks may be inadvertently damaged by larger petrels and penguins especially when seeking nest sites.</p>\n<p>Grey-backed storm petrels have gone completely from islands with rats and cats but survive on the Antipodes Islands in the presence of mice. As the storm petrels are dependent on vegetation for nesting, fire and large herbivorous mammals could destroy breeding habitat rapidly.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-backed storm petrels breed as pairs, and share parental duties. Nest sites are tunnels under dense low vegetation such as mat plants, tussocks and flax. A few nests with two eggs seen on the Chatham Islands were probably due to two females laying in the same nest, as a single egg is&#xA0;normal for all petrels. Incubation is poorly synchronised and the egg may be left untended for several days, but may still hatch after up to three days without incubation.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-backed storm petrels are usually solitary but may be seen in small groups. They nest in colonies.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of the grey-backed storm petrel consists mainly of barnacle larvae but with a variety of other small crustaceans and fish. They are often seen hovering over floating kelp at sea and this may be where they catch the barnacle larvae.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey-backed_Storm_Petrel\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey-backed_Storm_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30170\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30170</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bell, B.D. 1961.

When feeding they move in bounding hops with little wing action and hover in place, paddling to pick up food.</p>\n<p>They breed in colonies on small islands scattered irregularly around the New Zealand coast, returning for parental duties at night. Their small size makes them extremely vulnerable on land and they are only able to breed on islands that are totally free of exotic predators.</p>\n<p>They are only found in the seas around New Zealand for the duration of the breeding season (August to April) migrating to the tropical eastern Pacific for the off season.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>White-faced storm petrels are a little smaller than a blackbird, and are lightly built. They are grey above with darker grey wing tips and tail and underneath they are mainly white. Seen closer they have a white face with a broad dark-grey stripe through the eye, not reaching the bill and their legs are black with yellow webs on the feet. Their wings are fairly broad and their legs very long and often dangling.&#xA0;Movements of white-faced storm petrels over the water are usually highly distinctive, travelling in a series of hops striking the water with both legs held stiffly together and bounding in high little arcs over the water with the wings spread or raised. They are also capable of level flight with head down, a steady wing beat and feet extending well behind the tail.</p>\n<p>Voice: White-faced storm petrels are silent at sea, but birds on the ground make cooing calls at the breeding colonies.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the grey-backed storm petrel is the only other storm petrel in the New Zealand region that is grey dorsally without a white rump. The grey-backed storm petrel is even smaller and is dark grey from the breast to the chin and on the face, where the white-faced storm petrel is white. It doesn&#x2019;t bounce over the water but flutters more with its wings, reminiscent of a passerine, and often runs, rather than bounds, over the surface of the water. The Kermadec storm petrel is closely related to the white-faced storm petrel, and is the same size, shape and colour, but with a white rump of variable extent.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>White-faced storm petrels are pelagic birds usually found near the edge of the continental shelf and over upwellings in the very deep water beyond. In New Zealand they are tied to their breeding colonies and often seen much closer to shore. After breeding they migrate to the eastern tropical Pacific and have been recorded from the vicinity of the Galapagos to the seas offshore from Ecuador.</p>\n<p>One of the very few winter records was identified as being a bird of the Australian subspecies <em>P.m. dulciae</em> (dead on Muriwai Beach, Auckland, May 1983).</p>\n<p>White-faced storm petrels breed in burrows and under dense vegetation on many small offshore islands all around the New Zealand coast, and on the Chatham and Auckland Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The white-faced storm petrel is a fairly common bird at sea, especially near the larger breeding concentrations off the Chatham Islands and north-eastern North Island. At least a million breeding pairs breed in the New Zealand region. The largest colony, on Rangatira Island (Chatham Islands) was estimated at 840,000 pairs, with 10,000 pairs on Hongiora Island, Alderman Islands. Most other colonies around the mainland probably have between a few hundred and a few thousand breeding pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>White-faced storm petrels are small and extremely vulnerable to exotic predators on land, even mice, and so they breed only on predator-free islands. Their ability to expand into new habitats was shown by the rapid recolonisation of Burgess Island, Mokohinau Islands, from other islands in the group, following rat eradication.</p>\n<p>White-faced storm petrels burrow into shallow soil, mainly on the flat tops of islands. Where they burrow in deeper soil (e.g. Rangatira Island), many burrows are taken over and enlarged by larger petrel species, e.g. broad-billed prions and common diving petrels. White-faced storm petrels also nest in or under dense mats of vegetation such as iceplant, <em>Muehlenbeckia</em> vine and rushes.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>White-faced storm petrels breed as monogamous pairs, often in dense colonies. A single egg is laid per season (October to December) and both parents share incubation and chick care. Eggs may be left untended at times, but the egg is resistant to chilling, and hatching has been recorded after a 92-hour abandonment. Incubation takes about 50 days, and the chick fledges when 52-62 days old, with most chicks fledging in March or early April.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>White-faced storm petrels are often solitary at sea, but small flocks form over good patches of food which they seem to locate from some distance by an acute sense of smell.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>White-faced storm petrels mainly eat planktonic crustaceans and some small fish, picked up from the surface of the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-faced_Storm_Petrel\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-faced_Storm_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3972\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3972</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

In November 1925, 15 birds were shot at sea around the islands and from these the species was recognised as distinct and named. They were not recorded again until the 1960s and seen more frequently during the 1980s. Most of these records are close the Kermadec Islands but a group of 4 was seen 480 km off the Australian coast.</p>\n<p>The inability to locate the breeding site led to the suggestion that they might be unusual Australian white-faced storm petrels rather than a distinct form, but the discovery of a colony of these distinctive birds has settled&#xA0;these doubts.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Kermadec storm petrels look like and fly like a white-faced storm petrel, differing only in their rump colour. They are grey above with dark-grey flight feathers and tail; the under-surfaces are white, and there is a broad white stripe above the eye. The bill and legs are black with yellow webs on the feet. Their main distinguishing mark is a prominent white, rather than grey, rump, a nearly square cut rather than forked tail when folded,&#xA0; and there a little less grey on the sides of the breast. When feeding they move with the same high bounding hops as the white-faced storm petrel.</p>\n<p>Voice: unknown</p>\n<p>Similar species: the most distinctive field mark on Kermadec storm petrels, is the contrasting white rump, which the other &#x2018;grey-backed&#x2019; storm petrels do not share. The white breast and front, and the bounding flight pattern further distinguish it from all other storm petrels except the white-faced storm petrel.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Kermadec storm petrels are known to breed only on Haszard Island, offshore from Macauley Island, in the southern Kermadec Islands. Here, they burrow in friable soil under herbs and sedges.</p>\n<p>At sea, Kermadec storm petrels are seen most often close to the island group, with other records up to 750 km from their breeding islands toward the Tasman Sea and New Zealand. There is also a single record off the Australian coast 2,500 km away. All records fall between May and November, and so it is likely that the birds migrate away from the Kermadec Islands for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps 100-300 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the larger islands in the Kermadec group have had rats, cats and pigs, and these predators are the likely reasons why Kermadec storm petrels are now restricted to a small colony on an inaccessible rock. With the removal of all of these animals by the Department of Conservation it is hoped that Kermadec storm petrels can recolonise former breeding sites and numbers will increase again. At present their main threat seems likely to be the disturbance of nests and nesting birds by the larger and vastly more numerous black-winged petrels, little shearwaters and wedge-tailed shearwaters when they dig their nesting burrows.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Kermadec storm petrels are likely to breed as monogamous pairs in colonies. Their single egg is laid in August in a burrow in gritty soil.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the records of Kermadec storm petrels at sea are close to seamount chains in deep water, and so they are probably highly pelagic birds favouring areas of upwelling like other storm petrels. In general their habits are likely to be similar to those of the closely related white-faced storm petrel.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Unknown</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gaskin, C.P. 2011.

A small bird, it has created quite a storm, flying in from extinction in January 2003 when one was sighted by a group of birdwatchers in waters off Whitianga (eastern Coromandel). Luckily, photographs were taken of the bird. Initially thought to be a black-bellied storm petrel, it was later correctly identified to be the New Zealand storm petrel, known only from three specimens collected in the nineteenth century (two in 1827 and one before 1895). Since its rediscovery in 2003, annual surveys have confirmed its presence within northern New Zealand waters, identifying a core region of activity during the New Zealand summer in and around the outer Hauraki Gulf. The first in-the-hand examination of a New Zealand storm petrel came on the night of 4 November 2005 when a bird flew onto a fisherman&#x2019;s boat near Little Barrier Island. By coincidence this fisherman was an ex-conservation officer who recognised the bird as &#x201C;something special&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Subsequently a four-year capture program was undertaken 2005-2009, capturing a further 11 New Zealand storm petrels. Genetic analysis of these birds confirmed them as being the same as the original museum specimens.&#xA0;Tantalising evidence for the local breeding of the New Zealand storm petrel was acquired in January 2011 with a &#x2018;freakish&#x2019; observation of a plant stalk attached to a New Zealand storm petrel&#x2019;s leg. This observation strongly indicated the bird had been ashore for breeding and identification of the stalk to a plant found naturally only in northern New Zealand supported local breeding. In 2012 an intensive at-sea capture program succeeded in capturing 20 New Zealand storm petrels at sea, from early February to late May. Tellingly most showed signs of breeding with bare &#x201C;brood patches&#x201D; on their bellies (used to incubate eggs). Moreover, by catching birds across a four month window regrowth of feathers over the brood patches of birds has been observed, and the timing for the stages of breeding, i.e. incubation and chick rearing, could be determined. This was confirmed in February 2013, when birds were successfully tracked to breeding burrows in the forested interior of Little Barrier Island, and the first nests and chicks of the New Zealand storm petrel were found.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand storm petrel is a small storm-petrel, mostly dark blackish-brown on the head, breast and upperparts, with a sharply defined white rump. The white belly and vent have highly variable dark streaking along the flanks and extending across the belly, the streaks are more scattered and less distinct in the central belly area. There is an indistinct, paler wing bar on inner upperwing. Mostly-white coverts create a white central panel on the underwing, with a broad dark leading edge. The bill, legs and feet are all black; the feet extend beyond the tail in flight. In most wind conditions, flight is direct, with swallow-like rapid changes in direction. Birds also stall and stop over sea surface, lowering feet to momentarily dabble.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Wilson&#x2019;s storm petrel is similar in size, however it lacks the white underparts including the white underwing panel, making the two species fairly easy to separate in the field. Also, when seen feeding together, wings of Wilson&#x2019;s storm petrel are more rounded and flight behaviour more &#x2018;fluttery&#x2019; and butterfly-like. Black-bellied storm petrel is larger (53 g cf 35 g) and has different, bulkier proportions; its feet extend beyond the tail, but not as much as with New Zealand storm petrel. The dark markings on the central belly of black-bellied storm petrels typically create a solid dark line, cf. streaking in New Zealand storm petrel. White-bellied storm petrels from the South-west Pacific region are larger with different, bulkier proportions; their feet do not extend beyond the tail, and they have a shortened, almost cut-off appearance. Dark polymorphic forms (breeding on Lord Howe Island) could be confused with New Zealand storm petrel if not seen well, particularly heavily streaked birds of the latter. White-bellied Storm-petrels can exhibit streaking along the flanks; however the more robust-size and lack of foot extension should separate these two. Grey-backed storm petrel lacks the sharp white rump, and has relatively short, rounded wings. However, in some lights, its clean white underparts, including central panel to underwing, could induce confusion with New Zealand storm petrel. &#x2018;New Caledonian storm petrel&#x2019; (as yet undescribed) has been observed off Noumea Lagoon and the east coast of Australia; while similar to New Zealand storm petrel, it is larger in size (it has been seen alongside&#xA0;three other&#xA0;storm petrel species for size comparison).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand storm petrels breed under tall forest in the interior on Little Barrier Island. At sea, they are known predominantly from sightings and captures from northern New Zealand waters. Sightings of birds in moult off Australia (Queensland,&#xA0;New South Wales and Victoria) suggest post-breeding movement across the Tasman and north to the Coral Sea. Sightings off New Caledonia may prove to be a similar or related, larger taxon.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>No accurate data. The low rate of resightings of banded birds (two up to 2013) suggests a population of hundreds if not thousands of birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Little Barrier Island/Hauturu is free of introduced mammal predators following the eradication of feral cats in 1980 and Pacific rats in 2004. It is remarkable that the storm petrels persisted (undetected) in the presence of cats and rats. The birds should thrive as long as the island is maintained pest-free. The conservation status of this species was changed from Data Deficient to Nationally Endangered in 2013, then to Nationally Vulnerable in 2016 as it was evident that the population was much larger than than earlier estimates.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The first New Zealand storm petrel nests were discovered in February 2013 by radio-tracking birds caught at sea. The burrows up to May 2013 were crevice-like&#xA0;in crumbly, rocky, litter-covered ground under forest, and contained downy chicks expected to fledge in late May or June.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand storm petrels are generally solitary at sea. On calm days they can be observed sitting with other seabirds (e.g. fairy prion, Buller&#x2019;s shearwater, Cook&#x2019;s petrel). Groups of 10-20 birds can gather if attracted to chum.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Regurgitations from captured New Zealand storm petrels, while few, have included crustaceans. They feed by dipping and surface-seizing, and on occasion by shallow-plunging.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Storm_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Storm_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30105\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=30105</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Flood, B. 2003.

After breeding they migrate to tropical seas south of the equator, hence the scientific name which was based on birds taken just south of the equator in the Atlantic.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the New Zealand region they are something of a mystery. Although not uncommon at sea, black-bellied storm petrels are poorly known on land. Few ornithologists&#xA0;have been on breeding colonies when they are active, as they breed during the autumn after most research expeditions have departed. In fact the eggs of the black-bellied storm petrel have been seen&#xA0;three times&#xA0;only in the New Zealand region &#x2013; in 1929 and 2018&#xA0;&#x2013; and&#xA0;chicks have never&#xA0;been seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Black-bellied storm petrels are black with a white band over the rump, and with white under the wings and on the flanks. A broad black stripe usually runs down the centre of the belly but it may be broken or absent altogether. They are large and very bulky for a storm petrel and have long legs so that the feet can be seen beyond the tail in flight. The legs and feet are black.</p>\n<p>Black-bellied storm petrels are often seen gliding close to the surface of the water with the wings held horizontally or about 45&#xB0; up, kicking with one foot, the other trailing and may cut the water by dropping a foot to leave an obvious wake.</p>\n<p>Voice: black-bellied storm petrels are silent at sea; on the breeding colonies, birds on the ground give a drawn-out shrill whistle.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the most commonly seen black-and-white storm petrel around New Zealand is Wilson&#x2019;s storm petrel which is smaller and entirely black underneath (though with a similar white band over the rump) and has yellow webs on the black feet. Off the northern New Zealand coast New Zealand storm petrel is a smaller, more slightly built bird that is white, not solidly black under the tail. The white belly of New Zealand storm petrel is characteristically and obviously streaked. The white-bellied storm petrel is rarely seen away from subtropical water and is very difficult to distinguish. It is a little smaller with shorter legs that do not extend beyond the tail. They usually have a clean white belly but the birds breeding on Lord Howe Island may be darker, with varying amounts of smudgy black on the belly and under-wing, some birds being entirely black.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black-bellied storm petrels are highly pelagic birds that feed close to or beyond the continental shelf. In summer the birds feed in the Southern Ocean, spread between the Ross Sea in the south and as far north as the southern coasts of New Zealand. Locally they breed on the Auckland and Antipodes Islands (with eggs recorded from Adams, Rose and Enderby Islands in the Auckland Islands). As yet no nests have been found on the Antipodes Islands and it has been suggested that the active colonies are on the smaller islands of the group, with mice not allowing successful breeding on the main island.</p>\n<p>After breeding, black-bellied storm petrels migrate to tropical and sub-tropical seas. They travel north in May and June and south in October and November.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>Black-bellied storm petrels are poorly known in the New Zealand region, but the local population has been estimated at 50,000 to 100,000 pairs. Tens of thousands of pairs were estimated as being on the main Antipodes Island and colonies on the Auckland Islands are thought to be larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>On the Auckland Islands, black-bellied storm petrels breed on outlying islands in the absence of exotic mammalian predators and are likely to have been exterminated from Campbell Island and the main Auckland Island by Norway rats and cats respectively. On the main Antipodes Island they co-occur with mice, but no nests with eggs or chicks have been found, and so it is not known if the storm petrels are able to breed successfully. The actual colonies there may be restricted to the smaller mouse-free islands of the group, some of which have never been landed on.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Black-bellied storm petrels nest in colonies, in cavities among loose rocks or excavated burrows in soil and peat. They are monogamous and pair bonds appear to be maintained until one partner dies.&#xA0; The only known nests with eggs found in New Zealand were found on Adams Island, Auckland Islands on 1 February 1929. The eggs were in two tiny burrows about 45 cm long, in a nest&#xA0;of dry fine grass.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black-bellied storm petrels are pelagic seabirds that feed over the continental shelf and the very deep water beyond. They are usually solitary but may gather into small groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of black-bellied storm petrel is poorly known, but includes crustaceans, small fish and squid taken from the surface of the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3973\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3973</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The species has a few widely dispersed breeding sites in the South Pacific, South Atlantic and South Indian Oceans and was only discovered nesting in the New Zealand region in 1966. The specific name is derived from the Latin <em>grallae</em> meaning stilts, which is presumed to refer to the birds&#x2019; long legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The white-bellied storm petrel is a small black-and-white storm petrel with a black &#x2018;hood&#x2019; and a white rump. Dorsally the plumage is mainly blackish but birds in fresh plumage have distinctive white tips to their dorsal feathers. Ventrally the feathers are largely white but the plumage can be variable, so that the rump and underside may have considerable numbers of darker feathers (observed on Curtis Island, Kermadec Islands). At Lord Howe, some birds are almost entirely dark. The beak, legs and feet (including webs and claws) are black and the claws are distinctly flattened. Birds of all ages and sexes have similar plumage.</p>\n<p>Voice: white-bellied storm petrels are generally silent but birds at nest sites give soft high-pitched twittering calls, such as <em>pee-pee-pee-pee</em> repeated up to 20 times.</p>\n<p>Similar species: white-bellied storm petrels can be confused with other black-and-white storm petrels, but all these have relatively longer legs, with feet that usually project beyond the tail in flight. Wilson&#x2019;s storm petrels are smaller, always have a dark underside and have yellow webs. Black-bellied storm petrels usually have a black stripe or mark along their central belly. New Zealand storm petrels have irregular black streaking on the underside.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Within the New Zealand region and Tasman Sea, the white-bellied storm petrel breeds only at the Lord Howe and Kermadec Islands. It is a pelagic seabird so spends most of its life at sea and, in New Zealand waters, is usually seen only near the Kermadec Islands. There are six claimed records from further south, but&#xA0;most of the sight records may have been of New Zealand storm petrels, which were not considered as a possibility before their rediscovery in 2003. Records reported as white-bellied storm petrels include: 2 off Farewell Spit (November 1969), off the Poor Knights Islands (December 1969), Waikawa Beach (July 1975), Ninety Mile Beach (April 1978), Piha Beach (May 1985), Hauraki Gulf (January 1991); only the 1978 record is undoubtedly this species. The local subspecies of white-bellied storm petrel has a mainly tropical distribution and ranges or migrates as far as the Coral Sea and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, but some remain close to the breeding colonies throughout most of the year.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The white-bellied storm petrel is rare in New Zealand. Up to 700 have been estimated to nest on Macauley and Curtis Islands in the Kermadec group, with the stronghold being Curtis Island where 23 adults were caught in 1989. More than 1,000 pairs may nest at the Lord Howe group but the species is extinct on the main island. Rare at-sea sightings off the Kermadec Islands are normally of single birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Poorly known. On Curtis Island, a single, long-abandoned fragmentary egg, thought to be of white-bellied storm petrel, was found in 1989, and a small downy chick, estimated to be three weeks old, was found on 21 May 1982, which suggests that laying occurs from April. A dead nearly-fledged chick was found on Macauley Island on 3 August 1966, which indicates that it came from an egg laid in April-May. At other nesting sites, the species breeds in loose colonies and the egg and chick period is January to May.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The rarity of this species partly accounts for its relative inconspicuousness both ashore and at sea. Ashore it is strictly nocturnal. At sea, white-bellied storm petrels fly low above the water, usually gliding and pushing off the water&#x2019;s surface with their legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>White-bellied storm petrels consume small squids and crustaceans but little detail is known.

It occurs from the Three Kings Islands south to Campbell Island and east to the Chatham Islands. Although it doesn&#x2019;t form dense flocks, hundreds can be in view at a time, looking like miniature penguins on the sea surface, or buzzing over the wave crests. Diving petrels are remarkably similar in appearance and behaviour to little auks (dovekies) of Arctic seas, but the two are not closely related (auks are more closely related to gulls and terns). This is the most frequently cited example of convergent evolution among birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The common diving petrel is a small, chunky seabird; black above and grey-and-white below, with a stubby black bill and blue feet. With their short whirring wings and characteristic straight-line flight close to the sea surface, diving petrels are instantly recognisable. The only confusion risk is that there are two species in New Zealand, but the second species (South Georgian diving petrel) is so rare here that it has never been reliably identified at sea. Common diving petrels are extremely variable in the extent of white on the throat and underwing, and birds in fresh plumage (especially fledglings) also have pale stripes down the scapulars &#x2013; a character sometimes referred to as diagnostic for South Georgian diving petrel. For these reasons, careful inspection of birds in the hand is the only way that South Georgian diving petrels could be identified away from the sole New Zealand breeding site on Codfish Island.</p>\n<p>Voice: common diving petrels do not call at sea, but are very vocal at night on and over their breeding grounds. The main call is a musical croon with an upward inflection. Calls of the two sexes are readily distinguished, with males having a simpler call, and females a stutter at the start.</p>\n<p>Similar species: South Georgian diving petrels are very similar in size and structure but have&#xA0;whiter underwings and often have&#xA0;grey on the ear coverts. The tail may be distinctly forked in some individuals.&#xA0;The plumage differences are quite subtle, and South Georgian diving petrels are very unlikely to be separable from common diving petrels at sea. The white-tipped feathers along the base of the wing, and dark line on the&#xA0;back of the leg&#xA0;(often reported as diagnostic of South Georgian diving petrels) occur in juveniles of both species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Common diving petrels are extremely vulnerable to introduced predators, including rats, stoats, cats and weka. They are mainly found on small islands that have never had predators introduced.&#xA0; Fortunately there are many such islands, or islands that have been cleared of predators, and common diving petrels breed on more than 70 islands scattered over 17 degrees of latitude from the Three Kings Islands south to Campbell Island. Important New Zealand breeding sites are listed below. Elsewhere, common diving petrels breed on islands off south-east Australia, and on many islands in the subantarctic zones of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Preferred breeding sites are steep coastal slopes with dense ground cover and shallow soils (otherwise their burrows are taken over by larger petrel species). During the day they are most often seen over the open sea near breeding colonies; they rarely enter sheltered coastal waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are probably more than a million pairs in the New Zealand region, but few accurate colony estimates have been made. Large colonies include those on the Three Kings Islands, Cavalli Islands, Chicken Islands, Middle and Green Islands (Mercury Islands), Alderman Islands, Sugarloaf Islands (New Plymouth), Trio Islands (Marlborough Sounds), Rangatira Island (Chatham Islands), Little Solander Island, Snares Islands and Antipodes Islands. Common diving petrels are the fifth most common bird found dead on New Zealand beaches, at an average rate of 0.16 birds per km. The largest wreck was of 3593 birds in 1975.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Common diving petrels have been extirpated by predators on many islands, including by feral cats on Mangere and Herekopare Islands, weka on Jacky Lee Island, and ship rats on Solomon Island. One stoat killed 90 adults on Motuotau Island off Mt Maunganui before it was trapped in 1996. Bones have been found at many mainland sites, indicating where breeding sites occurred before the introduction of Pacific rats by Maori. Their main natural predators at island breeding sites are subantarctic skuas, southern black-backed gulls and swamp harriers. Over 700 were killed by the Rena oil spill in Bay of Plenty in late 2011 (more than any other species).</p>\n<p>Few actions specifically targeted at conservation of common diving petrels have been undertaken. These included translocation of fully-grown chicks to Mana Island (1997-99), Motuora Island (2007-09), and Cape Kidnappers (2011 and ongoing). Other more generic island restoration projects (especially pest mammal and weka eradications) have and will benefit common diving petrel populations, including on the Mokohinau Islands, Mercury Islands, Mangere Island (Chatham Islands) and on several muttonbird islands near Stewart Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Common diving petrels are colonial breeders, nesting in short burrows, rock crevices or under dense vegetation. The breeding season is earlier in the north, with peak laying of the single egg in August in the Mercury Islands, and mid-October on the Snares Islands. Incubation is shared and takes about 53 days. The chick is left unattended during daylight when 9-15 days old. Both parents visit most nights and feed the chick by regurgitation, right through to fledging at 44-55 days old. Young birds return to colonies when 1-2 years old, and first breed when 1-3 years old. They are the only petrel species known to breed at a year old (2 females and 1 male recorded on Mana Island). The common diving petrel is one of few petrel species that can lay a replacement egg if the first egg fails early in incubation.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Common diving petrels often occur in large, dispersed flocks at sea. They are not attracted to boats and are non-migratory, staying in New Zealand waters throughout the year. Birds can be found ashore at colonies in any month of the year, though few are present for 1-2 months after breeding (January-February in Cook Strait). They excavate their own burrows, and breed as monogamous pairs, which can remain together over many seasons (though divorces are frequent). Common diving petrels visit breeding sites after dark and depart before dawn, or stay in burrows or nest crevices during daylight. Colonies can be low density, or up to 6 burrows per square metre.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Common diving petrels mainly eat small pelagic crustaceans, especially the krill <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em> and copepods. Prey is captured by pursuit diving, with the partially folded wings used for propulsion. Diving petrels are well named &#x2013; they have remarkable diving ability for their size.&#xA0; A New Zealand study of 6 birds recorded a mean dive depth of 11 metres and a maximum of 22 metres, but they have been recorded diving to depths of 64 metres off the Kerguelen Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Diving_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Diving_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bocher, P.; Labidoire, B.; Cherel, Y. 2000: Maximum dive depths of common diving-petrels (<em>Pelecanoides urinatrix</em>) during the annual cycle at Mayes Island, Kerguelen. <em>Journal of Zoology, London 251</em>: 517-524.</p>\n<p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

They are superbly adapted for diving for prey and have dense plumage to insulate their small bodies. The species generally breeds on high open scree fields above the vegetation line on cold subantarctic islands. However, in the New Zealand region, the birds nest at sea level in sand dunes near the subtropical convergence. This major difference in habitat preference has led some biologists to think that the New Zealand birds might be a different species and work is underway to investigate the taxonomy of these birds. A preliminary study suggested that the New Zealand birds had diverged from populations breeding in the Indian Ocean. Diving petrels as a group feed on small plankton (copepods, krill) and juvenile fish. The only remaining New Zealand population of South Georgian diving petrels occurs in the sand dunes at Sealers Bay, Codfish Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The South Georgian diving petrel is a small black-and-white petrel (tube-nosed seabird) with very short rounded wings and a short tail which are designed more for diving activities than flight. Birds have a dark capped head but with grey feathering behind the eyes which extends up like ear-muffs. The entire upper surface is black including the upper wings. The feathers of the rump have white bases. The tail is distinctively forked in some individuals in the New Zealand population. The undersides including underwings are white. In the hand, the short bill (13-16 mm long) is black with pale blue edges. The legs and feet are mostly blue with some black margins.</p>\n<p>Voice: the calls of South Georgian diving petrels are&#xA0;plaintive mewings,&#xA0;distinctive from those of close relatives. Male and female calls are separable in the field.</p>\n<p>Similar species: common diving petrels are very similar in size and structure but have duskier grey-white underwings and all dark feathers on the rump. The tail is always square tipped. The sides of the head behind the eyes are darkish. The bill has small differences in shape to those of South Georgian diving petrels. The plumage differences are quite subtle, and South Georgian diving petrels are very unlikely to be separable from common diving petrels at sea. The white-tipped feathers along the base of the wing and dark line on the tarsus edge (often reported as diagnostic) occur in juveniles of both species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The sole remaining breeding ground in New Zealand is on Codfish Island, near Stewart Island. The birds formerly nested on Enderby and Dundas Islands at the Auckland Islands. Subfossil bones indicate they previously nested on Stewart Island and possibly on Chatham and Macquarie Islands. Elsewhere, South Georgian diving petrels nest on subantarctic Heard, Kerguelen, Crozet and South Georgia Islands. On Codfish Island the birds nest in sand dunes behind Sealers Bay. Some nests are at the base of dunes at the back of the beach whereas others are amongst native or introduced coastal dune vegetation on the dune slopes. All nests are within 100 m of the sea. Nest sites are in very unstable sand and it is nearly impossible to access the nests without destroying these sites. The at-sea range of the species in the New Zealand region is unknown. Elsewhere they feed in cold water near convergence zones and on the edge of the continental shelf. They are very competent divers and spend much of the day underwater.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand population of South Georgian diving petrels has fewer than 150 individuals. Thus it is one of the rarest breeding species in New Zealand. Elsewhere the species is extremely abundant with an estimated world population of 15 million birds. Resolving the taxonomy of this group is important as the New Zealand birds may represent a cryptic and highly endangered species.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The population of South Georgian diving petrels on Codfish Island is highly threatened. In 2003, a single storm event eroded a large amount of the dune habitat and many birds perished as the dunes collapsed. The dunes are also shrinking as coastal forest habitat expands from the landward side of the dunes. Introduced exotic grasses and herbs are also spreading on the dunes and their roots choke the burrows of the petrels. Some native rushes also create a similar problem. High quality native dune habitat is still present but is likely to diminish over time without active management. Human disturbance and burrow trampling is a threat and access to the dune areas is restricted. There are no current at-sea threats for this species, however, a local oil spill would be a disaster. Common diving petrels were one of the major victims of the Rena oil spill in the Bay of Plenty in 2011. Conservation measures to date have included locating and marking active burrows, catching and marking birds to determine population size, and weed control. Exotic marram grass has been eradicated from the dunes at Sealers Bay. The current focus is on resolving the taxonomy of these birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>South Georgian diving petrels breed from September to February, but details are very poorly known in New Zealand as the unstable sand dune nest sites are too fragile to allow study. Elsewhere, the birds lay a single white egg and share incubation and chick rearing duties. The chicks are fed daily, usually by both parents.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>South Georgian diving petrels are nocturnally active at their breeding colonies. The birds fly in directly and land very close to their nest site. Birds only begin returning once it gets quite dark. Prospecting birds can be found on the surface at night but are quiet. Some birds call occasionally in flight. The calls are similar to those of common diving petrels but are easily separable with comparative experience. At sea, South Georgian diving petrels spend much of the day diving for prey items and can dive to depths of 50 m. Diving petrels collectively have a distinctive flight action with fast whirring wings.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet of South Georgian diving petrels is poorly known in New Zealand. Krill and juvenile fish and squid were found in two specimens. Krill and copepods are the major diet items at other colony sites. The species mostly feeds by day. Unlike other petrels, diving petrels do not produce stomach oil to feed their chicks.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Georgia_Diving_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Georgia_Diving_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3950\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3950</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://faunarecovery.org.nz/south-georgian-diving-petrel\">http://faunarecovery.org.nz/south-georgian-diving-petrel</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. 2004. <em>Albatrosses and petrels across the world</em>.

Its plumage appears predominantly white, the tail streamers and bill are bright red. Red-tailed tropicbirds are mostly seen over the open ocean.

On close view, the feather shafts are dark grey and the head and body plumage show a remarkable pink suffusion. The bill is bright red; the dark-brown iris is shielded by a black eye-patch. The subspecies <em>P. r. roseotinctus</em> is distinguished by its longer bill and wings, and by the intensity of the pink suffusion. In immature birds, the plumage is barred black and white, with bold black on the outer wing feathers, the bill is dark grey to reddish colour, and the tail streamers are lacking.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: harsh, sometimes stretched-out guttural calls, trumpet-like growls and snarls, and loud cackling. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: adult white-tailed tropicbirds are pristine white with yellow bills, &#xA0;white tail streamers, and black markings on the inner upperwing. Immature white-tailed tropicbirds are smaller and more lightly built than their red-tailed cousins, have a paler grey or yellow bill, and have a lesser extent of black on the outer wing.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-tailed tropicbirds breed in the tropical and subtropical Indian and Pacific Oceans, their at-sea distribution extends into warm temperate seas. The only New Zealand breeding sites are located on the Kermadec Islands, where they breed on Raoul Island, North Meyer, South Meyer, Nugent, Dayrell and South Chanter Islets, and Macauley and Curtis Islands. They are regularly seen at the Three Kings Islands, and there are about 40 records from the northern half of the North Island, with one as far south as Akaroa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-tailed tropicbirds feed over the open ocean, seeking cool, low salinity, nutrient-rich waters. &#xA0;Nest sites are typically in coastal cliff crevices or on ledges that have some sheltering vegetation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 50-100 pairs of red-tailed tropicbirds breed on Raoul Island and adjacent islets. Up to 130 have been seen over Macauley Island, but no breeding population estimate is available. About 1000 pairs breed on Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands. All New Zealand breeding sites are now free of introduced predators. Elsewhere in their breeding range, nesting birds are vulnerable to dogs and feral cats, and rats may take eggs or chicks. El Ni&#xF1;o events have caused breeding failures and drops in population numbers in the eastern and central Pacific.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-tailed tropicbirds nest solitarily or form loose breeding colonies, where suitable nesting sites are available. The prolonged breeding season extends from December to August. On the Kermadec Islands, laying typically peaks in December and January, with most nests containing young from mid-January to May. Nestlings have been found as late as&#xA0;August. The timing of breeding can vary substantially from year to year. The nest scrape is dug with the feet and is defended as territory and re-used across years. A single egg is laid, though replacement laying can occur after egg loss. Both sexes share incubation and chick provisioning. Food is delivered to the chick by regurgitation, with the parent inserting its bill into the chick&#x2019;s gorge. The chick is semi-altricial, downy at hatching, and independent of its parents at fledging.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The pair-bond is monogamous and often retained across seasons. Pairs that raise their chick successfully are more likely to breed together in subsequent years. Birds perform aerial displays in groups close to the breeding sites, which play a role in mate choice. At sea, red-tailed tropicbirds are mostly seen foraging solitarily or in pairs. The flight is characterized by slow regular wing beats alternating with gliding. Prey is caught by plunge-diving. Red-tailed tropicbirds are highly mobile, and disperse widely over tropical and subtropical seas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-tailed tropicbird diet at the Kermadec Islands has not been studied. Elsewhere they feed chiefly on fish (predominantly flying fish and clupeids) and cephalopods, with a small proportion of crustaceans.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks &#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Tropicbird\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Tropicbird</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3649\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3649</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Dunlop, J.N.; Wooller, R.D.; Cheshire, N.G. 1988.

During the breeding season mottled petrels are usually seen alone, well offshore off southern New Zealand and even feeding among the pack-ice north of the Ross Sea. After breeding they migrate to the North Pacific and occur as far north as the Bering Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The mottled petrel is a medium-sized petrel with a short black bill, long broad wings, and long, narrow tapering tail. The upperparts are dark grey, with a distinct darker M-marking. The face is mottled grey and white, with a dark patch across each eye. The underparts are white, except for a smudgy grey patch across the lower breast and belly and a prominent black band diagonally across the underwing from the bend in the wing towards the body. The legs and feet are pink with black tips to the webs, but are not usually seen when the bird is in flight. The smudgy grey band across the lower breast and belly is, however, readily seen in flight and is a reliable identification feature for this species.</p>\n<p>Voice: mottled petrels are usually silent at sea, but can be very vocal over the breeding colonies at night, especially during courtship. The main call is a rapid <em>ti-ti-ti</em>&#x2026; or <em>kek-kek-kek</em>&#x2026;, but they may also give <em>oooi</em> and <em>gorr </em>calls. On the ground they may give the main flight calls and the growling <em>gor-wik</em> call, the latter usually in response to the calls of other birds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the size of the bird with its short black bill and smudgy grey belly and conspicuous black band across the underwing against the otherwise white underparts ensure that this species is readily identifiable and unlikely to be confused with any other species. However in brief or distant observations mottled petrels may be confused with soft-plumaged petrels. The latter species have a smudgy-grey breast band and wholly dark underwings compared with the broader smudgy-grey patch across the lower breast and belly and contrasting black and white underwings of mottled petrels.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Mottled petrels are highly pelagic and are usually seen beyond the continental shelf when away from the breeding islands. During the course of the year the mottled petrel occurs throughout most of the Pacific Ocean. It breeds only in southern New Zealand, primarily on The Snares, Codfish Island and Big South Cape Island, with small colonies on other islands around Stewart Island and in Fiordland. Previously, it bred on inland foothills of both the North and South Islands. During the breeding season (October-May) mottled petrels occur throughout New Zealand subantarctic waters, and make trips of about 2000 km each way to forage in the vicinity of the Polar Front at about 65&#xB0;S, especially when gathering food for their young. After breeding, birds from New Zealand migrate to the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea before returning to New Zealand for the following breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The major colonies on The Snares, Codfish Island and Big South Cape Island are each estimated to comprise over 10,000 breeding pairs. In addition, there are a few small colonies on other muttonbird islands around Stewart Island, on islands off Fiordland and one on an island in Lake Hauroko.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Introduced mammals, particularly feral cats, rats, mustelids, feral pigs and dogs have had a significant impact on breeding colonies. Although previously breeding on inland hill country of both the North and South Islands all these mainland breeding colonies have been extirpated as a result of predation and changed land use. Large breeding populations are now restricted to predator-free offshore islands. Mottled petrels migrate to the North Pacific Ocean, where they may be at greater risk from pollutants and gill net fisheries.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Mottled petrels breed in large, dense colonies to sparsely aggregated pairs. They are monogamous with shared incubation and chick care. The nest is lined with leaf litter and is in a chamber at the end of a burrow. Birds tend to return to the same area from year to year, but may not use the same burrow in successive years. The single large (61 x 44 mm) white egg is laid from early December to early January. Incubation takes 48-53 days. The chicks fledge in May-early June at about 90-105 days of age, and are independent at fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>At sea, mottled petrels occur singly, although in the area of the Antarctic Convergence several may be seen following a similar flight path. Usually they feed by dipping their bill and face into the sea whilst still in flight, but occasionally they land on the sea to peck at small prey either on or just under the surface.</p>\n<p>Mottled petrels nest in colonies and during the breeding season they start to arrive at the colonies about 50 minutes after sunset. During the early part of the breeding season colonies are very busy and noisy with birds cleaning out burrows and others courting. During this period and into the incubation period they respond to man-made calls, such as war-whooping. Mottled petrels are annual breeders that usually return to the area year after year, often with the same partner. After breeding the colonies are deserted and the birds migrate to the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, arriving back at the breeding colonies from mid-October. There have been no long term studies of banded birds, and so there is no information about annual survival and longevity.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Mottled petrels mainly eat lantern fish, squid, and krill. Most prey are taken from near the surface of the sea whilst the bird is in flight, but they will land on the water to feed on prey at or near the surface.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Harper, P.C. 1987.

Occasional birds range further west to eastern Australia and New Zealand, where it has been recorded most often at the Chatham Islands. The frequency of sightings on Rangatira Island, Chatham Islands, including of a bird on the ground at night, suggests this species has attempted to colonise.

It is similar in size to a sooty shearwater, but with markings like an oversized Cook&#x2019;s petrel. The upperparts are silvery-grey, darker on the wings and tail, with a dark grey cap and blackish eye-patch separated from the large black bill by clear white forehead. In fresh plumage there is a pronounced dark &#x2018;M&#x2019; from wingtip to wingtip across the lower back, contrasting with the silvery back, mantle and inner forewing. As plumage wears, the entire upperwing appears dark. When moulting, pale bases to nape feathers may show as a narrow white hind-collar (cf. white-naped petrel), and the rump can similarly appear pale. The underparts are white apart from dark tips and trailing edge to the wing, a small but variable black carpal bar extending diagonally in from the elbow joint, and dark tips to the tail feathers. The Juan Fernandez petrel is a graceful, effortless flier compared to smaller relatives.</p>\n<p>Voice: &#xA0;at night over breeding colonies Juan Fernandez petrels give a sighing whistle sometimes followed by a harsh bark or <em>wowk</em>. Also a booming <em>boo-boo-boo</em> from the air or on the ground.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Juan Fernandez petrel is very similar in size and structure to the white-naped petrel, which always has a bold white hind-neck contrasting strongly with the blackish cap. The very similar Barau&#x2019;s petrel from the southern Indian Ocean (not yet recorded from New Zealand) is slightly smaller and has a more prominent black carpal bar on the otherwise white underwing. The much smaller Cook&#x2019;s and Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels have similar plumage but are smaller winged and have more vigorous wing action and erratic flight. Buller&#x2019;s shearwater has similar plumage but longer, slimmer bill, dark forehead, and different shape (with a smaller head, longer neck and longer tail) and flight, mainly staying close to the sea. Juan Fernandez petrel and other gadfly petrels tower up in arcs with wings held vertical.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Juan Fernandez petrel is a pelagic seabird of the eastern Pacific Ocean, that only comes to land to breed (though note birds apparently prospecting at the Chatham Islands). It breeds only on the Chilean island of Mas-a-fuera (Isla Alejandro Selkirk) in the Juan Fernandez Islands, and migrates north to tropical North Pacific seas between Hawaii and Mexico. Occasional birds range further west to Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The first New Zealand record was a storm-wrecked bird found in inland Waikato in October 1971. The specimen was sent to Auckland Museum, where it was initially identified as the similar white-naped petrel from the Kermadec Islands. At least two birds were present on Rangatira Island, Chatham Islands between 1984 and 1999, where one was killed by a skua in December 1989, and one was found in a burrow in March 1997. One was seen on nearby Mangere Island in January 1988, and another at the Tuku light site (where Chatham Island taiko are lured in for capture) on Chatham Island in October 1997. The most recent sightings, and the only at-sea sightings in New Zealand,&#xA0;were off the Otago coast in March 2012, and off East Cape in February 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Juan Fernandez petrels breed on ridges at high altitudes (above 750 m) on Mas-a-fuera, where the single white egg is laid in November in burrows 2-3 m long. Both parents share incubation (c.60 days) and chick-rearing (90-100 days). Eggs hatch in February and chicks fledge in May.</p>\n<p>Juan Fernandez petrels occur solitarily or in loose flocks at sea, sometimes with other seabirds (e.g. pink-footed shearwaters near the breeding island). The bird off the Otago coast was among a large flock of sooty shearwaters, but flying by itself. They have typical gadfly petrel flight, high banking with wings held vertical and the carpal (elbow) joint pushed forward, alternating with glides close to the sea surface.

Nearly its entire population nests at Macauley Island in the Kermadec group. It is a pelagic species and so is generally only seen from boats. The white-naped petrel was originally described from Raoul Island, but was extirpated there by introduced cats and rats, and subsequently considered to be extinct. &#xA0;It was rediscovered on Macauley Island in 1966, where the population increased to 50,000 pairs following goat eradication. A few pairs breed on Phillip Island off Norfolk Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The white-naped petrel is a large grey-and-white petrel with a distinctive black cap and white nape. The black cap covers the crown and the sides of the head to just below the eye, contrasting with the white forehead and nape. A broad white collar separates the cap from the grey mantle and back feathers which have white fringes in fresh plumage. However the worn plumage of adults makes them look much darker above. The rest of the upper surface is grey with a blackish rump and a blackish &apos;M&apos; mark from wing-tip to wing-tip. The underside is mainly white apart from a partial grey collar, mainly black flight feathers and a narrow black band along the leading edge of the underwing tapering inwards to a point behind the elbow. The bill is long and black; the legs and feet are pinkish with the terminal half of the feet black. Birds of all ages and sexes have similar plumage, but fledglings (May-June) in fresh silvery-grey dorsal plumage look very different to the worn chocolate-brown adults at the same time of year.</p>\n<p>Voice: white-naped petrels are silent at sea but noisy on and over their colony, where the main flight calls are variants on a loud <em>ooo kek-kek-kek-kek-kek</em> and the main ground call is a repetitive <em>eh eh eh</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Vanuatu petrel (not recorded from New Zealand) has identical plumage, but is slightly smaller with a proportionately longer tail. Of species recorded from New Zealand, the Juan Fernandez petrel (a very rare vagrant) is most similar to the white-naped petrel, differing in having a grey (cf. white) hind-neck. The other large petrel with a distinctive white collar that may occur in the New Zealand region is the great shearwater (also a very rare vagrant), which has the long thin bill of all shearwaters, a prominent dusky belly patch, a white crescent on the uppertail, and dusky marks in the wing-pit. Buller&apos;s shearwaters are superficially similar but have a long slender bill, a dark forehead, an almost pure white underwing, a more wedge-shaped tail, and lack the white hind-neck.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The white-naped petrel breeds only at Macauley Island (Kermadec Islands), apart from a few pairs that have colonised Phillip Island (Norfolk group) recently. It formerly bred on Raoul Island (Kermadec Islands) but was wiped out there by cats and rats by about 1914. Fortunately a previously unknown population was discovered on Macauley Island in 1966 and, since the eradication of goats there, this population has undergone a massive expansion so that it now holds approximately 50,000 pairs. The white-naped petrel feeds mainly well out to sea, spending most of its life in tropical and subtropical waters and only rarely reaching latitudes of the North Island of New Zealand (exceptionally Stewart Island). During the breeding season it is commonly seen at sea near the Kermadecs and in the south-west Pacific Ocean. In the non-breeding season (May - November) it migrates to the northern hemisphere, mainly to the south-east of Japan; it is rarely seen in the central and eastern tropical Pacific.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>About 50,000 pairs of white-naped petrels were estimated to nest on Macauley Island in 1988. A tiny population of 10 - 100 breeding pairs has established on Phillip Island, Norfolk group, since 1992.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Little is known of the breeding ecology of the white-naped petrel. At the extinct Raoul Island colony, they were reported to return in late September or October but none was seen at Macauley Island by 24 September 1988, and at Phillip Island birds have first been reported on 11 November. On Macauley Island, courtship occurs in late November. On Raoul Island, eggs were laid in late December - early January, but at Phillip Island laying occurs from 8 - 31 January. Hatching occurs at Phillip Island from 22 February. Young depart from late May to June, when about 100-115 days old. As for all petrels, white-naped petrels are monogamous, lay a single large (66 x 47 mm) white egg per year, and have shared incubation and chick-care.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>White-naped petrel flight is graceful and effortless, with few wing-beats. They are mainly nocturnal at the Macauley Island colony, but the earliest birds come ashore as the sun sets. White-naped petrels are usually solitary at sea, but form loose feeding flocks with other seabirds.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>White-naped petrels feed by dipping, aerial pursuit and surface-seizing. Their diet is poorly known, but includes squid.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3884\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3884</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/white-necked-petrel-pterodroma-cervicalis\">http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/white-necked-petrel-pterodroma-cervicalis</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

The largest colonies are on the Kermadec Islands, 1000 km north-east of New Zealand. They are one of the commonest seabirds in northern New Zealand but few people have seen them as they feed far out at sea. They feed on small crustaceans and squid, mostly picked off the ocean surface during long distance flights covering many thousands of kilometres. Black-winged petrels are the most abundant species in the <em>Pterodroma </em>petrel group (34 species). New colonies are forming around New Zealand as the species expands in numbers and range.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The black-winged petrel is a small grey-and-white gadfly petrel with narrow wings and a pointed tail in flight. It has a pale-grey head with black-and-white speckling on the forehead and a dark eye patch. The upper surface is grey contrasting with darker brown-black feathers running across the upper wings and rump. An extensive grey collar extends onto the otherwise white underparts. The underwing is mostly white but has a diagnostic broad dark line on the leading edge of the outer wing; this continues as a broad black diagonal stripe on the inner wing, reaching towards, but not meeting, the mid base of the wing. In the hand, the black bill (23-26 mm long, 10-12 mm deep) has a sharp hook to seize prey. The legs are usually pink but can be blue or mauve.</p>\n<p>Voice: black-winged petrel calls are mainly high-pitched whistles (<em>whis-whis-whis </em>or<em> wee-wee-wee</em>) and lower-pitched ground calls (<em>ha-ha-ha</em>).</p>\n<p>Similar species: Cook&#x2019;s and Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels have a shorter and thinner black leading edge on the under-wing; Gould&#x2019;s petrel has a darker head forming an extensive dark cap; Chatham petrel has the dark under-wing bar extending to diagnostic dark axillaries (&#x2018;armpit&#x2019; feathers).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black-winged petrels breed in colonies on the Kermadec Islands (all islands and islets), Three Kings Islands, Motuopao, Matapia, Simmonds, Motukokako, Burgess, East and Portland Islands. There are also small numbers on Rangatira and Mangere Islands in the Chatham Islands. Elsewhere, they breed on Phillip and Lord Howe Islands, and islets off New Caledonia and Rapa Island. Recently, they were confirmed breeding on Round Island in the Indian Ocean. The eradication of rats and cats on Raoul Island has seen a rapid expansion of black-winged petrels back onto this former breeding site.</p>\n<p>Black-winged petrels nest in burrows anywhere there is suitable soil including under forest, shrubs, sedges, ferns and grass. They can also nest on the surface under dense cover of grass and sedges, and some birds nest in rock crevices. Black-winged petrels forage mainly over sub-tropical waters north of the sub-tropical convergence zone. They forage over deep water beyond the continental shelf and seldom feed close to the breeding islands. After breeding they migrate to the North Pacific Ocean, to an area north-west of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Black-winged petrels are one of the most abundant seabirds in New Zealand. The colony of 2-3 million pairs on 282 ha Macauley Island (Kermadec Islands) is the largest seabird breeding site in New Zealand and one of the largest seabird breeding colonies in the world. Another 300,000 pairs nest on nearby Curtis Island. Burrow densities reach 2/m2 on these islands. Elsewhere the colonies are much smaller with few holding more than a thousand pairs and some of the newly established sites have just a few tens of pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The major threat to black-winged petrels, as it is for all gadfly petrels, is the introduction of mammalian predators on their breeding grounds. Pacific rats were eradicated on Macauley Island in 2006, and Norway rats, Pacific rats and feral cats were eradicated on Raoul Island between 2002 and 2004. Most of the remaining breeding sites around New Zealand are free of introduced predators. Volcanic eruptions and fire are probably the main land-based threats remaining for this seabird. The risk to small gadfly petrels from fisheries impacts appears to be minimal.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The black-winged petrel breeding season is from October to May. Most birds breed annually and the same pairs can breed together and rear many chicks over multiple years. The single white egg (52 x 37 mm) is laid from late December to late January in a well-lined burrow chamber (burrows can be as short as 0.5 m). Both birds share incubation shifts of about 13-14 days, and the egg hatches after c.45 days, in February or March. The chick is fed at 2.5 day intervals, with each adult returning on average every 4.4 days. Meal-size remains constant throughout the chick-rearing period and averages 32.6 g. Chicks are not fed in the period 10 days prior to departure and are independent of the parents after fledging at c.85 days old. Related species return to colonies at 2-3 years of age and typically start breeding when 5-10 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black-winged petrels are unusual amongst New Zealand burrowing petrels in that many birds visit their breeding grounds throughout the day. Activity ashore increases after sunset. The sight and sounds of millions of petrels circling and calling over Macauley Island in the evening is spectacular, but witnessed by few people due to the remoteness of this site. At small colonies the far-carrying calls are usually the first indication that black-winged petrels are present. Calling on the ground is also common with the birds responding to low passes of birds calling in flight. Recent tracking studies have shown that black-winged petrels are capable of flying thousands of kilometres to locate food when breeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black-winged petrels have been recorded feeding on crustaceans and small squid. Activity recorders used on tracking devices indicate that the birds gather food both by day and night. Most food is caught in the top 2 m of the ocean&#x2019;s surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3883\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3883</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. 2004. <em>Albatrosses and petrels across the world</em>.

Competition with other seabirds for burrows on Rangatira (South East Island) further led to its decline. Active management allowed the population to recover to more than 150 pairs, and new colonies on Pitt and Chatham Island are being established.</p>\n<p>One chick is produced during the 7&#x2212;8 month breeding period, with parents sharing duties and foraging up to 3000 km from the colony. After breeding, birds follow an easterly migration route across the Pacific, over-wintering in deep waters off the South American coast.</p>\n<p>Chatham petrels are rarely seen at sea. Their unique underwing pattern separates them from similar small gadfly petrels.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham petrel is a medium-sized petrel; dark grey above, white below, with a mottled dark-grey and white forehead. A black diagonal bar extends from the leading edge of underwing to the diagnostic black &#x2018;armpit&#x2019;. The long, narrow wings are held stiffly as birds glide and wheel in flight. The bill is black and strongly hooked tip. The eye is dark, and the legs and feet are pink, with dark outer toes and webs. The sexes are alike. Chatham petrels are rarely observed away from the colony; the few at-sea records are from ships in oceanic waters.</p>\n<p>Voice: males give a high-pitched repetitive <em>whis-whis-whis...</em> from the air or ground; they commonly respond to &#x2018;war-whooping&#x2019;. Non-breeders are particularly vocal in flight over the breeding grounds. Females have a deeper <em>yap-yap-yap</em> call, and are less likely to respond to &#x2018;war-whooping&#x2019;. Both sexes also give a &#x2018;purring&#x2019; ground call.</p>\n<p>Similar species: black-winged petrel is similar, and breeds in low numbers on Rangatira; it differs in having much less black on the inner underwing. Mottled petrel is slightly larger with a dark belly and whiter underwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Introduction of alien mammals is considered the primary cause of the Chatham petrel&#x2019;s demise within the Chatham Island group. Following human colonisation, the species&#x2019; breeding range became restricted to a single predator-free location&#x2014;Rangatira (South East Island). Here, their burrows are scattered thinly amongst millions of other seabird burrows in fragile, largely endemic, mature forest habitat.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Tracking of adults carrying dataloggers reveals that at-sea distribution changes during different stages of breeding, and that the species makes an extensive trans-Pacific migration. When breeding, they forage over deep waters, 2000&#x2013;3000 km south-east of the Chatham Islands. During chick-rearing their foraging range, south of the Chatham Rise, is less extensive. After breeding, birds head east and north to ~1000 km from the coast of Peru and Chile. In spring, they depart the eastern Pacific ~3 weeks before arriving back at the colony.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham petrel is one of New Zealand&#x2019;s most endangered seabirds with an estimated population of around 2000 birds, now increasing. There are around 200 monitored active burrows. Since 2003, 100&#x2212;150 chicks have fledged annually.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham petrel was believed to be in decline before intervention in the 1990s. Research was initiated to locate burrows and determine causes for breeding failure. The species has since been intensively managed by the Department of Conservation to protect burrows from collapse, and to protect breeders and their vulnerable chicks from the robust and abundant broad-billed prion, another petrel species that competes for nesting chambers. Management improved breeding success from 30% of known breeding attempts producing fledglings, to 70&#x2013;80% from 2000 onwards. The population then sustained a series of translocations to establish additional colonies of the species within the Chatham Islands. Four-hundred chicks were translocated from Rangatira over eight seasons (2002&#x2212;2011) to two predator-free enclosures on Pitt and main Chatham Island. In 2012, 17 pairs were breeding on Pitt Island and the first second-generation birds, hatched and raised on Pitt, returned. On the main island, the first successful breeding event since pre-human times was also celebrated.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Successful breeding Chatham petrels stay together in long-term partnerships until one mate perishes or breeding attempts are disrupted. Pairs continue to use the same burrow, typically 0.5&#x2212;1 m long, each season. Adults return to land in late spring to prepare nests. Established pairings often synchronise their arrival to within a few days.</p>\n<p>After mating, the pair spends ~1 month at sea while the large (52 x 39 mm) white egg forms and the male conditions himself for the first incubation shift. The male then waits in the burrow for his mate to return and lay. They alternate incubation duty until the egg hatches 46 days later. Commonly, there are four shifts, with the female present at hatching; but, there may be up to five where the male attends the hatching egg. Parents brood the chick for 1&#x2212;2 days, then leave it unattended, returning every few nights to deliver food. Chicks emerge from burrows for around 10 nights from mid-April, to exercise and find suitable take-off trees. Parents tend to abandon chicks by this stage, commencing migration while chicks are fledging from late April to June.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham petrels are oceanic, only landing to breed, and arriving at and departing the colony during the night. They show strong site fidelity; the oldest known bird has bred in the same burrow for 24 years. Birds usually drop through the forest canopy within metres of their burrow. They are agile tree-climbers, scaling tall trees to exit the colony.</p>\n<p>When not breeding, Chatham petrels forage mainly at night. When provisioning hungry chicks, birds are active at sea around the clock.</p>\n<p>Non-breeders are known to be present at the colony in any month from November to May. Younger adults of ~2.5 years-old have been recovered towards the end of the season.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham petrels feed mainly on squid and fish collected from within a few metres of the sea surface. Chicks are fed by regurgitation, and receive large volumes of semi-digested food and energy-rich pro-ventricular (&#x2018;stomach&#x2019;) oil which is stored in their crop and slowly digested over many days.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/chatham-petrel-ranguru/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/chatham-petrel-ranguru/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.taiko.org.nz/\">http://www.taiko.org.nz</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Aikman, H.; Miskelly, C. 2004. <em>Birds of the Chatham Islands</em>.

They are commonly seen in large flocks off Little Barrier Island during the summer, and their calls are often heard at night during the spring and summer as birds cross over the Auckland isthmus and Northland after feeding in the Tasman Sea. They feed on small crustaceans,&#xA0;squid and fish, mostly picked off the ocean surface during long distance flights covering many thousands of kilometres. Cooks petrels have responded well to pest control on their main breeding islands and both populations are increasing rapidly.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Cook&#x2019;s petrel is a small grey-and-white gadfly petrel with narrow wings and a pointed tail in flight. It has a grey head with white-and-dark speckling on the forehead and crown. The upper surface is evenly grey contrasting with darker brown-black feathers running across the upper wings and rump in an M shape. The undersides are mostly white, with a thin dark patchy line on the leading edge of the outer underwing. The black bill is 25-30 mm long. The eye is dark, and the legs are dull blue-grey with yellowish webs and black margins.</p>\n<p>Voice: the calls of Cook&#x2019;s petrels are mainly goat-like bleatings (<em>kek-kek-kek </em>or <em>eh-eh-eh</em>) and lower pitched <em>boor</em> sounds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Pycroft&#x2019;s petrel is slightly smaller with darker-grey plumage above, and lacks the speckled feathers on the crown. Gould&#x2019;s petrel has a much darker head with an extensive dark cap, and a more extensive black leading edge on the underwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Cook&#x2019;s petrels formerly bred throughout both the North and South Islands, on mountain tops and ranges. &#xA0;After hundreds of years of predation by introduced mammals, they became confined to just three islands. In the north the largest colony is on Little Barrier Island, with a few on nearby Great Barrier Island. In southern New Zealand, Cook&#x2019;s petrels breed on Codfish Island off the coast of Stewart Island. They generally nest under tall forest. On Little Barrier Island, most burrows are found above 250 metres altitude or in pockets of mature vegetation below this height. On Codfish Island they breed at a range of altitudes down to near sea level, suggesting broad tolerance for breeding habitat. Cook&#x2019;s petrels nest in long twisting burrows amongst tree roots, under rocks or below fallen tree stumps, in sandy or peaty soils.</p>\n<p>Cook&#x2019;s petrels are specialist deep water (pelagic) foragers whose at-sea distribution during breeding is within deep oceanic waters of the Tasman Sea and western South Pacific from approximately 32&#xB0;S to the sub-tropical convergence zone. After breeding they migrate to the North Pacific transition and California Current system (northern populations), or to the Humboldt Current off Peru and Chile (Codfish population) to complete the annual feather moult.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Little Barrier Island holds the largest Cook&#x2019;s petrel population, estimated at 286,000 breeding pairs in 2007. The few pairs on Great Barrier Island are probably sustained through immigration from the nearby Little Barrier Island colony. The population on Codfish Island was estimated to be c.5000 breeding pairs in 2008, and has recovered significantly from possibly less than 50 breeding pairs in the 1980s.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Introduced predators are a major threat to Cook&#x2019;s petrels. Pacific rats were present at all of their breeding sites including the mainland but now only remain on Great Barrier Island. Additionally, there are ship rats, feral cats and feral pigs on Great Barrier Island. All introduced predators have been eradicated from Little Barrier and Codfish Islands. In high-altitude colonies on Little Barrier Island, rats took more than 90% of eggs and small chicks in some seasons. After rat eradication in 2006, the breeding success rate increased from 5% to 60%. On Codfish Island introduced weka almost extirpated the Cook&#x2019;s petrel population (estimated at 20,000 pairs in 1934). The colony has recovered following weka eradication in 1980, but is still less than a quarter of its original size. The risk to Cook&#x2019;s petrels from fisheries impacts appears to be minimal. Attempts to establish a Cook&#x2019;s petrel colony within a predator-exclusion fence on Cape Kidnappers, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, began with translocation of&#xA0;over 400&#xA0;chicks from Little Barrier Island &#xA0;in 2010-16. There is no evidence to date that this translocation has been successful.&#xA0;From 2013 the Department of Conservation has translocated chicks from Little Barrier Island to the Boundary Stream Mainland Island, also in Hawke&apos;s Bay.&#xA0;This project is ongoing.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The breeding season for Cook&#x2019;s petrel runs from September to April, with the northern population breeding one month earlier. [The dates given here are for the northern population.] Following a first burrow visit in September, birds depart on a pre-laying exodus of approximately 27 days. A single white egg (53 x 39 mm) is laid in November and hatches from December to January after 47 days of incubation. The well-lined nest chamber is at the back of a very long burrow that can run across the slope amongst tree roots. Most birds breed annually and the same pairs can breed together and rear many chicks over multiple years. Both adults share incubation shifts of about 14 days and share in the feeding of their chick. The chick is independent of the parents at fledging in March (c.88 days old); the parents leave on their migration approximately 10 days before the chick departs. Age of first return to colonies is unknown (probably c.3 years).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Cook&#x2019;s petrels are nocturnally active at breeding grounds, arriving about an hour after sunset. Their activity ashore peaks on dark nights or during periods of wet, stormy weather. On Little Barrier Island their calls can be almost deafening as thousands of birds descend upon the island after dark. However, very few birds call on the ground. Recent tracking studies show that Cook&#x2019;s petrels mostly forage at the sea surface, but can dive down to 20 m or more. They cover hundreds or even thousands of kilometres during single foraging trips.</p>\n<p>Comparison of the behaviour, ecology and genetics of the northern and southern Cook&#x2019;s petrel populations suggest that they should be considered as distinct subspecies.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Cook&#x2019;s petrels feed mainly on small squid, plus some fish and crustaceans. Chicks are fed an average of 37 g of food, with adult foraging trips averaging approximately 6 days and chicks thus being fed approximately every 3 days. The type of foods eaten suggests most of the feeding is done at night, although activity loggers showed that birds were also active by day during the breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook&apos;s_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook&apos;s_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3888\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3888</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cookspetrel.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cookspetrel.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/cooks-petrel/pterodroma-cookii/\">http://www.arkive.org/cooks-petrel/pterodroma-cookii/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bartle, J.A.; Hu, D.; Stahl, J-C.; Pyle, P.; Simons, T.R.; Woodby, D. 1993.

Among these specimens, Stejneger recognised 18 new species, including two petrels from Mutsu, at the northern tip of Honshu Island, Japan. He measured and described these accurately, naming them <em>Pterodroma longirostris</em>, noting that they had been likely driven ashore by a gale, and that they probably bred on some &#x201C;out-of-the-way islet&#x201D;. It took nearly 50 years before New Zealand ornithologist R.A. Falla became aware that they were migrants from Isla Alejandro Selkirk (Masafuera), on the other side of the Pacific.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Although this elegant little petrel is not easy to identify at sea or as a storm-killed bird, it is one of the most distinctive of the nine species of similar-sized small <em>Pterodroma </em>petrels. All are grey above and white below, with black-tipped tails. However, Stejneger&#x2019;s petrel has a distinctive dark crown and nape, accentuated by an extensive (23 mm) white forehead. A triangle of white extending towards the ear from the neck separates the dark cap from&#xA0;a partial&#xA0;dusky&#xA0;breast band. The underwing is white with a black bar extending a short distance from the carpal joint towards the mid wing base (this mark is present to some degree on all <em>Pterodroma</em> petrels with white underwings). The bill is slender, hooked and black; the eye is dark, and the legs and feet are pink with dark outer toes and webs.</p>\n<p>Voice: Stejneger&#x2019;s petrel are mostly silent at sea; in flight over the colony they give a rapid <em>ti-ti-ti</em>, similar to other small <em>Pterodroma </em>petrels.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Gould&#x2019;s petrel also has a dark head and nape, but its upperparts are darker and show less contrast with the black cap and nape. In Gould&apos;s petrel the dark cap is more extensive,&#xA0;the white forehead is only 12-13 mm in height, and&#xA0;the underwing bar is wider and longer. Pycroft&#x2019;s, Cook&#x2019;s and De Filippi&#x2019;s petrel have pale grey heads and necks; and collared, black-winged, Chatham Island and Bonin petrels have very prominent black underwing bars. [Note that De Filippi&#x2019;s petrel <em>Pt. defilippiana</em>, collared petrel <em>Pt. brevipes</em> and Bonin petrel <em>Pt. hypoleuca</em> are not yet known from New Zealand.]</p>\n<p>Exact measurements of wing, tail, bill length and, preferably tarsus and toe lengths are needed for identification of Stejneger&#x2019;s petrel corpses.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Stejneger&#x2019;s petrel breeds during October-April, and only on Isla Alejandro Selkirk (M&#xE1;s Afuera) in the Juan Fern&#xE1;ndez Islands, 850 km west of Valparaiso, Chile. The colonies are in fern forest above 850 m on steep, rugged mountain sides. In the southern summer birds at sea normally occur only in the Humboldt Current, although they disperse up to 2500 km southwest into the Southern Ocean in April, prior to migration. Stragglers (10 records, 13 birds), reach the North Island of New Zealand during the breeding season (November-January) and, more rarely, eastern Australia. Some of these were late-moulting - perhaps juveniles making a belated attempt to return to their breeding colony by a roundabout route. Scattered reports of this species in Hawaii and off California in the southern summer are thought to be juveniles, as many were in moult. After breeding, all birds migrate 16,000 km north-west across the Pacific towards their wintering grounds in the subtropical north-west Pacific off Japan. Here, they forage in the cold, productive waters of the Oyashio/Kuroshio Extension Current, which flows east from Japan to Hawaii. Many dally in Hawaiian waters en route, and some as far south as Tonga. Most adults moult between June and August in the north-west Pacific.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population of Stejneger&#x2019;s petrels is estimated at 655,000 birds, based on recorded densities at sea and the breeding estimates of Brooke (1987).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>There is extensive predation on breeding colony by cats, and probably rats.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Stejneger&#x2019;s petrels breed in burrows between 850 and 1100 m above sea level on Cerro de los Inocentes, Isla Alejandro Selkirk, in a mixed colony with Juan Fern&#xE1;ndez petrels. Laying and fledging periods have not been accurately determined. They most likely lay in November and fledge in April, judging from museum specimens.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>In the eastern tropical Pacific, Stejneger&#x2019;s petrels foraged solitarily, and by night. Diet diversity was high, but did not vary significantly with season or sex. Stejneger&#x2019;s petrels ate mostly fish (60%), with myctophids (which come to the surface at night) making up over 34% of the diet. Other frequent items were jellyfish.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3892\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3892</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bartle, J.A.; Hu, D.; Stahl, J.-C.; Pyle, P.; Simons, T.R.; Woodby, D. 1993.

They are a species that few people have seen as the birds breed on islands with restricted access and they forage far out at sea. They also look very similar to the more common Cook&#x2019;s petrel and are difficult to separate at sea. Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels feed on small crustaceans and squid, mostly picked off the ocean surface during long distance flights covering many thousands of kilometres. Before the 1990s, Pycroft&#x2019;s petrel was in decline due to Pacific rat predation of their eggs and chicks on their breeding grounds. However most of these island colonies have now been cleared of rats and the species is increasing in numbers, especially in the Mercury Island group.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Pycroft&#x2019;s petrel is a small grey-and-white gadfly petrel with narrow wings and a pointed tail in flight. It has a dark grey head with white-and-dark speckling on the forehead. The upper surface is grey contrasting with darker brown-black feathers running in a broad &#x2018;M&#x2019; across the upper wings and rump. The underside is mostly white but with a thin dark line on the leading edge of the outer under-wing. In the hand, the black bill (23-26 mm long, 9-11 mm deep) has a sharp hook. The legs are blue-grey with pink-mauve webs.</p>\n<p>Voice: The calls of Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels are similar to those of other closely related small gadfly petrels, including shrill whistles (<em>ti-ti-ti </em>or <em>zip-zip-zip</em>) and lower pitched calls (<em>boor </em>and<em> yap-yap</em> sounds).</p>\n<p>Similar species: the very similar Cook&#x2019;s petrel is slightly larger with paler grey plumage above and more speckled feathers on crown. Gould&#x2019;s petrel has a darker head forming an extensive dark cap, and a more extensive black leading edge on the under-wing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels breed in colonies on the Mercury, Hen and Chickens, Poor Knights and Ririwha Island groups off north-eastern New Zealand. From 2001-03, chicks were transferred to Cuvier Island to form a new colony there. They previously bred on Norfolk Island. They nest in burrows amongst tree roots or under rocks, usually avoiding dense clay soils. The breeding burrows are normally dug on well-drained slopes under tall forest of pohutukawa, mahoe or tawapou. Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels forage over warmer water north of the sub-tropical convergence zone, mainly over deep water beyond the continental shelf. After breeding they migrate to the tropical central Pacific to complete the annual feather moult.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are no robust estimates of population size from the breeding islands. The population on Red Mercury Island has increased rapidly after Pacific rats were eradicated in 1992, with an estimated 5000-10,000 pairs now present. This represents perhaps 75% of the world population. Smaller but probably increasing populations of hundreds and possibly thousands of pairs occur on Stanley, Double and Lady Alice Islands. The remaining islands probably support fewer than 100 pairs each but there are no monitoring data to track population changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The major threat to Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels, as it is for all gadfly petrels, is the introduction of mammalian predators on their breeding grounds. Pacific rats were present on most of the breeding sites and studies showed that most eggs and chicks were eaten by this rodent. After the rats were removed from the islands by aerial poisoning operations conducted by New Zealand Department of Conservation between 1991 and 2011, breeding success improved dramatically with more than 80% of pairs fledging chicks. Fire is also a threat to this seabird with the northern islands becoming very dry in late summer. The risk to Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels from fisheries impacts appears to be minimal.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The Pycroft&#x2019;s petrel breeding season is from October to April, with the single white egg (48 x 35 mm) laid in late November or early December and hatching in January. The egg is laid in a well-lined nest at the back of a burrow that can be quite short. Most birds breed annually and the same pairs can breed together and rear many chicks over multiple years. Both birds share incubation shifts and feeding of their chick. The chick is independent of the parents at fledging. The immature birds begin to return to colonies at 2-3 years of age and some start breeding the following season although others take 5-10 years to begin breeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels are nocturnally active at breeding grounds, arriving about an hour after sunset. Their activity ashore is more pronounced on dark nights (no moon) or during periods of wet, stormy weather. The birds can be quite noisy when flying over the islands and call repeatedly with many pairs engaged in aerial chases. Calling on the ground is less frequent and it is difficult to locate birds once they land. There is very little information known about their life at sea. Recent tracking studies show that the birds mostly forage at the sea surface, with only shallow dives recorded. Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels fly hundreds or even thousands of kilometres during single foraging trips.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Pycroft&#x2019;s petrels have been recorded feeding on crustaceans and small squid. Chicks are fed on average 34 g of food every second night, and there is a desertion period in the final week before fledging. There is no information on whether feeding occurs mainly by day or at night.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3889\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3889</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/petrelpycroft.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/petrelpycroft.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bartle, J.A. 1968.

There are two populations that cannot be distinguished at sea. The Australian population is smaller in numbers, but is increasing in response to conservation management. The New Caledonian population is large, but declining due to the impacts of introduced predators. Gould&#x2019;s petrels are regularly seen in the southern Tasman Sea during the summer breeding season, as far east as Fiordland and south to Antarctica. Tracking studies have revealed that the two subspecies use different migration routes and have non-breeding ranges in different areas of ocean. The Australian birds migrate to the central Pacific, south of Hawaii, while the New Caledonian birds migrate to the eastern Pacific, west of Ecuador.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Gould&apos;s petrel is a small gadfly petrel with a white face that contrasts with a prominent dark hood covering the crown, neck and sides of the cheeks to below the eyes. The pale grey mantle grades to darker grey on the rump, and the rounded tail has a brown wash. The upperwings are dark brown-grey with an indistinctive blackish elongated &#x2018;M&#x2019; extending across the back. The underparts are white, apart from a broad black margin to the underwing, with a dark diagonal bar running from the leading edge towards&#xA0;- but not reaching -&#xA0;the body. The slender, hooked bill is black, the eye is dark, and the legs and toes are pink with dark outer toes and webs. The sexes are similar and juveniles resemble adults. In flight, Gould&apos;s petrel recalls a small shearwater but with less fluttering and shallower flight peaks; it often adopts bat-like weaving flight and may rise high over the ocean.</p>\n<p>Voice: Gould&apos;s petrels in flight over the colony at night give a cicada-like <em>tit-tit-tit-tit</em>. On the ground or at the nest, they make squeaky high-pitched <em>pee-pee-pee-peeoo </em>sounds and low trembling growls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Gould&apos;s petrel has a broader dark leading margin to the underwing than other small &quot;Cookilaria&quot; gadfly petrel species (including Cook&apos;s, Pycroft&apos;s, Stejneger&apos;s, collared, black-winged). The species regularly present in New Zealand waters (Cook&apos;s, Pycroft&apos;s and black-winged petrels) all have paler grey heads. Stejneger&apos;s petrel is smaller with the dark &#x2018;hood&#x2019; reduced to more of a cap (with a broader white forehead, and a wedge of white below the ear, separating the cap from the dusky sides of the upper breast). The dark bar on the underwing is smaller and less prominent. Collared petrel has variable incomplete-to-complete breast-band, and is sometimes entirely dark-bellied. The palest collared petrels are very similar to Gould&#x2019;s petrels, though with the hood not as dark and extensive. Gould&apos;s petrels can have variable amounts of white on the face and forecrown.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The nominate form of Gould&apos;s petrel breeds on Cabbage Tree and three other small islands off Port Stephen, northern New South Wales. On Cabbage Tree Island, nesting is concentrated in two steep gullies with scree slopes and a canopy of cabbage tree palms and fig trees. Fallen palm fronds provide protection from the elements and conceal birds and burrows from predators. In New Caledonia, the form <em>caledonica</em> breeds in three colonies between Mts Dzumac and Poya, at 350-650 m above sea level. They may also breed in small colonies on Raivavae in the Austral Islands, and in Tahiti. During the breeding season, Gould&apos;s petrels are regularly seen in the Tasman Sea and as far south as the Antarctic coast. Outside the breeding season, they migrate east and north. Tracking studies show that the two subspecies use different migration routes and range over different parts of the Pacific Ocean when not breeding. The nominate subspecies migrates to the central Pacific south of Hawaii, and <em>caledonica </em>to the eastern Pacific west of Ecuador [D. Priddel in litt. 2012].</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population of Gould&apos;s petrel is estimated at 3,000-21,000 individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are more than 30 records of beach-wrecked Gould&#x2019;s petrels in New Zealand mainly from the west coast of the North Island, during November-June. All birds assessed have been of the New Caledonian form. New Zealand sight records include several birds seen at sea in waters west of Foveaux Strait and off the Fiordland coast, and off the Three Kings Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian population of Gould&#x2019; petrel has increased due to conservation actions, but the New Caledonian population is declining due to predation by introduced mammals. On Cabbage Tree Island, introduced rabbits have been eradicated, and birdlime trees removed to reduce entanglement. Successful translocation of nestlings to nearby Boondelbah Island was also carried out. On New Caledonia, introduced ship rats take eggs and chicks, feral pigs dig chicks from burrows, and feral cats are also a threat. The local government used to fund rat control near a large breeding colony, but this has been discontinued.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Gould&#x2019;s petrel is an annual breeder nesting in low-density colonies in rock crevices, hollows in fallen cabbage tree palms, and cavities in buttresses of trees on islands off New South Wales. In New Caledonia, they breed in small, loose colonies of 10-50 pairs in burrows on steep, forested slopes 350 to 650 m above sea level. Birds arrive on Cabbage Tree Island from mid September. The single white egg is laid from early November to mid-December. Incubation is shared and takes about 49 days. Chick stays in the nest for 13 weeks, growing up to 150% the weight of an adult bird before losing weight and fledging from late March to early May. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>After breeding, adults and juveniles migrate and spend the rest of the year at sea. Young non-breeding birds remain at sea for several years, returning to breed at 4-5 years old. Pairs return to the same site each year to breed. Banded adults have been recorded living over 40 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>During the breeding season, Gould&#x2019;s petrels feed mainly on squid, small fish and krill taken in the Tasman Sea and waters off southern Australia. They are occasionally recorded feeding in association with other seabirds, tuna and dolphins. Prey is picked up from on or near the sea surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3887\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3887</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bretagnolle, V.; Thomas, T. 1990.

Although rarely seen in New Zealand seas, large numbers occasionally wash up dead on New Zealand beaches in late winter and spring. A surprising number (13) were found oiled (dead) on Bay of Plenty beaches in October 2011 following the <em>C.V. Rena</em> stranding and oil spill, indicating that blue petrels do occur over inshore waters at times. Maybe the few pelagic seabird watching opportunities in New Zealand are simply at the wrong times and places to see this cryptically coloured seabird with its diagnostic white-tipped tail. It is the only member of the genus <em>Halobaena</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The blue petrel is a small seabird that combines features of prions and the smaller gadfly petrels (genus <em>Pterodoma</em>). Its overall colouration (grey-blue above and white below, including underwing) and flight behaviour are similar to prions, while its bill structure and head plumage are more like a small gadfly petrel (e.g. Gould&#x2019;s petrel). A conspicuous blackish cap extends to the eye and onto the sides of neck as a partial collar, contrasting with the white forehead and throat, and a curl of white extending up towards the ear. The dark cap blends into the grey-blue upperparts and upperwings. As for prions, a dark open &#x2018;M&#x2019; extends across the upperwing from wingtip to wingtip, broken only across the lower back. The tail is square with a unique white tip, readily seen at sea if the dorsal surface is seen. The underparts are white, apart from the dark half-collar. The bill is blackish, and the legs and feet blue with pink webs. Blue petrels mainly fly close to the sea surface; they soar more than most prions, but without the towering arcs of otherwise similar small gadfly petrels (the latter also have darker upperwings, with the &#x2018;M&#x2019; not as prominent).</p>\n<p>Voice: blue petrels are silent at sea, and give cooing and cackling calls similar to prions at breeding colonies at night.</p>\n<p>Similar species: blue petrels are generally similar to the more slender-billed of the prions (e.g. thin-billed prions, fairy prion) and smaller gadfly petrels (e.g. Cook&apos; petrel, Gould&apos;s petrel), but the white-tipped tail is completely diagnostic.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The blue petrel is a pelagic, circumpolar seabird of the deep south, common near the pack ice but ranging north to 40&#xB0; S. They mainly stay near breeding islands during the southern summer, but spread into the Pacific sector in winter and spring. Blue petrels nest in large colonies, burrowing into tussock-covered slopes on islands off southern Chile (Diego Ramirez and Cape Horn Islands) and on South Georgia, and Prince Edward, Crozet and Kerguelen Islands. Smaller numbers nest on Marion and Macquarie Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The global population of blue petrels numbers in the low millions. Major colonies include Diego Ramirez Islands (1,000,000 pairs), Kerguelen Island (100,000&#x2013;200,000 pairs), Prince Edward Island (100,000 pairs), South Georgia (70,000 pairs), and Crozet Islands (40,000&#x2013;180,000 pairs). Fewer than 1000 pairs on Macquarie Island. Blue petrels are mainly recorded beach-wrecked in New Zealand, especially during July-October: typically 10&#x2013;100 per annum, max 881 in 1984. There are 9 records of beach-wrecked blue petrels from the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Blue petrels are not globally threatened, but introduced cats and rats have devastated some colonies. Cats and ship rats (both since eradicated) confined blue petrels to coastal stacks on Macquarie Island, and ship rats exterminated the population on Possession Island, Crozet Islands. Feral cats (since eradicated) greatly reduced the population on Marion Island, and continue to impact the population on Kerguelen Island. The subantarctic skua and the closely related Chilean skua are the main natural predators.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The blue petrels is a colonial, monogamous burrow-nester. Both sexes incubate the single white egg for 45-49 days, and feed the chick by regurgitation. The chick fledges after 43-60 days. Laying occurs in October, hatching in December, and fledging in February.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The blue petrel is a pelagic seabird, only coming ashore to breed. At sea it often occurs in single species flocks or in mixed flocks&#xA0; with prions, especially thin-billed prions (Drake Passage), Antarctic prions (near South Georgia and southern Indian Ocean) and Salvin&#x2019;s prions (southern Indian Ocean). As typical for most small petrels, blue petrels are nocturnal at their breeding sites, nest in burrows in large colonies, are monogamous, and have shared care of the single egg and chick.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Blue petrels mainly eat crustaceans, also small fish and squid obtained by dipping while in flight, or while swimming. They will also dive. &#xA0;Blue petrels often associate with prions, and occasionally attend feeding whales. They usually show little interest in ships, but will fly alongside in the lee of larger vessels.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Petrel\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3913\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3913</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The largest penguin, they are the only bird that breeds in the depths of the Antarctic winter, and they can dive deeper (500 m) and survive longer without eating (4 months) than any other bird. Emperor penguins are also the only bird species that breeds on ice, and one of the few birds that doesn&#x2019;t build a nest &#x2013; the male balances the egg on top of his feet. When combined with their stunning good looks and ridiculously cute chicks, it is little wonder that emperor penguins command so much attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Emperor penguins are very large penguins that could only be confused with the related, smaller king penguin. They are dark silver-grey on the back, and white on the breast and belly. The diagnostic broad pale patch on the side of the neck is yellow in adults and dull white in juveniles. Adults have a black head and chin, while juveniles have a chin colour that may vary from white to dark grey. The slender, decurved bill has a pink stripe on the lower mandible (paler in juveniles). Recently fledged chicks are about half the size of adults.</p>\n<p>Voice: a powerful, klaxon-like bray.</p>\n<p>Similar species: king penguin is smaller and more brightly coloured, with a relatively longer bill. The pale neck patch is narrower (spoon-shaped) and dark orange in adults. When swimming, king penguins have smaller, brighter neck patches that do not reach the water, compared to the larger paler neck patch of the emperor penguin that extends to the water line.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Emperor penguins are characteristic and abundant denizens of the Antarctic pack-ice. The 46 known colonies are scattered around the entire Antarctic continent, with almost all colonies located on fast ice (sea ice attached to the land) close to permanent openings (polynyas) in the sea ice. These polynyas, maintained by winds or currents, allow breeding adults to access feeding grounds during incubation and chick-rearing, including when the sea ice is at its annual maximum extent. The world population was estimated at 595,000 breeding pairs in 2009.</p>\n<p>Adults are rarely seen beyond the pack-ice, which extends to about 60&#xB0; S at its maximum extent south of New Zealand. Juveniles tracked by satellite after leaving their natal colonies have been found to swim well north of the pack-ice, up to 54&#xB0; S. Vagrants have occurred up to 40-41&#xB0; S off Argentina and New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>The two New Zealand records are contrasting tales. A bird in adult plumage came ashore on Oreti Beach, Southland, on 5 April 1967, and was released without fanfare off Dog Island, Foveaux Strait, the following day. The second record was an immature bird ashore on Peka Peka Beach, Kapiti coast, 20-24 June 2011, before being taken into care following excessive consumption of sand. This bird became a media sensation (widely known as &#x2018;Happy Feet&#x2019;), and was eventually released north-east of Campbell Island on 4 September 2011.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The emperor penguin takes the generic penguin feed-and-fast lifestyle to extremes. They lay down extensive subdermal body fat, providing both insulation and energy reserves. This fat allows them to survive weeks or months without feeding during courting, incubation, chick care, moult, and the often lengthy transit between the sea and breeding colonies. As a result, the body weight of emperor penguins fluctuates greatly between about 23 and 45 kg. Males can lose up to 45% of their bodyweight during the 4 months that they are continuously at the colony from the start of courtship (March-April) through to after the egg hatches (July-August).</p>\n<p>The single large egg is incubated entirely by the male for 62-67 days, with the female returning to the sea for 2 months until soon after the egg hatches. The egg, and later the young chick, is balanced on its parents&#x2019; feet during brooding. This mobile &#x2018;nest&#x2019; allows the adults to move around, including forming their famous huddles during severe mid-winter blizzards. Both parents feed the chick through to fledging in December, timed to occur as the sea-ice breaks up in summer.</p>\n<p>Breeding adults moult in January-February, with juveniles and non-breeders moulting in November-December, either at colonies or elsewhere on Antarctic continent and sea ice. They first breed when about 5 years old, and have a life span of at least 20 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Emperor penguins mainly consume fish, also squid and krill, captured by pursuit diving. Dives are of up to 18 min duration, typically to depths of 50 metres, exceptionally to over 500 metres. Chicks are fed by regurgitation by both parents.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Penguin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Penguin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2011/06/23/the-global-penguin-part-1-how-a-lone-emperor-ventured-into-superstardom/\">http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2011/06/23/the-global-penguin-part-1-how-a-lone-emperor-ventured-into-superstardom/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Fretwell, P.T.; LaRue, M.A.; Morin, P.; Kooyman, G.L., Wienecke, B.; Ratcliffe, N.; Fox, A.J.; Fleming, A.H.; Porter, C.; Trathan, P.N. 2012.

The tall, colourful king penguin is one of the largest and most spectacular. It uses 36 cm flipper-like wings to swim, can dive more than 300 m below the surface to pursue prey, and can remain underwater for over 9 minutes. When ashore to breed, king penguins stand upright to walk on large, powerful&#xA0;webbed feet, and can toboggan on snow or ice by pushing forward with their feet and flipper-like wings and sliding on their bellies. They are highly social birds, gathering in huge colonies to breed on the coasts of subantarctic islands. They do not make a nest, instead laying a single greenish white egg which is incubated on the parents&apos; webbed feet and kept warm with a fold of skin. King penguins have the longest breeding cycle of any penguin species. Unable to fledge a chick within one year, they have evolved one of the strangest breeding cycles of any bird species. There are two egg-laying periods, which they alternate, allowing them to produce two young every three years.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>King penguins are slightly smaller and lighter than their southern relative, the emperor penguin, making them the second largest penguin species. Adults have bright golden-orange spoon-shaped head markings on both sides of the neck, grading to paler orange on the upper breast, fading to yellow, then white. The rest of the head, chin and throat are black with a greenish sheen, the back is silvery-grey, and the belly is satin white. The flipper-like wings (up to 36 cm long) and tail are black. The long, slender, black decurved bill has a prominent orange stripe along the lower mandible. The eye is dusky brown and the feet black. The sexes are alike, although females are slightly smaller. Chicks are black and almost naked at first, gradually growing brown down. These downy chicks are so different in appearance to adult birds that early European explorers described them as a separate species they named &apos;woolly penguin&apos;. Immature birds resemble adults, except the crown feathers are black with grey tips, the throat is greyish-white, the head markings are pale lemon yellow to white, and the bill has a pink to silvery white stripe along the lower mandible.</p>\n<p>Voice: the display song includes musical multi-note bugling. King penguns make brief contact notes at sea and soft cooing on land. Parents recognise chicks by their individually unique three-note whistle.</p>\n<p>Similar species: emperor penguin is larger and heavier, has a shorter bill, and lacks the orange flash at the top of the breast and the thin black line separating the neck from the back. At sea, immature king and emperor penguins can be confusing, but king penguins have pale yellow or whitish spoon-shaped patches on each side of the neck, while emperor penguins have a dark head with a white patch lower down each side of the neck.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>King penguins are circumpolar colonial breeders&#xA0;on subantarctic islands<strong>,</strong> including 70,000+ pairs&#xA0;on Australian-administered Macquarie Island south of New Zealand. They also breed&#xA0;on South Georgia and Falkland, Marion, Prince Edward, Crozet, Kerguelen, Heard and possibly Staten Islands. They have a more northerly distribution than emperor penguins, but the pelagic ranges of the two species may overlap off eastern South America. At sea, king penguins are mainly found in a band between 40&#xB0;S and 55&#xB0;S. Within the New Zealand region vagrants regularly reach Campbell Island, more rarely moulting at Auckland, Snares and Antipodes Islands in summer and autumn. Stragglers have been recorded on the New Zealand mainland at Stewart Island, Catlins coast, Barrytown, Moeraki and Timaru in the South Island, and Auckland Harbour. This last bird is likely to have been released from a ship.</p>\n<p>King penguin colonies are usually on flat beaches with no snow or ice, and normally with easy access to sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The world population of king penguins is estimated at 2.23 million pairs and is increasing.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>At Macquarie Island one colony was exterminated and another reduced to 5000 when king penguins were killed and rendered down for oil before 1920. The main threat today is changes in oceanic productivity near the breeding islands, associated with climate change. Research by a&#xA0; team at the University of Strasbourg found that warming of the sea surface by as little as several tenths of one degree poses a serious threat to king penguins. The study tracked more than 450 king penguins over nine years and found that warm events negatively affected breeding success and adult survival. The derived population dynamic model suggested a 9% decline in adult survival for 0.26&#xB0;C of warming. The authors suggested that king penguin populations were &quot;at heavy risk of extinction&quot; based on projections of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC predicted an average temperature increase of approximately 0.2&#xB0;C per decade for the next two decades.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Uniquely among bird species, king penguins breed twice every three years. Arrival times at colonies vary between September and November, and some birds are present at breeding colonies and nesting all year round. King penguins do not make a nest, instead laying a single, pale, greenish-white egg which is incubated on the parents&apos; webbed feet and kept warm with a fold of skin. Both parents share incubation and chick rearing. Elaborate courtship displays involve the male advertising with repeated calling, head-lifting postures, and holding out his flippers. If successful in attracting a female, both birds face each other, shaking their heads vigorously while calling. &#xA0;Laying of the single egg is spread between November and April, with peaks in mid-December and early February. Incubation is shared, and takes about 54 days. The chick is brooded by either parent for about 39 days after hatching. Chicks are then left alone and gather into creches for nine months or more until fledging. Adults do not guard creches.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>King penguins at their colonies are typically segregated, with breeding birds occupying different areas from non-breeding birds that are moulting or roosting. Adults and chicks are segregated in winter. King penguins feed in large groups near colonies&#xA0;during the&#xA0;breeding season. Offshore, they travel and rest in small groups of 5-20; they are often solitary when diving for food. King penguins are pelagic outside the breeding season. A layer of fat beneath the skin allows birds to conserve body heat and survive freezing temperatures. They also rely on this body fat during the annual moult, when they are unable to go to sea for more than 3 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>King penguins eat fish, squid and krill, for which they dive up to 100 times a day, mainly foraging near the ocean floor. Prey is caught by pursuit-diving, the birds swimming at up to 12 km/h, normally no deeper than 50 m. The deepest dive recorded was 343 metres and the longest dive, 9 minutes 20 seconds. Skuas, giant petrels, sheathbills and southern black-backed gulls take king penguin eggs, and harass and prey on chicks. Orca and leopard seals prey on adults at sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/7/2493.abstract\">http://www.pnas.org/content/105/7/2493.abstract</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3848\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3848</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996 (rev 2000). <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

They are abundant in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica, but are very rare vagrants to mainland New Zealand, with just two records. The world population is estimated at 10,000,000 birds, of which about 34% live in the Ross Sea sector.</p>\n<p>Adult Adelie penguins are readily recognised by their diagnostic white eye-ring and absence of other facial ornamentation, but the eye-ring can be absent in the white-chinned juveniles, which look quite different to the much photographed adults.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Adelie penguins are medium-sized, black-and-white penguins that are mainly confined to the sea-ice zone around Antarctica. Adults have a black head, face, chin and upper parts. They are distinguished from other penguins by a characteristic white eye-ring, and can also raise the feathers of the hind-crown, when displaying, to form a diagnostic angular occipital crest. Adelie penguins have a relatively long tail, and much of the bill is covered in feathering, making the exposed bill short and stumpy. Juveniles have dark blue back feathers when they leave the colonies, and further differ from adults in having the white eye-ring less prominent or absent, and having a prominent white chin, with a sharp demarcation line passing below the eye (cf. chinstrap penguin).</p>\n<p>Voice: Adelie penguin colonies are very noisy places. The main calls given by adults are a loud, throbbing bray <em>arr-rar-rar-rar-raah</em>, often followed by a reverberating <em>kug-gu-gu-gu-gaaaa</em>. The contact call given on land, ice and sea is sharp bark <em>aark</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: adult Adelie penguins are unmistakeable. White-chinned juveniles could be confused with chinstrap penguins (especially juveniles), which always have fully white cheeks, with the black-white demarcation line passing above the eye. </p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Adelie penguins have a circum-antarctic distribution, and are rarely recorded far from the Antarctic coast or sea-ice. They breed wherever ice-free Antarctic sites are accessible from the coast, often in close association with chinstrap or gentoo penguins, with each species typically having discrete colonies. Outside the breeding season, and even when moulting, Adelie penguins are mainly birds of the pack-ice zone, all around Antarctica.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The world population of Adelie penguins is estimated at 3.79 million pairs, around&#xA0;34% of which live in the Ross Dependency south of New Zealand. </p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The two New Zealand records were an adult corpse found north of the Flaxbourne River mouth, Marlborough (December 1962), and a live bird at Kaikoura in January 1993.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Several threats to Adelie penguins have been identified, including an increase in human visitors to Antarctica, resource extraction and installation of research stations on rare ice-free Antarctic sites used by penguins for nesting. Perhaps the greatest risk is the impact of climate change on the distribution of sea-ice around Antarctica, but the break-up of ice-shelves may expose further land suitable for breeding. Two recent studies reported decreases in the numbers of Adelie penguins breeding on the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands (32% decline between 1983-84 and 2004-05), while they are apparently increasing in the Ross Sea sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Adelie penguins breed in large colonies in the Antarctic. Around 34% of the population is found in the Ross Dependency (around 1,290,000 pairs), with 250,000 breeding pairs at Cape Adare and 170,000 at Cape Crozier. There birds arrive at colonies in September-October and lay 2 eggs in a small depression that is lined with pebbles, which they collect (or steal from&#xA0;neighbouring nests). The eggs hatch after 30 &#x2013; 43 days of shared incubation, after which chicks are brooded by a parent for about 2 weeks before joining together in cr&#xE8;ches after about 2 weeks. The first coat of down is pale gray, though much darker on the head, with the second down a darker brown. The young birds fledge at 50-56 days and are sexually mature around 8 years of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Adelie penguins are highly gregarious, often gathering in roosting flocks on sea-ice, as well as being colonial breeders. Like other penguins, Adelie penguins spend most of their life at sea, feeding on krill and small fish, which they catch by pursuit-diving. Although they normally fish at depths less than 40 m, dives of up to 175 m have been recorded. There is some evidence that Adelie penguins feed more at night, though there is perpetual daylight at the height of the breeding season. </p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Adelie penguins mainly eat krill (<em>Euphausia superba </em>and <em>E. crystallorophias</em>), although small quantities of fish, amphipods and cephalopods&#xA0;are also consumed.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C3%A9lie_Penguin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C3%A9lie_Penguin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/science/plants-animals-fungi/animals/birds/penguins\">http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/science/plants-animals-fungi/animals/birds/penguins</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Coria, N.R.; Montalti, D.; Rombola, E.F.; Santos, M.M.; Garica Beto&#xF1;o, M.I.; Juares, M.A. 2011.

A few hundred birds breed at the Balleny Islands in the Ross Dependency, which is possibly the source of the five birds recorded from New Zealand between 1978 and 2002.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Chinstrap penguins are medium-sized penguins, black above and white below. They are one of two predominantly white-faced penguins, with white extending above the eye.

Juvenile Adelie penguins have the black-white demarcation line passing below the eye, and so are darker on the face than chinstrap penguins.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Chinstrap penguins are marine animals that nest on ice-free rocky coasts, often together with Adelie penguins. The bulk of the chinstrap penguin population is based in the Scotia Sea, east of the Antarctic Peninsula, with large colonies on the South Sandwich Islands (c. 5,000,000 breeding pairs), and also on the nearby South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula to 65&#xB0; S. A few breed on South Georgia, Bouvet&#xF8;ya and Peter I &#xD8;y.

The population on the Balleny Islands has increased, up from the 13 pairs recorded on Chinstrap Island in the early 1980s.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There have been five sightings of single, healthy chinstrap penguins in New Zealand. The first was on Antipodes Island in November 1978, followed by&#xA0;one near Invercargill&#xA0;(December 1980), Campbell Island (March 1984), Warrington Spit, Otago (November 1992), and South Bay, Kaikoura (November 2002).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The chinstrap penguin is not globally threatened, and is apparently increasing as the Ad&#xE9;lie penguin declines on the northern Antarctic Peninsula. They also increased on the South Orkney Islands between 1983 and 2004.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Chinstrap penguins breed in huge colonies (sometimes hundreds of thousands of pairs), often adjacent to colonies of Ad&#xE9;lie penguins. They arrive at breeding sites in October-November and lay 2 eggs in a small depression that is lined with stones. The eggs are incubated by both the male and the female in stints of up to 6 days duration, hatching after about 37 days. The downy chicks are pale grey on the head and back, and off-white on the belly. They are brooded on the nest for about 3 weeks, after which they join a cr&#xE8;che. The young birds shed their down after about 50-60 days and head out to sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Chinstrap penguins are extremely gregarious at their breeding grounds, and often roost in flocks (sometimes with Ad&#xE9;lie penguins) on sea ice. Like other penguins, chinstrap penguins spend most of their life at sea, where they feed on krill and small fish. They are considered to be the most aggressive of all penguins. Chinstraps are often hunted by leopard seals, and orca have also been observed hunting and eating adult chinstrap penguins. Some chicks are taken by subantarctic and South Polar skuas.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chinstrap penguns feed almost exclusively on Antartic krill (<em>Euphausia superba</em>), along with some fish and other crustaceans.

They are the form of rockhopper penguin that inhabits the southern region of the Atlantic Ocean &#x2013; with a stronghold on the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) &#x2013; and southern Chile. On the Falkland Islands western rockhopper penguins have experienced a significant decline in population numbers, some 1.4 million pairs (87%) in the past 80 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The western rockhopper penguin is a small crested penguin that can be distinguished from related species by the form of its crests, and the absence of pale skin at the base of the bill. The head, face, back and tail are black or dark grey, with a blue sheen immediately after moulting, and dull brown cast just before. The underparts are white with a sharp demarcation to black at the throat. The crest starts as a narrow, sulphur-yellow stripe about 1-2 cm above the gape. This expands into a wedge or triangle in front of the eye (cf. thin and parallel in eastern rockhopper), extending back horizontally and spreading out into long, drooping yellow plumes behind the eyes. The dangling plumes reach to the vicinity of the black-white demarcation line on the throat (cf. Moseley&#x2019;s rockhopper penguin). The two yellow crests are joined across the hind-crown by a shorter, black occipital crest. The flippers are blue-black with a thin white trailing edge; the underside is white with a black tip and a thin grey leading edge. The orange-red bill is separated from the feathers by a thin strip of black skin. The eyes are bright red, and the feet and legs pink with black soles. Immature birds are generally smaller than adults and have a greyer throat and less well-developed crests.</p>\n<p>Voice: more rapid and harsh than in other crested penguins; described as &#x201C;shrill and unmusical&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Similar species: eastern rockhopper penguin has pink skin at the base of the bill, and the eye-brow stripe in front of the eye is narrower and parallel-sided (cf. wedge-shaped in western rockhopper). Moseley&#x2019;s rockhopper penguin also has black skin at the base of the bill, but as an adult has much more luxuriant, pendulous yellow crests that extend well below the black-white demarcation line on the throat.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The western rockhopper penguin inhabits the southern Atlantic Ocean and the vicinity of the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn. The main breeding colonies are on the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), and on islands off southern Chile. They disperse widely outside the breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Western rockhopper penguins have experienced a significant decline in population numbers on the Falkland Islands, by some 1.4 million pairs (87%) since 1932. The total population size is currently estimated to be c.775,000 breeding pairs, with an on-going decline suspected.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Recorded only from the Snares Islands, where a bird occupied an empty nest in a Snares crested penguin colony during the 1985-86 and 1986-87 penguin breeding seasons. At least two were present between November 1986 and March 1997, mainly among roosting Snares crested penguins on coastal rocks, with the last sighting of a single bird in February 2000. It is possible that all sightings were of the same two birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Commercial fisheries and oil exploitation have been identified as significant threats to western rockhopper penguin. Egg collection and predation by humans may still occur at some sites in southern Chile. Climate variation is suspected to have a significant impact on the productivity and prey abundance within the penguins&#x2019; main foraging regions, and is likely to be the underlying cause of the massive population decline recorded on the Falkland Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Adults arrive at their breeding colony in October-November with males returning about a week earlier than females. A small nest is built using vegetation, peat and pebbles. Two eggs are laid c.4 days apart. The first, smaller egg is usually lost during incubation, which is shared and takes about 34 days. The few chicks that hatch from first eggs usually die within the first few days of brooding. The remaining chick is guarded for up to 26 days after which the chicks form cr&#xE8;ches before fledging when c.70 days of age. </p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Western rockhopper penguins inhabit both pelagic and coastal zones and can forage as far south as the limit of the pack-ice in Antarctica. They pursue their prey to depths of 100 m and may range up to 300 km away from their colonies during the later stages of breeding. Their breeding colonies can be on level or gently sloping ground, to rock ledges below cliffs. On the Falkland Islands colonies are often associated with those of black-browed mollymawks (albatrosses) and imperial shags. Adults moult at their nest sites&#xA0;from late March onwards. Feathers are replaced within 20-25 days and the penguins leave on their non-breeding migration in mid-April. </p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Western rockhopper penguins feed predominantly on euphausiid crustaceans (&#x201C;krill&#x201D;), with fish and squid occurring more frequently in their diet towards the end of chick rearing.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rockhopper_Penguin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rockhopper_Penguin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22735250/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22735250/0</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Banks, J.C.; van Buren, A.; Cherel, Y.; Whitfield, J.B. 2006.

Recent research has suggested that the eastern rockhopper penguin is genetically distinct from two closely-related species: the western (or southern) rockhopper penguin, which breeds on islands around southern South America and the Falkland Islands, and Moseley&#x2019;s (or northern) rockhopper penguin, which breeds on a few&#xA0;temperate islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Taken together, rockhopper penguins have a broad circumpolar breeding distribution spanning 37-53&#xB0; latitude. Large-scale population declines of each species occurred at many breeding sites across their range in the 20th Century, perhaps accelerating in recent decades. A global population of more than 5.5 million breeding pairs of rockhopper penguins declined to less than 1.5 million, including a dramatic decline at New Zealand&#x2019;s Campbell Island.</p>\n<p>Breeding sites of the eastern rockhopper penguin in the New Zealand region include Campbell, Auckland, Antipodes and Macquarie islands or island-groups. Eastern rockhopper penguins visit land only to breed and moult during the austral spring, summer, and early autumn, spending the remaining 5-6 months of the year at sea. Adult eastern rockhopper penguins tracked from Campbell Island travelled south-east or east during the over-winter period. The average maximum distance from Campbell Island was c.2,000 km, while the greatest was c.4,000 km. Several individuals travelled a total of c.15,000 km.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Eastern rockhopper penguins are readily identified as a species of &#x2018;crested penguin&#x2019; (genus <em>Eudyptes</em>) by their spiky yellow crest feathers, black back, white front, and orange-brown bill. They are the smallest of the crested penguins. The yellow eye-brow stripe starts well back from the bill and is very thin until behind the eye, where it flares out as a crest that also includes long black feathers. Some crest feathers are pendulant, but barely reach as far as the black-white demarcation line on the throat (cf. Moseley&#x2019;s rockhopper penguin). The two yellow crests are joined across the hind-crown by a shorter black occipital crest. The bare skin around the base of the bill (the gape) is pinkish-white in eastern rockhopper penguins. Although the bill is typically mostly orange-brown, in adults of the New Zealand region up to 90% of the lower mandible may be white, and a small amount of the distal end of the upper mandible may also be white. The eyes are red and the feet and legs are pinkish-white with black soles. Males and females differ primarily in bill size. Adult plumage is attained at 2 years of age. Fledglings (c.65 days old) are bluish black where they will later be black, and have a black bill and no obvious crest. In juvenile plumage (1-2 years of age), black parts may appear dark brown, the throat is mottled grey, the bill is smaller (mostly shallower) and more brown than orange, and the yellow crest feathers are short.</p>\n<p>Voice: breeding adults make loud pulsing, braying calls often accompanied by ritualised displays. A short contact bark is given on land and at sea.</p>\n<p>Similar species: within the New Zealand region, eastern rockhopper penguins are most similar to Snares crested penguin, which is larger with a more massive bill, duller red-brown eyes, and has broader eye-brow stripes that start closer to the bill. The Snares crested penguin also lacks an occipital crest. Western rockhopper penguin and Moseley&#x2019;s rockhopper penguin are very rare vagrants to the region. The western rockhopper has black skin around the base of the bill, and the yellow over the eye is wedge-shaped or triangular (cf. thin and parallel-sided in eastern rockhopper). Adult Moseley&#x2019;s rockhopper penguins have improbably long and luxuriant pendulant yellow crest feathers that reach well below the black-white demarcation line on the throat.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Within the New Zealand region, eastern rockhopper penguins breed at Campbell, Auckland and Antipodes Islands, and nearby Macquarie Island. Elsewhere they breed on Heard, Kerguelen, Crozet, Marion and Prince Edward Islands (all in the southern Indian Ocean). They breed in colonies of tens to tens-of-thousands of nests, reaching densities of 2.4 nests per m2 on open ground. Colonies are often on steep slopes near the sea, with nests often among and under boulders below eroding cliffs. Nest may also be in caves and up to 200 m inland and 100 m above sea level. Nests are composed of pebbles, sometimes lined with vegetation. Where colonies form amongst vegetation such as tussock, fern, or mega-herbs, the penguin&#x2019;s guano and trampling usually kills the plants and causes soil erosion down to bare rock over a decade or two. On Antipodes Island eastern rockhopper penguins mainly nest on the inland edges of colonies of the larger erect-crested penguin.</p>\n<p>There are&#xA0;very few confirmed records from the New Zealand mainland, as&#xA0;few of the reported sightings clarified which of the three forms (now species) of rockhopper penguin the bird belonged to. The only confirmed record since the 1970s was an immature bird that moulted at Cape Palliser, Wairarapa, in January-February 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Campbell Island formerly held the world&#x2019;s largest population of eastern rockhopper penguins, but the population crashed by an estimated 95% between 1942 and 2012, from 800,000 to 33,200 breeding pairs. Although inter-colony trends varied greatly, the overall Cambpell Island population grew between c.1996 and 2012. In the 20th Century the population at the Antipodes Island was likely considerably larger than at the Auckland Islands, but both have experienced major declines in recent decades and both now apparently support&#xA0;fewer than 3,000 breeding pairs. In 2011 the Antipodes Island population was estimated to be c.2,900 breeding pairs. Population estimates at Macquarie Island have varied greatly over short time periods, but a large decline seems apparent there too, with a 2007 population estimate of c.37,500 breeding pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Low food availability, resulting from climate change, is thought to be the main cause of eastern rockhopper penguin population declines. This is likely to be due to changes in oceanic productivity near breeding islands requiring adults to swim further offshore, spend more time foraging, or return with smaller food loads when provisioning young. Adults that are experiencing nutritional stress related to low food availability make longer foraging trips, and chicks that are fed less often grow more slowly. Predation by sea lions, fur seals, skuas, and giant petrels may have important impacts on some populations. On Campbell Island, predation by New Zealand sea lions of adult eastern rockhopper penguins is the most important driver of the ongoing decline of the main study colony. Oil spills pose a looming threat, especially if attempts are made to extract oil from seas south of New Zealand. Competition with commercial fisheries is a potential threat, but detailed data on diet and foraging distribution is lacking.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Eastern rockhopper penguins are monogomous, with shared incubation and chick care. They lay a 2-egg clutch with no re-laying or double-brooding. Eggs are laid about 4-5 days apart. Proper incubation does not begin until after the second egg is laid. The first laid (A-)egg averages only 72% the mass of the second-laid (B-)egg. Fledging of 2 chicks is&#xA0;rare (&lt;4% of nests). Typically only the chick from the larger, slightly earlier-hatching B-egg survives to fledge. Males return to breeding colonies in the first-half of October, females about a week later. Males and females fast ashore until their incubation foraging trip, averaging 36 days and 44 days after arrival, respectively. They lay mainly in the first-half of November, 12-21 days after females return. The first incubation shift of 7-10 days is shared, after which the female performs the second (14-17 days), and the male the third (7-9 days). Incubation periods average 33.5 days for B-eggs, and 39 days for A-eggs. Males continue their c.34 day fast while guarding their chick, females provisioning the chick daily. The downy chicks (brown, with off-white bellies) form cr&#xEA;ches when about 24 days old, and both sexes make daily, or less often multi-day, provisioning trips until the chick fledges at around 65 days old. When food is abundant a parent may provision chicks twice in the same day, especially if both chicks are alive. The majority of males make a 7-11 day self-feeding trip when chicks cr&#xEA;che before beginning provisioning. Sub-adult penguins may return to colonies to prospect in mid-December and come ashore again in mid- to-late January to moult on the periphery of colonies. Adults return to breeding colonies about a month after chicks fledge, and&#xA0;moult over 3-4 weeks in April.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Eastern rockhopper penguins are migratory, offshore-foragers. They are thought to feed mainly more than 10 km offshore from breeding colonies , but this has yet to be studied in detail.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Small fish, squid, octopus, and krill-like crustaceans were found in diet samples from adult eastern rockhopper penguins collected during the chick-rearing period on Campbell Island. Other populations may eat a greater proportion of crustaceans. In 1985&#x2013;1986, Campbell Island chick diet samples were dominated by a single fish species, southern blue whiting (<em>Micromesisteus australis</em>)(75.6 % by number of prey). </p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=32472\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=32472</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/southern-rockhopper-penguin/eudyptes-chrysocome/\">http://www.arkive.org/southern-rockhopper-penguin/eudyptes-chrysocome/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.globalpenguinsociety.org/species.html\">http://www.globalpenguinsociety.org/species.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.penguinworld.com/types/rockhopper.html\">http://www.penguinworld.com/types/rockhopper.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rockhopper_Penguin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Rockhopper_Penguin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/s/southern-rockhopper-penguin/\">http://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/s/southern-rockhopper-penguin/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66971\">http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66971</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/penguins/southern-rockhopper-penguins\">http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/penguins/southern-rockhopper-penguins</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.falklandsconservation.com/wildlife/penguins/rockhopper\">http://www.falklandsconservation.com/wildlife/penguins/rockhopper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niwa.co.nz/news/penguin-census-reveals-drop-in-numbers\">https://www.niwa.co.nz/news/penguin-census-reveals-drop-in-numbers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niwa.co.nz/news/penguins-reveal-unknown-swimming-talents\">https://www.niwa.co.nz/news/penguins-reveal-unknown-swimming-talents</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>BirdLife International. 2012.

Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguin is one of eight species of crested penguins, all of which occur in the New Zealand region as either breeders or vagrants. Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguin has the most spectacular crests of all, with improbably long yellow crest feathers reaching from behind the eye down to the upper breast. They are classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List due to very rapid population declines over the last three generations (30 years), throughout its range. Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguin can dive down up to 100 metres depth to pursue prey, and can remain submerged for over 2 minutes. When ashore, it stands upright to walk and hop on powerful pink webbed feet. Highly social birds, they gather in large colonies to breed on the coasts of subantarctic islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Adults are medium-sized, stocky black-and-white penguins with multiple long golden-yellow crest tassels growing above each eye and spiky black feathers across the back of the head. They have a narrow golden-yellow stripe above each eye, chunky reddish-brown bills and brilliant red eyes. The head, flipper-like wings, back, and tail are slate-grey to black; the underparts and &apos;trousers&apos; are white. Their feet are pink and their flipper-like wings grow up to 19 cm long. The sexes look alike but males are heavier with larger bills. Juveniles lack the elongated crests of adults.</p>\n<p>Voice: the adult repertoire includes noisy aggressive squawks and raucous braying and trumpeting that varies between individual birds. Adults recognise chicks by their individual &quot;<em>cheep</em>&quot; calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguins are slightly larger than&#xA0;eastern and western&#xA0;rockhopper penguins, and have much more luxurious and longer crest tassels. No other crested penguin has crest plumes that reach well below the black-white demarcation line on the throat.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguins inhabit the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans where they have a restricted breeding range, occurring at just seven subantarctic islands with a total land area of 250 km2. Most breed at Gough Island and islands in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago (UK), the rest breeding at Amsterdam and St Paul Islands (France). They are thought to disperse to seas north of their breeding islands outside the breeding season, but their precise movements are poorly known. Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguins have been recorded from the coasts of South America, South Africa and Australia in winter, and at least three birds have reached New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The latest global population estimate is c.270,000 pairs. Latest estimates for Gough Island and the Tristan da Cunha archipelago are 83,000 pairs at Middle Island (2009), 64,700 pairs at Gough (2006), 25,000 pairs at Nightingale (2009), 54,000 pairs at Inaccessible (2009) and 6,700 pairs at Tristan (2009). In the southern Indian Ocean there is an estimated 24,890 pairs at Amsterdam Island and 9,023 pairs at St Paul Island (France). At Gough Island the population declined by c.2 million pairs (98%) between 1955 and 2006, and at Tristan da Cunha by hundreds of thousands of pairs in the 1870s, reducing the population to around 5,000 pairs by 1955. Breeding colonies at Amsterdam and St Paul islands have declined by 40%. Population modelling indicates that over the previous 37 years (3 generations) numbers declined by 57% .</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>A single Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguin built a nest on Rangatira Island, Chatham Islands in August 1968, and was present at the same site in November 1970. A second bird reached the Chatham Islands in February 1993 (Pitt Island); what was presumed to be the same bird was seen at several sites on Pitt Island and nearby Star Keys at least once per year through to at least January 2004. The only other accepted record from New Zealand was a bird that came ashore to moult at Moa Point, Wellington in January 1984.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The IUCN Red List classifies the northern rockhopper penguin (=Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguin) as Endangered (A2) due to very rapid population declines over the last three generations (30 years), throughout its range. The exact causes of decline are poorly known, but changes in sea temperature, competition for food, incidental capture and drowning in commercial fisheries, and predation by introduced predators are implicated. For example, commercial fisheries and egg collecting are known to have caused significant mortality. In 2011, the cargo carrier <em>M.S. Oliva</em> ran aground on Nightingale Island, spilling oil that reached nearby Inaccessible Island, and also Tristan da Cunha Island over 30 km away. Thousands of penguins were oiled, resulting in 3,000 being removed from the wild for hand cleaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguin is a colonial breeder at temperate islands in the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans, where breeding adults arrive between July and August. Colonies are located in a variety of coastal habitats including open boulder beaches on Gough Island, and tussock-covered slopes on Nightingale and Inaccessible islands. Indian Ocean yellow-nosed mollymawks are present within colonies at Amsterdam Island. Noisy courtship displays involves much trumpeting, squealing, barking and &apos;quivering&apos; calls, accompanied by head-nodding and bowing. Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguins are monogamous, with pair-bonds maintained over successive seasons if both birds are present at the colony. The nest is a scrape on the ground usually lined with small pebbles, sometimes grasses. Two greenish-blue eggs are laid, the second larger than the first. Incubation is shared (though the female does more) and takes 33-34 days. Both parents care for the chick until it goes to sea when 9-10 weeks old, with the male doing most of the chick-brooding and guarding. A maximum of one chick is raised per breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Adults are present at breeding colonies July-March, then are at sea continuously after completing their annual moult. They are gregarious at sea, where birds feed in flocks. Birds often rest and preen after coming ashore, close to landing sites. Adult birds peck and use their flipper-like wings to strike at intruder birds in the colony, sometimes jabbing at them with an open bill and grappling their nape. Non-breeders roost at margins of colonies, breeders roost and moult at nest sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Moseley&apos;s rockhopper penguins feed on krill, squid, octopus and fish. Skuas and giant petrels prey on chicks and sick or injured adults. Subantarctic fur seals and leopard seals sometimes take adults coming ashore at colonies.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=32304\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=32304</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/community/2012/02/first-assessment-of-endangered-northern-rockhopper-penguins-since-2011-oil-spill/\">http://www.birdlife.org/community/2012/02/first-assessment-of-endangered...</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>BirdLife International. 2010.

They can be seen and heard on landing beaches during July &#x2013; December. Populations have declined considerably in range and numbers since human arrival. Immediate threats include fisheries bycatch, introduced predators, and human disturbance.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Adult Fiordland crested penguins have dark blue-grey/black upperparts (which turn brown when approaching moult), often darker on the head. A broad yellow eyebrow stripe (crest) starts at the nostril and extends well past the eye, drooping down the neck; 3-6 whitish stripes on the cheeks are displayed when agitated. The underparts are silky white. The moderately large orange bill has a thin strip of black skin at the base (cf. broader bare pink skin on Snares crested penguin). Females have smaller bills (bill depth &lt; 24 mm) than males (bill depth &gt;24 mm). The eyes are brownish-red, and feet and legs pinkish-white above and blackish-brown behind and on the soles. Juveniles have short, thin pale-yellow eyebrow stripes and mottled whitish chin and throat. The dorsal plumage of newly-fledged chicks is distinctly bluish, fading to black with wear, then to mid-brown before moulting.</p>\n<p>Voice: calls include loud braying or trumpeting, high pitched contact calls, and low-pitched hissing and growling. Calls are similar to those of Snares crested penguins.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Fiordland crested penguins are most similar to Snares crested penguin, which (as adults) have dark cheeks, a larger bill with prominent pink skin at the base, and narrower eye-brow stripes. All other crested penguins are also similar, especially when immature, but note broad eye-brow stripes, throat and cheeks greyish white, and absence of bare skin at bill base in immature Fiordland crested penguins. Recently fledged young (which are smaller than adults and bluish dorsally) may be confused with little penguins when swimming, but are twice as large&#xA0;and have at least some yellow above the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fiordland crested penguins breed patchily in South Westland (including Bruce Bay and Open Bay Islands), many sites in Fiordland, Solander Island, Codfish and Stewart Island and outliers. Historic accounts and fossil records suggest they were more widespread in the past, ranging up to the southern North Island and probably common in parts of the northern South Island. At-sea distribution is unknown. A few birds regularly reach the Snares Islands and all South Island coasts north to Wellington and west to Tasmania. Vagrants reach as far as north as Northland and Hawke Bay, west to Victoria (Australia), and south to Auckland, Campbell and Macquarie Islands. Surprisingly, there are no records from the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p>Fiordland crested penguin nesting habitat is diverse, ranging from mature temperate rain forest or dense coastal shrub, to sea caves and under rock boulders. They prefer hollows under fallen trees, roots, boulders or rock crevices.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Historic population accounts suggest Fiordland crested penguins have declined considerably in range and numbers. The current population&#xA0;trend is unclear, but probably declining. In the 1990s a series of surveys was attempted over their entire range. A total of 2,260 nests was found, however, numbers&#xA0;should&#xA0;be considered a minimum and a substantial undercount of actual number of breeding pairs is likely.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>At sea, Fiordland crested penguins are at risk from fisheries bycatch, particularly setnets and inshore trawl nets, with a bycatch rate of 38-176 birds per year estimated in 2011. Oil spills pose a potential extreme risk to Fiordland crested penguin if they occur near breeding colonies between June and March.</p>\n<p>Introduced predators (especially stoats) are the main land-based threat. When breeding or moulting near road access, dogs and road kill pose a high risk. Fiordland crested penguins are sensitive to human disturbance particularly at breeding and moulting sites. Disturbance can cause penguins to flee, facilitating nest predation and may cause starvation in moulting penguins. Human presence on landing sites may result in lower fledgling weights and reduced first year survival.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Fiordland crested penguins nest in loose colonies (nests 1-3+m apart), often in remote, difficult-to-access habitat. The 2 eggs are laid about 3-6 days apart in July-August, with the first (A-) egg being smaller than the second (B-) egg. Fiordland crested penguins typically raise one chick only despite laying two eggs. However, during favourable years, two chicks have been raised successfully in up to 12% of breeding pairs. Incubation commences when the second egg is laid. Both sexes share incubation duties for 5-10 days, after which first the female then the male leave the colony for a&#xA0;10-14 day&#xA0;foraging trip. By the time males depart after courtship followed by their first long incubation shift they have fasted for about 6 weeks. The eggs hatch in September after 31-36 days of incubation, with the larger B-egg hatching first. Chicks are guarded by the male and fed by the female for the first 3 weeks, then are left unattended and typically form small cr&#xE8;ches. Both parents continue to feed the chick(s) until they fledge at c.75 days-old in late November or early December.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Following breeding, the adults leave for 60-80 days to fatten up for the annual moult. Successful breeders return to their colonies in late January or early February, at which time they weigh about 2 kg more than at the end of the breeding season. Juveniles and non-breeders moult about one month earlier. During moult (about 3 weeks) they use up almost half their body weight while growing new feathers. Around late February or early March most penguins depart to sea, not returning to the colony until late June or early July.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Little is known about the marine ecology of Fiordland crested penguins. Prey composition varied considerably between northern Fiordland and Codfish Island, and consisted of cephalopods, crustaceans, and fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/penguins/fiordland-crested-penguin-tawaki/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/penguins/fiordland-crested-penguin-tawaki/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/fcpenguin.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/fcpenguin.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tawaki-project.org/\">http://www.tawaki-project.org/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tawaki-project.org/download/\">http://www.tawaki-project.org/download/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2000. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The Snares crested penguin has the most restricted breeding distribution of all the crested penguin species, being endemic to the 300 ha Snares Islands group. Moulting birds may occur on any of the subantarctic islands and north to Cook Strait. It is sometimes considered conspecific with the Fiordland crested penguin. However, despite 20-30 of the latter visiting the Snares Islands each breeding season, the two species have never been found interbreeding.</p>\n<p>An enduring mystery of the Snares crested penguin is why birds in the tiny population on the Western Chain islets, 3 km south-west of the main islands, breed 6 weeks later than the birds on North East and Broughton Islands. Are these birds reproductively isolated, and therefore a cryptic species?</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Snares crested penguin is a medium-sized crested penguin, about three times larger than the familiar little penguin. It has a black back, face and throat, sharply demarcated from white underparts. The robust orange bill has prominent pink skin around the base. Thin yellow eyebrow stripes start near the nostrils and spread into crests behind the red-brown eyes. From the front, the two crests spread out as a &#x2018;V&#x2019;. Immature birds have smaller bills and crests.</p>\n<p>Voice: a very loud, pulsing bray.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Fiordland crested penguin has a smaller bill, lacking bare skin at the base. It typically has broader stripes above the eye, and the pale bases to the cheek feather often show as whitish stripes on the cheek. Immature Fiordland crested penguins usually have whitish cheeks. Erect-crested penguins have crests starting nearer the corner of the mouth and rising obliquely over the eyes. From the front, the crests of erect-crested penguins appear more parallel than the splayed crests of other crested penguins. From the side, erect-crested penguins have a relatively large chin and a domed crown. The three rockhopper penguin species are smaller than Snares crested penguin, with redder eyes and more flared crests incorporating more black feathers.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Snares crested penguins are seabirds that only come to land to breed and moult. During the breeding season, adults forage around and north of the Snares Islands and up to 200 km to the east. Birds tracked through the winter mainly headed west to waters south of Tasmania, with a few birds travelling as far as south of the Australian Bight, north to waters off Westland, and into the southern Tasman Sea. On the Snares Islands, penguins land at 12 sites on the east coasts of the two main islands, and walk up to 900 metres inland to about 150 separate colonies. Most colonies are under <em>Olearia</em> forest or among&#xA0;<em>Veronica</em> shrubland, but a few are on exposed rocky sites. The birds on the Western Chain nest at lower density among boulders and mollymawk nests.</p>\n<p>Vagrant birds, mainly moulting during January-March, have been recorded from Chatham, Solander, Antipodes, Auckland, Campbell and Macquarie Islands, and from scattered sites around the South Island and Stewart Island (especially Otago, Banks and Kaikoura Peninsulas). There are single records from Wellington and Hawke Bay, and Snares crested penguins have also been recorded from Tasmania, South Australia and the Falkland Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Snares crested penguins are endemic to the Snares Islands. About 30,000 pairs breed on North East and Broughton Islands, and a few hundred pairs on Toru and Rima Islets in the Western Chain. Colonies on the two main islands range in size from 3-1300 pairs (average 200 pairs). Snares crested penguins are unusual among crested penguins in that their population is apparently stable, while six of the seven other crested penguin species have declined over the last 30-100 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>No threats are known, and the breeding islands are all free of introduced predators. However, the main prey species (arrow squid, red bait, and red cod) are all commercially harvested, and so there is potential for interactions with fisheries. In 2008-09, 23.2 tons of arrow squid were caught in the vicinity of the Snares Islands.</p>\n<p>Natural predators include New Zealand sea lion, New Zealand fur seal and leopard seal (the latter vagrant at the Snares Island, but they consume many penguins when present). Subantarctic skuas and red-billed gulls take many eggs and young chicks, but have little effect on productivity as few pairs are capable of raising both chicks. Northern giant petrels take some fledglings when they first go to sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The following summary is for birds on the two main islands. Breeding on the Western Chain islets occurs 6 weeks later. Adults return to colonies in September and lay mid September &#x2013; mid October. The second egg is significantly larger than the first. Both adults share incubation and care of the young. About 60% of pairs hatch both eggs (late October &#x2013; early November), but in almost all cases, only one chick survives more than 9 days. Chicks are guarded for c.3 weeks, then form cr&#xE8;ches for about 6 weeks before departing the island in late January.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Snares crested penguins are colonial breeders, and typically forage in small flocks when close to the breeding islands. Adults moult at breeding colonies in March and April. Non-breeders (mainly young birds) moult predominantly on coastal rocks above landing sites or on the margins of colonies, in January-March. Each bird stays ashore for the 3-4 weeks required to complete moult. They first breed when c. 6 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chicks are reared predominantly on small crustaceans (especially <em>Nyctiphanes</em> krill), with fish making up 30% of the diet (principally Hector&#x2019;s lanternfish <em>Lampanyctodes hectoris</em> and long-snouted pipefish <em>Leptonotus morae</em>), and squid 10% (mainly arrow squid <em>Nototodarus sloanii</em>). Adults feed primarily on pelagic fish (mainly juvenile redbait <em>Emmelichthys nitidus</em> and red cod <em>Pseudophycis bacchus</em>) and squid species (mainly arrow squid, warty squid <em>Morotheutis ingens</em> and violet squid <em>Histiotheuthis atlantica</em>). Other fish and squid species and pelagic octopi are taken in smaller quantities. Food is obtained by pursuit diving at depths up to 120 metres (typically 15-80 metres).</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snares_Penguin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snares_Penguin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.niwa.co.nz/news/penguins-reveal-unknown-swimming-talents\">https://www.niwa.co.nz/news/penguins-reveal-unknown-swimming-talents</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Demongin, L.; Poisbleau, M.; Strange, G.; Strange, I. 2010.

Otherwise quiet in flight and at sea.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: South Polar skuas (which migrates through New Zealand region) are slightly smaller and usually paler, but separation of the two species is difficult with dark morph South Polar skuas. Juvenile southern black-backed gulls are slighter, have narrower wings lacking a white outerwing patch, and are less powerful flyers. Pomarine and Arctic skuas are much smaller birds, with narrower wings and more elongated bodies and tails, compared to the large, chunky-looking subantarctic skua.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Subantarctic skuas are encountered at sea anywhere around New Zealand when migrating. A few may still breed in southern Fiordland and on Stewart Island, but their main breeding grounds are on the Chatham Islands, islands around Stewart, Solander Islands, and the subantarctic Snares, Antipodes, Auckland, Campbell and Macquarie Island groups. Subantarctic skuas have also been seen in the northern Ross Sea of Antarctica at the Balleny Islands and at Scott Island, although breeding has not been confirmed at either. Elsewhere, the same form of subantarctic skua breeds on many other subantarctic island groups in the southern Indian Ocean,&#xA0;plus South Georgia and islands between there and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Related forms occur further north on the Falkland Islands, Tristan da Cunha and Gough Islands, and in Patagonia and Chile.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When breeding, subantarctic skuas are found close to the coast, generally on exposed headlands and in areas of low vegetation. They are often associated with colonies or concentrations of prey species (penguins, prions, shearwaters) or large seal colonies that are a source of carrion. Non-breeding and &#x2018;off-duty&#x2019; skuas aggregate at non-territorial &#x2018;clubs&#x2019; in open ground, often near a water source.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No recent or overall data available, but likely 500-1000 breeding pairs, trios or groups in the New Zealand region. The Chatham, Snares and Stewart Island populations often breed in trios or larger groups, but co-operative breeding is rarely reported from the more southerly subantarctic islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At sea, possible risk of fisheries &#x2018;by-catch&#x2019;, particularly in areas beyond New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone where &#x2018;pirate&#x2019; fishing may occur without mitigation techniques. In the Chatham Islands and at locations around Stewart Island they are at risk from farmers shooting skuas that they believe are a problem for stock. Overall, the greatest threat for skuas is likely environmental impact of climate change on marine productivity near breeding islands affecting prey populations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the more southerly New Zealand subantarctic islands, subantarctic skuas are monogamous, with shared incubation, brooding, chick-feeding and defence. In the Chathams, Snares and islands around Stewart 30-50% of breeding territories are occuppied by trios and larger breeding groups. Trios are comprised of one female and two males. Pairs and trios have comparable breeding success, with larger groups much less successful. However, breeding pairs, trios and groups persist on territories for comparable periods (many years). Nests are scrapes, bare or lined with mosses or grasses. Clutch size typically 2 (rarely 3 and these more likely with trios or groups &#x2013; generally all fail), eggs large, stone-brown and heavily marked. Eggs are laid September&#x2013;December, and incubation takes 28-32 days. Chicks fledge at 55-60 days; at the Chatham Islands post-fledging care is evident.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Subantarctic skuas in the New Zealand subantarctic, like skua populations elsewhere, are present on their breeding grounds only during the summer, because their prey largely depart for a pelagic existence during the severe winters. Their behaviour and ecology are therefore necessarily &#x2018;pulsed&#x2019; with the seasons. Territorial behaviour, including the fierce defence of areas, seeks to maximise feeding and breeding prospects through exclusion of other skuas. Further north, around Stewart, the Snares and the Chathams, conditions are less severe (and in the last there are human-introduced food sources too). Here the skuas can remain for most of the year, and we see the high incidence of communal breeding. This may be a consequence of territories being maintained year-round, not just seasonally.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At sea, subantarctic skuas feed opportunistically on prey and debris on or just below sea-surface, but also force albatross and petrels to disgorge by high speed pursuit and strikes from above. During the breeding season, subantarctic skuas generally specialise on one or a few avian prey species &#x2013; variously penguins (eggs and chicks rather than adults), adults and fledgling petrels (particularly prions, storm petrels, diving petrels) and opportunistically other birds up to and including southern black-backed gulls. Some associate with seal or sea lion colonies, feeding on dead pups, placentas, regurgitations and faeces. Birds in non-migratory populations feed on goose barnacles and other marine invertebrates, when vertebrate prey are scarce or absent..</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/gulls-terns-and-skuas/7\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/gulls-terns-and-skuas/7</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Skua\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Skua</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Hemmings, A.D. 1994.

It breeds south of 60&#xB0; in Antarctica, including the Ross Sea region, which as the Ross Dependency is territory claimed by New Zealand. The first specimen was collected from Possession Island in the Ross Sea in 1841 during James Clark Ross&#x2019; Antarctic expedition by surgeon-naturalist Robert McCormick, after whom it was named.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The South Polar skua is smaller than the subantarctic skua, and has a stubbier bill. It occurs in three plumage morphs: a pale morph in which the bird may have an overall soft buff to honey colouration with dark wings; a dark morph of chocolate brown; and an intermediate morph of grey-brown with dark wings. Paler birds often have a yellowish patch on the nape. All have a whitish outer-wing patch.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: the distinctive territorial display with raised &#x2018;Viking helmet&#x2019; wings is accompanied by a raw descending &#x2018;ah-ah-ah&#x2019; long-call, which sounds &#x2018;cracked&#x2019; in comparison with same call from &#xA0;subantarctic skua. Quack-like anxiety calls are given on the ground in territory. The alarm call, which may start on the ground and continue during repeated high-speed stoop attacks on intruder (skua, human, seal &#x2013; but not penguins) is an ear-splitting scream. The alarm call is often initiated by the incubating bird, which triggers alarm calls (and attack) by the partner. Otherwise quiet in flight and at sea.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: in the New Zealand region, dark morph birds most likely to be confused with the larger subantarctic skua; the two species are very similar unless direct size comparison is possible. Juvenile southern black-backed gulls are more slightly built, and have narrower wings lacking a whitish outer-wing patch.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Polar skuas breed only in Antarctica, where they have a circumpolar distribution (though possible absent from the Balleny Islands and Scott Island in the northern Ross Sea). They breed along Victoria Land coast and islands, including Ross Island, in the Ross Sea. It departs Antarctica each winter and disperses widely across the Atlantic and Pacific, including New Zealand waters. The South Polar skuas have the greatest longitudinal range of any bird, having been recorded at the South Pole and (during its annual migrations) the coasts of Japan, British Columbia and Greenland. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When not breeding, South Polar skuas live entirely at sea. Preferred breeding habitat is coastal ice-free areas, often near Adelie penguin colonies or petrel breeding grounds. They may also breed at inland nunataks, sometimes in association with breeding Antarctic or snow petrels upon which they prey. Non-breeding and &#x2018;off-duty&#x2019; skuas aggregate at non-territorial &#x2018;clubs&#x2019;, often near meltwater pools, or on beaches.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Ross Sea population is estimated at 15,000 individuals.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At sea, possible risk of fisheries &#x2018;by-catch&#x2019;, particularly in areas beyond New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone where &#x2018;pirate&#x2019; fishing may occur without mitigation techniques. At Antarctic breeding grounds, risks potentially arise from human activity, including research and tourism disturbance, and competitive use of ice-free areas for construction of stations and airstrips. Access to open water for feeding may be affected by unusual ice or iceberg events. Overall, the greatest threat for South Polar skuas is likely environmental impacts of climate change on marine productivity.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Polar skuas are monogamous, with shared incubation, brooding, chick-feeding and defence. Nests are bare scrapes. Two large pale-green mottled eggs are laid November-December. Incubation takes 26-34 days, and chicks fledge after 45-50 days. The majority of adults and juveniles depart breeding grounds in March.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Polar skuas are present at their breeding grounds only during the summer. Their ecology and behaviour reflects the short Antarctic season. The birds are intensely territorial during the breeding season and, likely constrained by available terrain, occupy generally smaller territories than subantarctic skuas. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">South Polar skuas feed at sea during the winter, taking prey and debris on or just below sea-surface. During the breeding season in the southern Ross Sea the most important prey are Antarctic silverfish, <em>Pleuragramma antarcticum</em>. South Polar skuas also take eggs and chicks of Adelie penguins and (where available, particularly at inland nunataks) petrels. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/gulls-terns-and-skuas/7\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/gulls-terns-and-skuas/7</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Polar_Skua\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Polar_Skua</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The Pomarine skua has the same range of light to dark plumage variations as Arctic skua. Most are pale below. Breeding birds have diagnostic long, twisted, spoon-shaped tail-streamers up to 11 cm long with rounded tips. Adult non-breeding birds lack these or have shorter, less twisted tail-streamers. A slower, heavier, more purposeful flier than Arctic skua, with less falcon-like wing beats. Resembles subantarctic skua or southern black-backed gull and tends to chase larger birds than the Arctic skua. The sexes are alike. Pale adults have a brown back, mainly white underparts and dark wing feathers with a white &quot;flash&quot; near each end. The throat and neck are white with a yellowish tinge on the neck, contrasting with the black cap and cheeks. Dark adults are all dark brown. Intermediate adults are dark with paler underparts, head and neck. All have white wing &quot;flashes&quot;, though these are less prominent on dark birds. Pale morph juveniles have a characteristic pale rump, absent in Arctic skua. Tail-streamers are lost during the austral summer which often makes adults difficult to separate from juveniles.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: harsh, gull-like &quot;<em>kowk</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>geck</em>&quot; alarm calls and mewing contact calls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Arctic skua and long-tailed skua. Arctic skua weighs around 25% less and is more falcon-like with a smaller, triangular looking head and smaller white wing &quot;flashes&quot;. Long-tailed skua weighs around 50% less and is more tern-like with more buoyant flight. All three species have long tail-streamers when breeding but these are lost or very short outside the breeding season. All have dark, pale and intermediate forms with juvenile, immature and adult breeding and non-breeding plumage variations. There are 36 potential plumage variations to sort through when identifying birds at sea, hence the importance of noting differences in flight and behaviour.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Regular but uncommon visitor to New Zealand from December to April. Most New Zealand records are from Auckland, with fewer from Northland, south to Fouveaux Strait, and east to Chatham Islands. They are most often seen off sandy coastal beaches rather than in sheltered waters. Mainly pelagic outside the breeding season, sometimes joins Arctic skuas inshore to harrass terns and gulls. Often flies over land near the sea, including on migration.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">World population is estimated at between 250,000 and 3 million individuals. In New Zealand there were single records of birds in each year between 1997 and 2000, three records each year in 2002 and 2003, one record at the Chatham Islands in 2004, no records between 2005 and 2008, and one record in 2009. These records probably underestimate the frequency at which pomarine skuas visit New Zealand waters.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The IUCN Red List classifies it as Not Threatened. Department of Conservation classifies it as a migrant that is safe overseas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Circumpolar breeder in Arctic and subarctic low-lying tundra and islands between June and August. Breeds in scattered colonies but less sociable than other skua species. Monogamous; 1-2 eggs, laid in a shallow plant-lined nest on the ground. Incubation shared. Chicks are dependent on both parents for food for two weeks after fledging, which occurs at 21-27 days. Migrates south during September to low latitudes of Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans for the austral summer before returning to Arctic breeding grounds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">An opportunistic predator and scavenger that chases terns, gulls and other seabirds to pirate food from them. After&#xA0;laboured chases, usually flies low and direct between feeding flocks of terns or rests on the sea with head and tail held high. Often feeds singly but sometimes joins small flocks of Arctic skuas chasing terns and gulls. An exceptional group of 38 birds was recorded in the Tasman Sea, 100 km off the Waikato coast. Pomarine skua possibly arose as a result of hybridisation between great skua (<em>Catharacta skua</em>) and Arctic skua (<em>Stercorarius parasiticus</em>), and is placed in its own genus, <em>Coprotheres,</em> pending resolution of skua taxonomy.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pirates food from gulls, terns, shearwaters and other seabirds up to the size of boobies and gannets. Able to kill small adult gulls by chasing and forcing them into the sea; catches own fish if necessary. Scavenges carrion and discarded waste from boats at sea. During the Arctic breeding season hunts and eats small mammals such as lemmings and other birds of the Arctic tundra up to the size of a gull.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomarine_Jaeger\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomarine_Jaeger</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3200\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3200</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">del Hoyo, J; Elliot, A.; Sargatal, J.

The Arctic skua is the commonest of the three holarctic skua species that visit New Zealand during the austral summer before migrating north to Arctic and subarctic breeding grounds. They are often seen in New Zealand coastal waters, although it is unusual to see aggregations of more than 10 birds at once. A few immature birds over-winter. Arctic skuas are usually seen in coastal waters, harbours, sounds and estuaries. Pursues other seabirds forcing them to drop fish they have caught. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Arctic skua is a medium-sized, graceful skua with long, pointed wings and a deep, rounded belly resembling a falcon in flight. It is the most abundant Arctic breeding skua, hence its common name. There are three adult plumage forms: dark, pale and intermediate, each with highly variable breeding, non-breeding, juvenile and immature plumages. 80% of birds in&#xA0;New Zealand&#xA0;are dark. Most adults have pale white panels or &quot;flashes&quot; near the end of their wings. Breeding birds have two long, thin tapering central tail-streamers that project up to 10.5 cm past the tail. Non-breeding adults have short, worn tail-streamers that only project a few centimetres past the tail. Juveniles and immatures lack tail-streamers. Dark adults are blackish-brown. Pale adults when breeding have a dark cap, white cheeks and throat, yellow-tinged nape, mainly white underparts and a dark back. Intermediate birds are dark blackish-brown with variable paler underparts, head and neck. Highly variable juveniles have barred underwings, a rusty brown body with darker mottling and barring, and paler streaked neck. Immatures develop adult plumage over several years with most resembling non-breeding adults. Immature pale birds are more heavily barred with a paler brown face and underparts and face, and a lightly barred rump and undertail. Sexes alike.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: shrill staccato calls in pursuit. Alarm call a short, gull-like &apos;pjew&apos;.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: two other holarctic skua species occur more rarely in New Zealand, with all three having highly variable plumage. Arctic skua is intermediate between the smaller long-tailed skua and larger pomarine skua. The slimmer, more tern-like long-tailed skua is most similar but with proportionally longer tail-streamers, a more prominent chest, and longer, narrower wings. The bulkier pomarine skua has a larger bill, head, neck and chest, with breeding birds having diagnostic twisted, spoon-shaped tail-streamers with rounded tips. Adult non-breeding pomarine skuas have shorter, less twisted tail-streamers. All three have dark, light and intermediate forms with juvenile, immature and adult breeding and non-breeding plumage morphs. There are 36 potential plumage variations to sort through when identifying skuas at sea. This makes it important to note differences in flight and behaviour. Arctic skua is most falcon-like with triangular looking head, flat chest and deeper, rounded belly. Long-tailed skua is more tern-like with more buoyant flight and relies more on surface feeding. Pomarine skua has slower, more direct flight with heavier wing beats, resembling a larger gull. The similar-sized Kermadec petrel also has dark, light and intermediate plumage forms, white wing flashes, and is thought to mimic foraging skuas. It may use its resemblance of skuas to parasitise other seabirds with more success than it would have otherwise.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Occurs around the mainland and Chatham Islands in coastal waters, harbours, sounds and estuaries from November to April. Most often recorded from Northland, Hauraki Gulf, Marlborough Sounds and Banks Peninsula.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">World population estimated at between 500,000 and 10 million individuals. Commonly seen in New Zealand coastal waters, although it is unusual to see aggregations of more than 10 birds at once. Recorded from the Kermadec Islands (1964, 1979) and Antipodes Island (1926).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">IUCN Red List classifies it as Not Threatened. In the UK a decline in numbers of breeding pairs was recorded 1986-2007 with reduced availability of fish during breeding thought to be the cause. Department of Conservation classifies it as a migrant that is secure overseas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Circumpolar breeder in Arctic and subarctic coastal tundra and moorland. Breeds singly or in loose colonies, May-August. Migrates south during September to spend the austral summer at sea in southern temperate oceans. Monogamous; 1-4 (usually 2) olive-brown eggs with sparse reddish-brown markings laid in shallow plant-lined nest on ground. Incubation and chick-rearing shared. Young leave the nest at 4 weeks to migrate with adults.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">An opportunistic predator and scavenger that is aggressively tenacious in its pursuit of smaller terns or gulls until they disgorge their food which the skua catches while it falls. Usually feeds alone or in small flocks. Gatherings of up to 50 reported off northern North Island. White wing flashes thought to advertise parasitism and may act as signal between skuas not to parasitise each other. Long-distance migrant in loose flocks from Arctic and subarctic to temperate southern oceans. Loose flock of seven recorded south of Kermadec Islands flying south-west towards North Island, probably on migration. Most arrive October-November and depart March-April. Typically lives 12 years with one bird recorded 25 years old.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Arctic skua is the most parasitic of the holartic skuas. Mainly feeds by prolonged, twisting flight-pursuit of terns or gulls forcing them to drop fish they have caught, which the skua grabs as it falls. Also scavenges discarded waste from boats. During breeding season kills small mammals such as lemmings and small birds of the Arctic tundra.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_Jaeger\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_Jaeger</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.handaskuas.org/arctic_skua/\">http://www.handaskuas.org/arctic_skua/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">del Hoyo, J; Elliot, A.; Sargatal, J.

The long-tailed skua is the smallest of the three holarctic-breeding skua species that regularly visit New Zealand. Up to 5 have been recorded during the austral summer before migrating to Arctic and subarctic breeding grounds. Most records of these highly pelagic birds come from the North Island. They are more solitary than Arctic skuas, and feed on the surface more often than they pirate food from other seabirds. They often dip to the surface like a tern.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A small, slim, lightly-built skua with long, tern-like narrow wings and a small head and bill. It has two very long, flexible, tapering tail-streamers, hence its common name. Plumage changes occur with ageing, similar to other skuas. Pale adults are more usual in New Zealand than the dark and intermediate morphs. All have grey upperparts, contrasting dark primaries and white wing flashes. Dark adults are rare and poorly known. Non-breeding adults either lack or have only short, pointed tail-streamers. Cheeks, throat, breast and flanks are darker giving a hooded effect and the tail is barred. Juveniles and immatures are paler and greyer than Arctic skuas with short tail-streamers, two white primary shafts on each wing, and more heavily barred underwings and tail. The sexes are alike.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: Harsh &quot;<em>kreeah</em>&quot; cry at sea.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the long-tailed skua is the smallest of the three holarctic-breeding skuas. that migrate to New Zealand waters.&#xA0;Arctic skua is more falcon-like with a triangular looking head and more rounded belly. One quarter heavier, it mainly pirates food from other seabirds. Pomarine skuas are twice as heavy with larger bill, head, neck and chest, and more direct, heavier flight. All three species have long tail-streamers when breeding but with wear and moult these become short or absent during the non-breeding period. All have dark, pale and intermediate forms with juvenile, immature and adult breeding and non-breeding plumages. There are 36 potential plumage variations to sort through when identifying birds at sea, hence the importance of noting differences in flight and behaviour. Long-tailed skua is more tern-like with more buoyant flight, relying more on surface feeding. Pomarine skua has slower, more direct flight with heavier wing beats, resembling a larger gull. Most Arctic skuas are dark, and are larger and more falcon-like than long-tailed skuas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Occurs mainly off North Island from November to February with most records from Northland, Auckland, Wellington and Kapiti Coast. One inland record from Lake Taupo. Seen mostly offshore in pelagic waters, more rarely inshore, usually after rough weather. The main wintering areas are over continental shelf-breaks. El Ni&#xF1;o weather patterns may sometimes&#xA0;move birds west from their usual non-breeding range to New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">World population is estimated at between 150,000 and 5 million individuals. In New Zealand there are no records in some years and up to five records in others.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The IUCN Red List classifies it as Not Threatened. Department of Conservation classifies it as a migrant that is secure overseas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Circumpolar breeder from subarctic to high Arctic on dry or montane tundra up to 1,300 metres above sea level. Breeds singly or in loose colonies. Migrates south during September to southern subtropical and temperate oceans for the austral summer. A few visit the south-west Pacific each year, including Australia and New Zealand. Monogamous; 1-2 eggs, laid in a shallow plant-lined nest on ground. Breeding period June-August. Females incubate more than males. Incubation 24 days. Chicks stay in nest 1-2 days after hatching. One parent, usually female, remains near nest while other forages. Male usually brings and regurgitates food; female feeds chick. Young often remain with parents 1-3 weeks after fledging at 22-27 days.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Highly pelagic migrant, rarely within sight of land outside the northern Arctic breeding season. Feeds at sea surface, also hovers and dips, tern-like. None of the birds seen in New Zealand waters were recorded pirating food from other seabirds. Longevity 8 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mainly feeds on small fish taken from the sea surface. Recorded pirating food from a silver gull and a grey-faced petrel in Australia, but apparently does so less frequently than other skuas do. During the breeding season they kill small mammals such as lemmings and smaller birds of the Arctic tundra.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_Jaeger\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_Jaeger</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3202\">www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3202</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">del Hoyo, J; Elliot, A.; Sargatal, J.

In Australia it is under threat from the more versatile southern black-backed gull, which after self-introducing from about the 1940s, is rapidly expanding its breeding range in Tasmania and south-eastern Australia. The eastern subspecies possibly numbers no more than 1,100 breeding pairs, whereas the population of the western subspecies <em>georgii</em>, is considered secure. Pacific gulls are well known for taking molluscs (e.g. limpets, turban shells, mussels), flying to some height over rocks and then dropping them to smash the shells open. Sometimes, however, the gull will fly down and catch the shell before hitting the ground, and there is some debate as to whether the practice is primarily one of food gathering or play.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A large black-and-white gull, significantly larger than southern black-backed gull, although overall similar in general appearance. When compared to the southern black-backed gull, the Pacific gull has a massive bill with a prominent &#x2018;gonys&#x2019; (angular bend near the tip of the lower mandible) and rounded nostrils. In adults, the red tip to the bill is on both the upper and lower mandibles (southern black-backed gull has a red spot only on the lower mandible), and the tail of an adult Pacific gull has a broad dark sub-terminal band, clearly visible in flight. There is less white on the wings of an adult Pacific gull, apparent both at rest and in flight.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a shouted &#x2018;<em>ow-ow</em>&#x2019; which can be quite long, also short &#x2018;<em>oh-oh&#x2019;</em>, throaty &#x2018;<em>cark-cark&#x2019;</em> or &#x2018;<em>auk-auk&#x2019;</em>, chuckles and stutters. Quite different in character to southern black-backed gull calls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: southern black-backed gull. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The southern and west coasts of Australia from as far north as Sydney in the east to Shark Bay in the west. Ironically, it is rare on the Pacific (east) coast of mainland Australia, with its strongholds being Bass Strait, Tasmania, Kangaroo Island, Recherche Archipelago, Houtman Abrolhos and Shark Bay. Much less an urban bird, and less adaptable than the southern black-backed gull, the Pacific gull favours sandy and rocky coasts. In eastern Australia it prefers more sheltered environments, away from ocean swells, but in the west it prefers exposed situations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The only New Zealand record was an immature bird at Glinks Gully, Dargaville Beach in January 2010.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pacific gulls can often be found loafing or roosting high up on rocky cliffs, or man-made structures such as jetties, pylons and wharves. They nest on offshore islands, either as isolated pairs or small colonies. Both sexes build the nest, which can either be a well-formed bowl of collected material, or an unlined or lined scrape in the ground. Two or three mottled brown eggs are laid.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A carnivore with a wide-ranging diet, the Pacific gull will hunt or scavenge as the opportunity presents itself. Known to hunt a number of bird species, both during the day and at night, up to the size of short-tailed shearwater. Pacific gulls are capable of swallowing quite large prey items whole. They also steal fish from fishing birds such as gannets, scavenge offal from fishermen, prise molluscs from rocks, eat beachcast carrion, and consume fur seal vomit and placentae. Food also includes crabs, squid, worms, echinoderms and chitons.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/pacific-gull-larus-pacificus\">http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/pacific-gull-larus-pacificus</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/pacific-gull\">http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/pacific-gull</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J.

Found on or over all non-forested habitats from coastal waters to high-country farms, this is the only large gull found in New Zealand. They are particularly abundant at landfills, around ports and at fish-processing plants.</p>\n<p>Known widely as &#x2018;kelp gull&#x2019; in other countries, the same species is also common in similar latitudes around the southern hemisphere, including southern Australia, South America, southern Africa, and most subantarctic and peri-Antarctic islands, and the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The familiar large gull throughout New Zealand. Adults have white head and underparts with black back, yellow bill with red spot near tip of lower mandible, and pale green legs. Juveniles are dark mottled brown with black bill and legs; their plumage lightens with age until they moult into adult plumage at 3 years old.</p>\n<p>Voice: a long series of loud calls &#x2018;<em>ee-ah-ha-ha-ha</em>&#x2019; etc, given in territorial and aggressive contexts.</p>\n<p>Similar species: adults unmistakeable apart from possible vagrant Pacific gull from Australia (which has a more massive bill, and a black subterminal tip to tail). Juveniles may be confused with the more robust brown skua, which has broader wings with a pale flash at the base of the primaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout New Zealand in most habitats other than forest and scrub. Abundant anywhere food scraps, offal and other organic waste can be obtained, including landfills and wharves. Common in estuaries and harbours, rocky and sandy shores and riverbeds; occurs more sparsely inland over farmland, and even subalpine tussockland and herbfields. The largest breeding colonies are on islands, steep headlands, sand or shingle spits, or on islands in shingle riverbeds. Breeds on most outlying islands; vagrant to Kermadec Is and Ross Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Very abundant: hundreds of colonies throughout the country, many exceeding 100 pairs, and a few exceeding 1000 pairs. Often gathers in large feeding and roosting flocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>One of only two native bird species not afforded any level of protection under the Wildlife Act. Black-backed gulls are often considered pests, especially at airports (where they are a major cause of bird-strike), and on farmland, where some attack cast sheep and newborn lambs. As a result, they are sometimes shot, or controlled using toxins or by pricking their eggs. At a few sites, they are controlled to reduce their predatory impacts on threatened shorebirds, e.g. New Zealand dotterel, shore plover and fairy tern.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Colonial or solitary; monogamous, with shared incubation and chick care. Nest a bulky collection of grass, small sticks or seaweed, or a simple scrape in sand or shingle. Clutch 2-3 large grey-green eggs with dark brown spots and blotches. Laying mainly Oct-Jan. Incubation 23-26 days; chicks fledge at about 7-8 weeks old, and are fed by adults for at least another month.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Bold and conspicuous, black-backed gulls are often attracted to food sources provided inadvertently or deliberately by people. In cities, they often roost and even nest on roofs. They are common in urban parks, seeking hand-outs and scraps, or harvesting earthworms from water-logged playing fields. Black-backed gulls are often seen on the water&#x2019;s edge where they scavenge corpses and fish frames washed up on the tide. Flocks follow ploughs or inshore fishing boats with equal vigour. Nest sites and colonies are defended with loud, persistent calls; some will swoop at human intruders, but they are typically wary, and never make contact (unlike skuas and some terns). Black-backed gulls are harried by smaller gulls and terns when they approach their nesting colonies, although they often nest in close proximity.</p>\n<p>Generally considered &#x2018;super-abundant&#x2019; due to increased food supply from human sources, there are only a few remote island groups where black-backed gulls occur at what are considered natural densities, with isolated pairs breeding on rock stacks and headlands.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black-backed gulls are both predators and scavengers, and have been recorded catching and consuming a wide range of marine and terrestrial invertebrates, fish, small mammals, birds and their eggs and chicks. They consume large quantities of organic waste from landfills and farms (e.g. docked lambs&#x2019; tails), plus offal from fishing boats and processing factories. Flocks gather at stranded or floating marine mammal carcasses, plus dead farm stock, where they consume both flesh and maggots.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp_Gull\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp_Gull</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/gulls-terns-and-skuas/1\">www.teara.govt.nz/en/gulls-terns-and-skuas/1</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Fordham, R.A. 1968.

They are only occasionally seen inland, and are resident on their breeding grounds in the southern part of their range year-round. Birds north of North Carolina typically migrate south for the winter. They are rare vagrants in Britain and western Europe, and have been recorded on at least 10 occasions in Australia.&#xA0; The first New Zealand record was a second-winter bird first identified on 23 December 2016 at the Te Ahiaua Reserve, Waiotahi River estuary, west of Opotiki in the Bay of Plenty. Over the following weeks the same individual was sighted at several points along the coast between the Opotiki wharf and Ohiwa Harbour. A couple living near the Opotiki wharf who fed gulls in their garden reportedly first noticed the bird around the beginning of December 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>A medium-sized gull, slightly larger than a red-billed gull. Breeding adults have an entirely black head with prominent white upper and lower eyelids. Non-breeders have variable amounts of dark smudgy colouring on the head, particularly behind the eyes and around the nape.&#xA0; The upper surfaces of the wings are mostly a smooth dark grey (darker than on red-billed gulls) with a white trailing edge (visible as a short broken white stripe across the back when the wings are folded), and sooty black wingtips; the inner primaries have small white tips.&#xA0; The underwings are grey in juveniles, becoming white with age.&#xA0; Juveniles have extensive, mottled dark coloration on the sides of the neck and breast; as the birds age this becomes less extensive and more even in colour &#x2013; breeding adults have white underparts.&#xA0; The tail and rump are white, though there is a dark tail band in the first year. The bill is large and long, red when breeding, blackish with sometimes a faintly reddish tip when non-breeding.

They are primarily coastal, but can be found on landfills and lakes a short distance inland, and occasionally much further, particularly on migration and in winter.

In breeding plumage the bill is mainly dark red but becomes blackish with a red tip in the non-breeding season. The legs are blackish. Apart from this the colour pattern is similar to that of other small gulls. The back is darker slate grey than the red-billed gull; the neck, breast, belly and underwing surfaces are white. The upper surfaces of the wing are grey like the back with a white trailing edge and a distinctive pattern at the tips. There is a black band across the end but the flight feathers are tipped white and there is another whitish band on the inside as well.

Except for a colony at Lake Rotorua, it rarely is found inland. It is commonly seen in coastal towns, garbage dumps and at fish processing facilities. Immature adults are often confused with the closely related black-billed gull. Recently the largest colonies in different parts of New Zealand have exhibited a marked decline in numbers (i.e. Kaikoura, Three Kings and Mokohinau Islands). The bird tends to nest at the same locality from one season to the next, and offspring mostly return to their natal colony to breed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sexes are similar, but males are slightly larger with a longer and stouter bill. They are almost completely white but the mantle, back and wing coverts are pale grey. The main flight feathers are black with white tips. The iris is white and the bill, eyelids and feet are scarlet, especially in the breeding season, being more dull during the rest of the year. Immatures are similar to adults, except they have brown patches on the mantle and the primaries are brownish in colour rather than black. The iris, bill and legs of immatures are dark brown. Adult plumage is attained in the second year; birds of this age class&#xA0;can be recognised by the brownish-black tip to the bill, and the primary feathers have a brownish tinge instead of black in older individuals. The subantarctic race is stouter.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a wide range of calls are used in different circumstances. The alarm call used during the breeding season is a strident &quot;kek&quot;.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the red-billed gull is often confused with the similar-looking black-billed gull, especially as juveniles and immature birds of both species have an overlapping range of bill and leg colours. The black-billed gull is always a paler, more elegant bird, with a longer, more slender bill, and with less black on the outer wing. In the South Island, the black-billed gull is seen inland more frequently than the red-billed gull.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-billed gulls are found in most coastal locations throughout New Zealand. They are also commonly found in towns, scavenging on human refuse and offal from fish and meat processing works. They are seldom found inland. On mainland New Zealand, breeding occurs in dense colonies, mainly restricted to the eastern coasts of the North and South Islands on stacks, cliffs, river mouths and sandy and rocky shores. On outlying islands they breed on the Chatham, Campbell, Snares and Auckland Islands. Here, their nests are concealed and located singly or in small groups. There is a single record of a vagant bird (banded at Kaikoura) found dead in Australia.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The red-billed gull is a very abundant species that has recently suffered huge declines at its three main breeding colonies (Three Kings Islands, Mokohinau Islands and Kaikoura Peninsula). At Kaikoura the decline began in 1994, and between 1983 and 2005 the population declined by 51%. In contrast, with mammalian predator control at the Otago Peninsula, the population has seen a 6-10% annual increase in the 20 years since 1992, leading to a three- or four-fold increase in the local population.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A major threat to breeding birds is predation from introduced predators such as cats, ferrets, rats and stoats. Climate-induced fluctuation in the availability of krill, the principal food of the birds during the breeding season, has a major impact on breeding success.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-billed gulls breed in large, dense colonies on the mainland, but in scattered or solitary concealed situations on the subantarctic islands, probably to help avoid skua predation. They have an extremely long egg-laying period that can extend from mid-September to January. They are monogamous, with the sexes sharing approximately equally in nest-building, incubation and provisioning the chicks. Nests are well developed and consist of grass, seaweed or twigs. The clutch size is normally two eggs, but one and three egg clutches sometimes occur. Supernormal clutches of up to five eggs can occur in female-female associations. Eggs are ovoid, mainly brownish or greenish-grey with dark brown spots or blotches. Incubation lasts 21-25 days and chicks begin to fly at 35 days and continue to be fed for another c. 30 days. At most colonies, especially at the largest, adults and chicks return to the same colony in which they previously bred or were hatched. If successful at a particular site, adults often return the next year to the same portion of the colony. At Lake Rotorua in a mixed colony of red-billed gulls and black-billed gulls interbreeding has been recorded. The hybrids have been fertile and have bred with red-billed gulls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Kaikoura approximately 83% of pairs retain partners from one season to the next. The longest period that a pair remained together was 17 years. Divorce is highest in young birds and in pairs breeding together for the first time, especially if they were unsuccessful the previous season. An important feature of breeding is courtship feeding of the female by the male. Courtship feeding increases in frequency 16 days prior to the laying of the first egg. If the female is being adequately fed by the male, the female is able to remain in the nest territory for much of the day. Like most species of gulls and terns, the red-billed gull has a sex ratio that is biased in favour of females. At Kaikoura females make up 54.9% of the population. As a result, about 7% of the pairings are female-female pairs. These often produce fertile eggs because at least one of the females allows force-copulation by a male paired with another female, or solicits a copulation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main food at the largest colonies is the euphausiid <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em> (krill). At Kaikoura during the breeding season adult gulls can sustain themselves on alternative foods such as earthworms, small fish, garbage and kelp flies, but they are dependent upon an abundant and regular supply of the surface-swarming krill for successful breeding. Outside of the breeding season the diet is highly variable. Some still feed at sea; others feed on small invertebrates along the shore, or&#xA0;from human sources such as handouts in towns or cities, offal being discarded from fishing boats and garbage at rubbish dumps.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-billed_Gull\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-billed_Gull</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Falla, R.A.; Sibson, R.A.; Turbott, E.G.1966. <em>A field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

However, following the transfer of <em>D. cauta</em> to the genus <em>Thalassarche</em> it was elevated to specific status. Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawk frequents New Zealand coastal waters, especially south from Cook Strait and is a familiar albatross scavenging around commercial and recreational fishing vessels.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawk is a typical medium-sized albatross. It is black across the upperwings, with a white lower back and rump and black tip to the tail. The underparts are white with narrow black borders under the wing and a small black notch in the &#x201C;armpit&#x201D; at the base of the leading edge of the wing. The head, throat and nape are pale grey, creating a hooded effect. The bill is grey-green, with a paler top and bottom and a black spot at the tip of the lower bill. Juveniles fledge with olive-brown bills with a dark tip, but apparently immediately depart New Zealand waters, and do not return until they have adult colouration.</p>\n<p>Voice: Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks are usually silent at sea, though may give harsh croaking when squabbling for food. They utter a variety of brays, croaks and wails during courtship.</p>\n<p>Similar species: White-capped and Chatham Island mollymawks are close relatives, but all are separated by the degree of grey on the head and the bill colour. White-capped mollymawk has a white head and neck, with a small black patch in front of the eyes and a grey wash on the cheeks. Its bill has grey-blue sides with yellowish top, bottom and tip. Chatham Island mollymawk is the darkest-faced of the three and has a bright yellow bill with a dark spot near the tip of the lower mandible. Juveniles of Buller&#x2019;s and Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks are very similar, but both species fly across the Pacific Ocean to seas off Chile and Peru as soon as they fledge. Juvenile Buller&#x2019;s mollymawks are smaller and slimmer, with less robust bills.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>During the breeding season (August-April) Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks occur throughout coastal New Zealand, especially from Cook Strait south, and also across to south-east Australian waters. After breeding it migrates to seas off Peru and Chile and occurs as a vagrant in the South Atlantic. A small population of a few pairs was reported breeding on the Crozet Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks breed on the Bounty Islands and the Snares Western Chain, plus breeding attempts have been made by isolated pairs and individuals (mating with Chatham Island mollymawks) in the Chatham Islands. The main breeding population is at the Bounty Islands where about 76,000 breeding pairs were estimated in 1978 compared to about 31,000 breeding pairs in 1997 and 41,000 breeding pairs in 2010. However, the methods used to obtain these three estimates are not comparable. Direct counts of breeding pairs at the Snares Western Chain in the three years 2008-2010 resulted in estimates of 1100-1200 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>All breeding sites are free from mammalian predators, although an expanding New Zealand fur seal population at the Bounty Islands may be affecting breeding success. Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawk was the second most common albatross species observed killed in the New Zealand fisheries 1998-2004 with demersal longliners and trawling operations responsible for the majority of mortalities. The conservation status of this species was moved from nationally vulnerable to nationally critical in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawk breed in large, densely packed colonies. They are monogamous with shared incubation and chick care. The nest is a pedestal of mud, guano and debris accumulated from the immediate vicinity, and used and added to year after year. The single large (104 x 67 mm) white egg is laid in August-September. Incubation takes 65-75 days; chicks fledge in February-April at about 115-130 days-old, and are independent at fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>As a typical albatross, Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks have perfected soaring flight. In strong winds they wheel effortlessly on their long, narrow, stiffly held wings. They use their webbed feet for swimming and as rudders when coming in to land. Their strongly hooked bills are used to grasp prey whilst the sharp edges of the upper mandible are used to slice it into manageable portions. However, albatrosses have a great capacity to extend the throat, and so can swallow large pieces of food.</p>\n<p>At their breeding colonies Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks use an elaborate series of displays and calls to maintain their pair bond and to defend their nest pedestal. Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks are annual breeders that usually return to the same nest site year after year with the same partner.&#xA0; After breeding the colonies are deserted and the birds migrate across the Pacific to seas off Chile and Peru. Banding shows that about 97% of adults survive from one year to the next, and so oldest birds would live for over 30 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Salvin&#x2019;s mollymawks mainly eat fish, squid, krill, salps and offal from fishing vessels taken from the surface. They rarely plunge or dive for food.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvin&apos;s_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvin&apos;s_Albatross</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/297-salvin-s-albatross/file\">http://www.acap.aq/en/acap-species/297-salvin-s-albatross/file</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

They were originally assigned to the same genus as other albatrosses, but later separated, which has been vindicated by molecular phylogeny showing that sooty albatrosses are most closely related to mollymawks. The sooty albatross <em>Phoebetria fusca</em> was described in 1822 from a specimen from the Mozambique Channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The sooty albatross is a slender all-dark chocolate brown albatross with a long pointed tail (wedge to diamond shaped when spread, rarely seen at sea except when feeding), slender head, long narrow wings usually flexed at the carpal joint, and a typically effortless flight, smoother and overall higher above the water than in other albatrosses (except for the light-mantled sooty albatross). Adults in fresh plumage are entirely dark brown except for the whitish shafts of primaries and main tail feathers, a white crescent above and behind the eye, and a cream to yellow-orange stripe (sulcus) on the side of the slender glossy black bill. In juveniles, the sulcus is dark to flesh grey, and the crescent above and behind the eye is dull greyish white, with both only discernible in close view. In worn plumage, both adults and immatures become paler and mottled with buff edges to the contour feathers, especially on the nape and the sides of the neck, with worn birds appearing to have a pale whitish cream to buff collar highlighting a dark &#x201C;burglar&#x2019;s&#x201D; face mask. Such plumage wear during the breeding season is indicative of non-breeding status, whether immature or adult. The legs and feet are pinkish mauve to greyish flesh.</p>\n<p>Similar species: light-mantled sooty albatrosses have a pale grey (not dark brown) back, a pale blue (not cream or yellow) stripe on the side of the bill, and, in worn plumage, whitish rather than cream pale areas on sides of neck, nape and also extending to the upper back, contrasting with the dark upper wings. Light-mantled sooty albatrosses also have a concave (not straight) edge to the upper mandible. Black-footed albatrosses have a distinct pale area surrounding the black bill. All dark giant petrels (juveniles and immatures of both species) are larger, heavier and bulkier looking, with a proportionately larger head and a distinctly pale (not black) and massive bill. Juvenile wandering albatrosses, which are even larger and heavier looking, are also mostly dark brown, but have a distinctive white face mask and underwings, and a pale pinkish bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty albatrosses breed on volcanic islands in the South Atlantic Ocean (Gough Island and Tristan da Cunha group) and southern Indian Ocean (Prince Edward, Crozet, Kerguelen, Amsterdam and Saint Paul island groups). The world population is in the order 13,000 - 14,000 pairs, with Gough, Tristan, Prince Edward and Crozet the main breeding localities. Serious recent declines (up to 7% per year) have been recorded at most of the latter localities, mostly due to accidental captures on high seas longlines.</p>\n<p>At sea, sooty albatrosses are mostly confined to the South Atlantic and South Indian Oceans, ranging from 40&#xB0;W (rarely further west towards Cape Horn) eastwards to the Great Australian Bight, the approaches to Bass Strait and South Tasman Rise, with stragglers to New South Wales and New Zealand. The latitudinal distribution extends from 35&#xB0;S to 65&#xB0;S (southern subtropical to Antarctic waters) in summer, and from 25&#xB0;S to 40&#xB0;S (subtropical waters) in winter. Immatures apparently stay in subtropical waters throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Sooty albatrosses forage primarily over deep oceanic waters, south of Australia also over the continental slope and submarine rises. Birds tracked while breeding (August-May) foraged between 31&#xB0;S and 62&#xB0;S, up to 2200 km (but usually within 600 km) from their nest. Non-breeders stayed in their respective oceans between 25&#xB0;S and 65&#xB0;S, with birds from Gough Island confined to the South Atlantic Ocean, whereas non-breeding adults from the Crozet Islands regularly foraged in the Great Australian Bight. Birds seen in Australasia, mostly from autumn to spring, are thus non-breeders most likely to originate from Indian Ocean breeding islands.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are&#xA0;four accepted records for the New Zealand region: one seen north of the Auckland Islands in February 1991; one seen over the Pukaki Rise on 21-22 Nov 1993; one adult seen and photographed ashore on Antipodes Island in October-November 1995; one seen off the Chatham Islands on 30 Dec 2006.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty albatrosses usually breed in small groups of 5-60 nests, occasionally solitarily, building their pedestal nests on tussock covered ledges of coastal and inland cliffs (latter only at Gough, Tristan and Amsterdam islands). They are biennial breeders, returning to their breeding grounds in mid-July to early September. The single white egg is laid in mid-September to late October. Chicks hatch in December, are brooded for three weeks, and fledge in May to early June after a rearing period of c.5 months. Immatures first return to land when 8 years old, and start breeding when 12 years old (average ages).</p>\n<p>When displaying on land, their distinctive <em>pee-oo</em> skycalls form the trademark soundscape of sooty albatross colonies, cutting through the heaviest surf poundings against the cliff base of colonies. Sooty (and light-mantled sooty) albatrosses also excel in their superb synchronized pair display flight off their colonies, regularly switching flight angles in unison. They have complex and evolving displays of about 15 &#x201C;signs&#x201D; (postures) through which prospective partners progress from fleeting encounters (male sky calling, female landing and &#x201C;glancing&#x201D;) to uneasy acquaintance (scapular action, bill pointing, bill clashing) to close bond (mutual skycalling and preening) spanning up to several months ashore.</p>\n<p>Being rather shy and low down in the dominance hierarchy among large procellariiformes, sooty albatrosses are mostly solitary feeders at sea, although they occasionally associate with yellow-nosed mollymawks and whales. Based on activity loggers, they forage mostly during daytime, with a peak of feeding activity in the last three hours before dusk.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty albatrosses feed mostly on cephalopods (up to 95% by frequency, 42% by mass; most frequent species <em>Histioteuthis eltaninae</em>, <em>Batoteuthis </em>sp.<em>, Chiroteuthis </em>spp and<em> Galiteuthis glacialis</em>) and on carrion more extensively than other albatrosses (up to 55% by frequency, 51% by mass; mostly remains of crested penguins and prions). Of lesser importance are fish (up to 57% by frequency, 33% by mass) and crustaceans (up to 50% by frequency, 3% by mass; most frequent species krill <em>Euphausia superba</em>, amphipod <em>Themisto gaudichaudii</em>, and mysid <em>Gnathophausia gigas</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3967\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3967</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/nature/tsprofileSootyAlbatross.pdf\">http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/nature/tsprofileSootyAlbatross.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/sooty-albatross/phoebetria-fusca/\">http://www.arkive.org/sooty-albatross/phoebetria-fusca/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels. 2010.

It has a dark sooty-brown body and head, with greyish-brown neck and back feathers, which distinguishes it from the similar-looking sooty albatross. The bill is dark with a pale blue stripe along the lower mandible, and there is a crescent of white feathers around the eye, giving the bird a slightly comical aspect.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The light-mantled sooty albatross is one of a pair of sooty albatross species that have extremely pointed wings, wedge-shaped tails, and chocolate-brown colouration. Their flight is effortless, and courting birds at breeding grounds are often seen in pairs in a synchronised aerodynamic display. The light-mantled sooty albatross is brown all over, except the greyish-brown mantle and back, which give it its name. A white crescent of feathers around the eye, and a pale blue stripe along the lower mandible contrasts with otherwise black bill and dark-brown head.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Voice: &#xA0;light-mantled sooty albatrosses are generally silent at sea. At colonies they give the characteristic &#x2018;sky call&#x2019; <em>pee-aahh</em>, and a braying threat call used to challenge other albatrosses and humans. Bill snapping&#xA0;is also common. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Similar species: the sooty albatross has a dark-brown back, and a cream or yellow (not pale blue) stripe on the lower mandible. Note that sooty albatrosses in worn plumage have a pale whitish cream to buff collar contrasting with the dark face. Giant petrels (juveniles and immatures of both species) are all dark but are larger, heavier and bulkier looking, with a proportionately larger head and a distinctly pale (not black) and massive bill. Black-footed albatrosses have a pale area at the base of the black bill. Juvenile wandering albatrosses, which are even larger and heavier looking, are also mostly dark brown, but have a white face mask and underwings, and a pale pinkish bill.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Light-mantled sooty albatrosses are found around the Southern Ocean, with a circumpolar breeding distribution. They are thought to frequent less productive areas of the ocean, and are not commonly found on shelf-breaks or frontal zones. Due to their lack of tolerance of handling, few satellite tracking studies have been undertaken. They forage in Southern Ocean waters from 40&#xB0; S to the Antarctic ice edge, and are perhaps the most southerly foraging of all albatross species. Light-mantled sooty albatrosses tend to be solitary at sea, and don&#x2019;t follow vessels or scavenge on fisheries waste to the same extent as most other small albatrosses. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Their breeding habitat is in cliffy areas of the subantarctic Islands, where they tend to nest in small groups spaced widely apart. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">In the New Zealand region light-mantled sooty albatross nest on the Antipodes (250 pairs), Auckland (5000 pairs) and Campbell (1600 pairs) Islands and on nearby Macquarie Island. The New Zealand populations account for around 30% of the global population, with a world total of around 20,000 breeding pairs. Population trend information is lacking for New Zealand sites. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The main documented threat for light-mantled sooty albatrosses is mortality in longline fisheries, especially on the high seas, where the main overlap of the species&#x2019; range and the fisheries occurs. However, specific information is lacking as there is very little scientific observer deployment in these fisheries. Occasional captures in monitored fisheries indicates that the species has very low capture rates in longline fisheries. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Light-mantled sooty albatrosses breed as monogamous pairs in the austral summer, over an extended period. Like the great albatrosses, but unlike mollymawks, they breed once every two years. The single large (102 x 65 mm) white egg is laid in October or November; incubation is shared and takes about 67 days, with most hatching in December. The chick is fed by regurgitation by both parents, and fledges in May-June.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Light-mantled sooty albatross diet has been studied at South Georgia, Crozet and Prince Edward Islands. It feeds mainly on squid (33-56% of diet by fresh mass), followed by fish (10-45%) and crustaceans (4-40%), with large variation in the importance of these last two groups by breeding site. Analyses of squid species present in the diet show that light-mantled sooty albatrosses feed closer to the Antarctic than other albatross species.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-mantled_Albatross\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-mantled_Albatross</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3971\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3971</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/albatrosslmsooty.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/albatrosslmsooty.html</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.acap.aq/\">www.acap.aq</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p align=\"left\">Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 2012.

Although they resemble mollymawks and albatrosses, they are more closely related to five smaller fulmarine petrel species, including the Antarctic fulmar, Cape petrel and snow petrel. They have two large tube nostrils that are joined together on the top of the huge bill, in contrast to those of albatrosses which are smaller and separated, lying one on each side of the bill. Giant petrels&apos; wings are shorter than mollymawks&apos; and albatross&apos;, relative to body length. There are two species of giant petrel, both with circumpolar distributions, and both of which occur in New Zealand waters.</p>\n<p>The southern giant petrel is the largest petrel species, reaching the size of a small albatross. They are aggressive and opportunistic, scavenging penguin, albatross, seal and whale carrion, and ship offal, and preying on penguin and albatross chicks and other seabirds up to the size of an adult albatross. They also take fish and squid from the sea surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The southern giant petrel is the largest of all the petrel species, reaching the size of a small albatross but with shorter, narrower wings, and a more humpbacked shape. Two colour forms: white morph (c.10%) and dark morph (c.90%). White morph birds are white, usually sparsely flecked with black on the body and wings, and with dark brown eyes. Adult dark morph birds have a mainly dark grey-brown body with an off-white head, neck and upper breast. The wings are mottled greyish-brown with pale feathers along the leading edge. Their eyes are pale grey to whitish. Both morphs have a huge yellowish-horn bill with a pale green tip, and grey-brown legs. The sexes are similar, though males are 20% heavier, with larger bills. Juveniles of the dark morph are sooty black with a yellowish bill, with their plumage becoming paler with age.</p>\n<p>Voice: southern giant petrels make gutteral growling and whinnying calls during threat and courtship displays, snap their bills when threatened, and &quot;clack&quot; their bills during mating. They are noisy when feeding in flocks. Chicks make piping and quiet <em>peep</em> sounds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: dark morph southern giant petrels are very similar to northern giant petrels, with the colour of the bill tip (red-brown in northern, pale green in southern) the only character that is reliable for all age groups, especially the blackish juveniles. In the New Zealand region, adult northern giant petrels have pale feathering confined to their face, whereas adult southern giant petrels have pale heads, necks and upper breasts, contrasting with remaining dark plumage to create a two-toned look. Northern giant petrels elsewhere (i.e. South Atlantic) can have pale plumage from bill to undertail, but without the distinctly two-toned look of adult dark morph southern giant petrels. Sooty and light-mantled sooty albatrosses are slimmer and longer-tailed than giant petrels, and have black bills.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Southern giant petrels are pelagic and circumpolar, generally found between subantarctic and Antarctic latitudes from 40&#xB0;-68&#xB0;S, with breeding as far south as continental Antarctica. The closest breeding birds in the New Zealand region are 2,145 pairs at subantarctic Macquarie Island. Other island breeding sites (roughly east to west) include Heard, Kerguelen, Crozet, Prince Edward, Marion, Gough, Bouvet&#xF8;ya, South Georgia, South Orkney, South Sandwich, South Shetland, Falkland, Islas Diego Ramirez and Islas Noir.</p>\n<p>The at-sea ranges of the two giant petrel species overlap extensively. In summer, southern giant petrels range from subantarctic to Antarctic open oceans; in winter to early spring, they range throughout the Southern Ocean to subtropical waters as far north as Brazil in the South Atlantic. Adults stay relatively close to colonies during chick-rearing. Birds tracked from Macquarie Island foraged to the sea ice edge off Antarctica. Southern giant petrels are regularly recorded in New Zealand waters, including off Kaikoura Peninsula, and many banded birds have been recovered on New Zealand beaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The most recent estimated world population of southern giant petrels is 46,800 pairs and c.100,000 mature individuals. The largest colonies contain up to 5000 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The main threats to southern giant petrels are being caught and drowned on commercial longline fishing hooks, and fatal collisions with the heavy metal cables that attach trawl nets to commercial fishing vessels. Other marine threats include ingestion of marine plastic debris, oil spills and shooting by commercial fishers to reduce bait stealing. Between 2000 and 4000 giant petrels were estimated killed in illegal or unregulated longline fisheries in 1997-1998. Since then improved bycatch mitigation practices in some longline fisheries around breeding colonies, including South Georgia, have led to a reduction in observed bycatch of this species in these areas. Secondary mortality from ingested hooks and bycatch in illegal or unregulated fisheries may still be a threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Southern giant petrels start breeding from July, depending on latitude and location. They typically nest in loose colonies on low flats, gentle slopes or ridge tops in open vegetation but not in tussock (cf. northern giant petrel). Southern giant petrels build low bowls of tussock, moss, and small stones and bones, or sometimes scratched in grass, sand or rock. Southern giant petrels are monogamous, with shared incubation and chick care. The single large (106 x 66 mm) white egg is laid between August and November. Laying is earlier at lower latitudes. At mainland Antarctic sites, eggs are generally laid mid-October to mid-November over 21 days. Incubation takes c.60 days, with hatching from late October to late January. Young chicks are brooded and guarded for 24-26 days. Males feed chicks more frequently than females. Chicks fledge March to late May, 100&#x2013;130 days after hatching.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Aggressive and opportunistic, giant petrels (both species) are the main scavengers in subantarctic and Antarctic waters where they eat penguin, albatross, seal and whale carrion, ship offal and kelp. They also prey on small burrowing petrels, and take fish and squid by surface-seizing, surface-diving and pursuit plunging. Unusually for a petrel, adult birds walk strongly on land where they aggressively compete for carrion and prey along coastlines. They are capable of opening intact seal and whale carcasses on land and at sea, using their huge bill to make a hole. Once the hole is large enough, birds insert their bill and head into the carcass to access internal organs, often getting head and neck feathers coated in blood in the process, and earning the epithet &#x2019;sea vulture&#x2019; or &#x2018;vulture of the sea&#x2019;. The pecking order at carcasses is enforced with threat displays, with wings spread, tails raised and fanned, and the neck arched, and with the bill open and pointing downwards.</p>\n<p>Aerial displays are performed throughout the year. Courtship involves head-raising, bill-fencing, bill &quot;kissing&quot;, and mutual preening, accompanied by loud whinnying calls. Non-breeding southern giant petrels roost in groups of up to 100, on beaches and lakes, often with northern giant petrels. &#xA0;Skuas harass and prey on young giant petrel chicks. Adults and chicks defend themselves against predators by snapping the bill and squirting foul-smelling oily fluid secreted from the stomach through the mouth.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Southern giant petrels scavenge penguin, albatross, seal and whale carrion, and ship offal. They catch and kill penguin and albatross chicks and other seabirds up to the size of an adult albatross. They have been observed catching live seabirds on the wing and battering them to death against the sea surface before eating them. There is also an account of a southern giant petrel approaching a sleeping albatross, seizing it by the neck and forcing its head underwater until drowned, then eating it. Southern giant petrels are less attracted to fishing vessels than are northern giant petrels, but do take fish and squid by surface-seizing.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Giant_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Giant_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3870\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3870</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Harrison, P. 1987. <em>Seabirds of the world: a photographic guide</em>.

Although they resemble mollymawks and albatrosses, they are more closely related to five smaller fulmarine petrel species, including the Antarctic fulmar, Cape petrel and snow petrel. They have two large tube nostrils that are joined together on the top of the huge bill, in contrast to those of albatrosses which are smaller and separated, lying one on each side of the bill. Giant petrels&apos; wings are shorter than mollymawks&apos; and albatross&apos;, relative to body length. There are two species of giant petrel, both with circumpolar distributions, and both of which occur in New Zealand waters. The northern giant petrel breeds at four New Zealand subantarctic island groups, while the nearest breeding site of the southern giant petrel is Macquarie Island.</p>\n<p>An estimated 2,570 pairs of northern giant petrels breed in New Zealand annually, before dispersing to temperate and subtropical seas during winter. They are aggressive and opportunistic seabirds that scavenge penguin, albatross, seal and whale carrion, ship offal and kelp. They prey on penguin and albatross chicks and other seabirds up to the size of an adult albatross. They also take fish and squid from the sea surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Adult northern giant petrels have a mainly dark grey-brown body with a pale grey face (this pale grey extends to the neck, breast and belly in populations breeding in the South Atlantic). The eyes are pale grey to whitish and the bill is pinkish-yellow horn with a red-brown tip. The sexes look similar although males are markedly heavier with larger bills. The legs and feet are dark grey. Juveniles are dark sooty black with a yellowish bill, and become paler-headed with age. The traditional seafarers&apos; name for this species - &quot;stinkpot&quot; - is apt. Adult birds and chicks have an intense, foul smell like putrifying flesh.</p>\n<p>Voice: northern giant petrels whinny, growl and snap their bills when threatened. They are noisy when feeding in flocks. Chicks make piping sounds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the northern giant petrel and southern giant petrel have been recognised as separate species since 1966, when it was realised that they bred alongside each other on Macquarie Island, with different breeding schedules and no hybridisation. Around 10% of southern giant petrels are a distinctive white morph (with sparse black feathers and brown eyes) &#x2013; a colour form not found in the northern giant petrel. Adult dark morph southern giant petrels are usually paler than adult northern giant petrel, with the southern birds having a distinctly two-toned appearance, with the pale head, neck and breast contrasting with the remaining dark plumage. Southern giant petrels have a pale green tip to the bill (cf. red-brown in northern giant petrel), and this is the only way to separate the all-dark juveniles of northern giant petrel and dark morph southern giant petrel. Sooty and light-mantled sooty albatrosses are slimmer and longer-tailed than giant petrels, and have black bills.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Northern giant petrels are pelagic and circumpolar, generally found between 30-64&#xB0;S. In summer they range from subantarctic to Antarctic open oceans; in winter to early spring they range throughout subtropical seas to 28&#xB0;S. Adults stay relatively close to colonies during chick-rearing. In New Zealand they breed at the Auckland, Campbell, Antipodes and Chatham Islands; they formerly bred in small numbers at Port Pegasus, Stewart Island. Within the Chatham Islands they breed only on The Sisters and Forty Fours islands. Elsewhere, northern giant petrels breed on South Georgia, Prince Edward Islands, Crozet and Kerguelen Islands, and Macquarie Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The world population of northern giant petrels was recently estimated at between 11,000 and 14,000 pairs. There were c.2000 pairs at the Forty Fours and 80-100 pairs at Middle Sister in the Chatham Islands, 230 pairs at Antipodes Island, 230 pairs at Campbell Island and 50 pairs at the Auckland Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The main threats to northern giant petrels are being caught and drowned on commercial longline fishing hooks, and fatal collisions with the heavy metal cables that attach trawl nets to commercial fishing vessels. Other marine threats include eating marine plastic debris, oil spills and shooting by commercial fishers to reduce bait stealing. Between 2000 and 4000 giant petrels were estimated killed in illegal or unregulated longline fisheries in 1997-1998. Since then improved bycatch mitigation practices in some longline fisheries around breeding colonies, including South Georgia, have led to a reduction in observed bycatch of this species in these areas. Secondary mortality from ingested hooks and bycatch in illegal or unregulated fisheries may still be a threat. At the Chatham Islands, fisheries bycatch returned by observers from New Zealand waters between 1996 and 2005 reported 17 birds.</p>\n<p>The IUCN Red List classifies the northern giant petrel as Least Concern; the Department of Conservation classifies it as At Risk/Recovering.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Northern giant petrel colonies range from 10 to 280 nests, spaced 3-5 m apart. The nest bowl is built of twigs, tussock, leaves and stalks, and is placed at low altitude on densely vegetated ground. The breeding season in New Zealand runs from August to February. Northern giant petrel breed as monogamous pairs, with shared incubation and chick-rearing. The single large (102 x 66 mm) white egg is laid in August or September. Incubation takes c.60 days, after which chicks are brooded for 2-3 weeks then guarded for a further 2 weeks; males undertake the larger part of incubation and guard duty. The chicks fledge in February when about 112 days old. The average age of first breeding is around 10 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Aggressive and opportunistic, giant petrels (both species) are the main scavengers in subantarctic and Antarctic waters where they eat penguin, albatross, seal and whale carrion, along with live prey (see below). Unusually for a petrel, adult birds walk strongly on land where they aggressively compete for carrion and prey; they are the only petrels that will feed while on land. They are capable of opening large intact seal and whale carcasses on land and at sea, using their huge bill to make a hole. Once the hole is large enough they insert the bill and head into the carcass to access internal organs, often blooding the head and neck feathers in the process, hence the old mariners&apos; name of &quot;sea vulture&quot;. The pecking order at carcasses is enforced with threat displays, with wings spread, tail raised and fanned, neck arched, and bill held open and pointing downward. Birds also congregate when washing and preening.</p>\n<p>During the breeding season, males scavenge around seal and penguin colonies and have coastal distribution, while the 20% smaller females are more dependent on pelagic food sources taken at the surface. Northern giant petrels are more strongly attracted to fishing vessels than are southern giant petrels. Non-breeding birds roost in groups of up to 100 birds, on beaches, lakes, and open tussock, often with southern giant petrels. Subantarctic skuas harass and prey on young giant petrel chicks. Adults and chicks defend themselves against predators by snapping the bill and squirting a foul-smelling oily fluid secreted from the stomach through the mouth.</p>\n<p>During courtship, birds preen, sway and call. Birds&apos; bills touch rapidly, creating a clicking sound. Males open wings and extend them fully. Aerial displays are also performed, with a high-pitched whinny given by birds in a slow glide over the nesting area, with the head raised and neck arched.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Northern giant petrels scavenge corpses of birds and mammals (on beaches and at sea), and take fishing waste and some kelp. They prey on penguin and albatross chicks, and also kill and eat other seabirds up to the size of an adult albatross. Northern giant petrels also take fish and squid by surface-seizing, surface-diving and pursuit plunging down to 2 metres.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3871\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3871</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Harrison, P. 1987. <em>Seabirds of the world: a photographic guide</em>.

Dark morph birds (also known as &apos;blue morph&apos;) are most likely to reach New Zealand seas, as they are the predominant morph at lower latitudes in the North Pacific. They are entirely dark grey (some with a pale patch at the base of the primaries on the upper wing), though even the darkest birds are paler than other dark petrels or shearwaters of a similar size (e.g. flesh-footed shearwater). Plumage becomes browner when worn. The feet are dull pinkish-grey, and the bill is pale bluish-grey (or pale pinkish yellow) with a darker orange-yellow terminal hook, often separated from the rest of the bill by a narrow blackish band. Moulting birds, or those in faded plumage can have blotched dark-and-pale plumage quite unlike other petrels (though compare with Cape petrel). Pale morph birds have a small dark patch in front of the eye on an otherwise white head, with underparts including underwings also white; the silver-grey upperwings have a whitish panel at the base of the darker primaries. The bill is usually pinker than in dark morph birds, with the black subterminal ring reduced or absent; legs and feet pale pinkish-grey. Intermediate colour morphs occur in a continuous gradation. The wings are broad and rounded, with a span of 100-110 cm. Pacific birds (<em>F.g. rodgersii</em>) have relatively smaller heads and more slender bills than low-latitude Atlantic birds (<em>F.g. auduboni</em>).</p>\n<p>Voice: Northern fulmars make grunting and chuckling noises when in a flock squabbling over a rich food source. The main call at colonies is a raucous cackling.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Similar species: pale morph northern fulmars looks similar to Antarctic fulmars, but they have different coloured bills (Antarctic fulmar has pink bill with blue nasal tubes and black terminal hook). Dark morph northern fulmars are generally paler than dark shearwaters of a similar size, and have larger heads, broader wings and more stocky bodies. White-chinned petrel is darker, and the bill is paler without the deeper yellow terminal hook. Dark morph northern fulmar may appear similar to an immature southern black-backed gull, but the latter has a dark bill of different structure, and northern fulmar is stockier with a thicker neck. The smaller fulmarine petrels (including both fulmar species and Cape petrel) fly with distinctive shallow wingbeats and straight wings, quite unlike other petrels and shearwaters.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The northern fulmar is abundant in cold temperate and polar seas in the northern hemisphere, with <em>F.g. rodgersii</em> breeding at numerous cliff sites in eastern Siberia (Kurile, Commander, Kamchatka, Wrangel, Pribiloff, St Lawrence Islands and adjacent coasts), Aleutian Islands and Alaskan Peninsula. Outside the May-September northern summer breeding season, the at-sea distribution extends to Japan and Baja California south to about 34&#xB0; N (exceptionally to 22&#xB0; N, Mexico). A bird photographed off Valparaiso, Chile, on 11 February 2017 was the second record of this species from the Southern Hemisphere.</p>\n<p>The northern fulmar has been recorded within 17 km of the North Pole, further north than any other petrel.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>A single record of a bird photographed at sea east of the Snares Islands in February 2014 (first Southern Hemisphere record).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The northern fulmar has a very large range and an increasing population estimated at more than 20 million individuals. It is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. </p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Northern fulmars are highly sociable birds, and often feed and rest in large flocks. Large congregations of birds, often mixed with other seabirds, such as shearwaters and kittiwakes, gather around food concentrations at sea. They are the most common ship-following species in the northern North Pacific, often in vast flocks, and are noisy and aggressive while feeding in large congregations.</p>\n<p>Breeding is highly colonial, in shallow holes or broad ledges on cliffs. During courtship displays paired birds touch bills, wave heads, and preen together, while calling loudly. Adults defend the nest from intruders by lunging forward with wide open bill, and cackling loudly.

However, its flight is more like that of an albatross, flapping, gliding and soaring over the waves on long stiff wings. It is a circumpolar colonial breeder on the coasts of Antarctica and adjacent glaciated islands, including Balleny, South Sandwich, South Orkney, South Shetland and Bouvet&#xF8;ya. Antarctic fulmars nest on cliff ledges up to 200 m above the sea; along with the Cape petrel and Antarctic petrel (which often nest nearby), it is among the few petrel species that&#xA0;are true cliff-nesters. Antarctic fulmars range across the Southern Ocean. In summer it is one of the commonest birds of circumpolar pack ice. Its winter range extends well north of Antarctica into subtropical seas, including New Zealand waters, and it sometimes reaches tropical waters off the coast of South America.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Antarctic fulmar has a white head, pale silver-grey neck and mantle grading to darker grey on the upperwings and back, and black wing tips with rectangular skua-like white flashes towards the tips. The underwings and tail are white, and the tail fans out to a wedge during flight. The pink bill has a black hooked tip with bluish nasal tubes on top. The eyes are dark and the feet pinkish. The wings are quite broad and rounded, with a combined span of 110-120 cm.</p>\n<p>Voice: Antarctic fulmars are usually silent at sea. They make loud cackling or rattling calls and a repeated <em>kew-kew-kew </em>call at the nest and in feeding flocks; their calls are similar to those of the Cape petrel. Chicks make begging <em>che-che</em> calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Antarctic fulmar looks similar to the northern fulmar of the Northern Hemisphere, which has been recorded once in New Zealand (and the Southern Hemisphere). Antarctic fulmar differs in always being pale (no dark morph), and having a predominantly pink bill with a black tip. It is distinguished from white-headed petrel by its paler bill and white underwings.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Antarctic fulmar is a circumpolar colonial breeder along the coast of Antarctica and adjacent glaciated islands, including Balleny, South Sandwich, South Orkney, South Shetland, and Bouvet&#xF8;ya. During the breeding season, fulmars forage in pack ice around Antarctica and breeding islands. They are highly nomadic outside the breeding season, moving north away from the pack ice, to open water off the coasts of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and South America to central Chile and southern Brazil. The Antarctic fulmar is a regular winter straggler to New Zealand seas, mainly during May-December. Small numbers are beach-wrecked on the New Zealand mainland most years, rising to over 600 in 1975. They have been recorded off the North Island in seas off Auckland and the Bay of Plenty, but are most regularly reported at sea off&#xA0;Kaikoura Peninsula, where an exceptional 24 birds were seen together in 2005.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of Antarctic fulmars is estimated at 4 million birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The Antarctic fulmar has a very large range and a large, stable population, and is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Extreme weather kills 40% of eggs and 25% of chicks. Some local populations may be affected by the effects of climate change in future. Antarctic birds seem to be breeding later in response to a reduction in the extent of sea-ice cover, causing decreases in prey species in some areas, or the increasing length of the sea-ice season, which delays access to breeding grounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Antarctic fulmars return to their colonial breeding grounds from October. Paired birds tend to stay together each season, and are monogamous with shared incubation and chick care. Antarctic fulmars have difficulty taking off from land, preferring to build nests on rock ledges and in cavities on cliffs and steep rocky slopes. The nest is a gravel-lined scrape on a ledge or crevice with shelter from the wind. The single large (76 x 50 mm) white egg is laid in December. Incubation takes 46-47 days, and the chick is brooded and guarded for 14-20 days after hatching. Chicks fledge in March, 50-52 days after hatching.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Antarctic fulmars are highly sociable birds, and often feed and rest in large flocks. Large congregations of birds, often mixed with other seabirds, such as Cape petrels, gather around food concentrations at sea. They are noisy and aggressive while feeding in large congregations. Breeding is highly colonial. During courtship displays paired birds touch bills, wave heads, and preen together, while calling loudly. Skuas harass and prey on weak chicks. Adults defend the nest from intruder birds by lunging forward with wide open bill. Adults and chicks sometimes squirt foul-smelling stomach oils at intruders (fulmars, skuas or humans) when alarmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Antarctic fulmars consume krill, fish and squid, with proportions varying locally. They sometimes take small sick birds, and scavenge discarded offal and refuse from fishing and whaling vessels. Food is taken by surface-seizing, surface-skimming and shallow dives.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Fulmar\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Fulmar</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3873\">www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3873</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Barbraud, C.; Weimerskirch, H. 2006.

They occasionally stray as far north as New Zealand in winter, where they are most likely to be found storm-wrecked on the North Island west coast and on Southland beaches. A remarkable influx to New Zealand waters in 1978 led to hundreds being seen around Fiordland and Stewart Island, and 77 were picked up dead on beaches. The next largest wreck of 19 birds occurred in 1991.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Antarctic petrel is an unmistakable species, with bold, clean markings that are quite unlike those of any other petrel species. In fresh plumage the head, nape, back, rump, tail tip and leading half of the upperwings are chocolate brown, contrasting with the white trailing half of the wing and the mainly white tail. The underparts are white, apart from the brown throat and thin leading edge to the underwing. The brown feathers fade in the continuous Antarctic summer sun, so that birds are pale-brown-and-white by the end of the breeding season. Antarctic petrels glide on stiffly held wings, and flap less often than the speckled-backed Cape petrel, which is the only possible confusion species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Antarctic petrels are one of the characteristic birds of the Antarctic pack-ice, occurring all around the continent, and especially in the Ross and Weddell Seas. They breed on ice-free rocky peaks and cliff faces on the Antarctic mainland, and on a few islands within the Antarctic icefields. Some breeding sites are on sea cliffs, while others are up to 350 km inland and 1600 m above sea level. &#xA0;Antarctic petrels mainly feed among pack-ice, and often rest on pack-ice and icebergs. They occasionally range further north, reaching southern South America, South Africa, southern Australia, Macquarie Island and New Zealand, including Chatham and Snares Islands.</p>\n<p>Population estimates range as high as 10-20 million individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>The first New Zealand record of an Antarctic petrel was one storm-wrecked in September 1973, followed by three in 1975 and one in 1977. These were followed by the phenomenal influx of September 1978, when 77 were found. Subsequent wrecks have occurred in 1987 (9 birds), 1991 (19), 1992 (8), 1995 (8) and 1999 (10), with most birds found August to October. Most Antarctic petrels have been found on west coast beaches between Wellington and Cape Reinga, with high encounter rates also on Southland beaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Antarctic petrel are highly gregarious, both in single-species and mixed-species flocks. They are attracted to ships, where they either fly high over the superstructure, or join the Cape petrels and Antarctic fulmars around the stern and under the bow. They often accompany minke and humpback whales. Flocks of up to 6000 formerly occurred around whaling vessels in Antarctic waters.</p>\n<p>Antarctic petrels breed in dense colonies on cliff ledges and among rockfields, mainly on slopes kept free of snow by exposure to wind. Colonies up to 200,000 pairs can have densities greater than 1 nest per m2. Antarctic petrels often breed in mixed colonies with Antarctic fulmars, Cape petrels and snow petrels. Courting birds give a hen-like clucking, and throw their heads back until the top of the head almost touches their back. The single white egg (70 x 49 mm) is laid in a shallow, stone-lined bowl in late November or early December. Both parents share incubation (40-48 days) and chick-rearing (42-47 days). Eggs hatch in early January and chicks fledge in late February.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Antarctic petrels consume krill and other small crustaceans, small squid and fish obtained by surface-seizing, or plunge-diving up to 1.5 metres. They also take krill from the top of ice-floes when they are washed there by ship-wake.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3874\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3874</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Barlow, M. 1979.

They frequent New Zealand coastal waters, especially south from Cook Strait, and are familiar ship followers and scavengers around commercial fishing vessels.</p>\n<p>Known widely as &#x201C;Pintado petrel&#xB4; this species is common in cooler seas all around the southern hemisphere. Two subspecies are recognised &#x2013; the Cape petrel <em>D. c. capense</em>, which breeds on mainland Antarctic and Antarctic Peninsula and Antarctic and subantarctic islands outside of New Zealand and the Snares Cape petrel <em>D. c. australe </em>which breeds on the Snares, Bounty, Antipodes, Auckland and Chatham Islands in the New Zealand region.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The head, neck and mantle of the Cape petrel are black; the lower back, base of the upperwing and rump are white, heavily chequered with black, whilst the outer upperwings are black with broad white patches near the body and beyond the bend in the wing. The underparts are white; the underwings are also white, but with a black leading edge. The bill, legs and feet are black.</p>\n<p>Voice: Cape petrels are noisy at sea when squabbling for food and at the nest, where they give cackling and chirring calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: The subspecies are separated by the extent of white on the upperparts. Snares Cape petrels have less white on the upperparts. They are only likely to be confused with Antarctic petrels, which have a similar strongly patterned plumage, but are clean-cut chocolate brown and white rather than the chequered and spotted black and white of the Cape petrel.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>During the breeding season (November-February) Cape petrels occur throughout coastal New Zealand, especially from Cook Strait south and out to the Chatham Islands. After breeding they still occur around New Zealand and there is an influx of Cape petrels from mainland Antarctica, Antarctic islands and other subantarctic islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Snares Cape petrels breed on the Snares, Bounty, Antipodes, Auckland and Chatham Islands and there was an estimated total population of 5,000-10,000 breeding pairs before 1984. However, the total population at the Snares Islands was estimated at 7,385 breeding pairs in 1984, and so the population may have increased over that time.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The majority of breeding sites are free from mammalian predators. Occasionally Cape petrels are reported as by-catch in longline and trawl fisheries.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Cape petrels breed in loose colonies. They are monogamous with shared incubation and chick care. The nest is a scrape lined with rock fritter obtained from the immediate vicinity of the nest. Pairs tend to return to the same site year after year. The single large (61 x 43 mm) white egg is laid in November. Incubation takes about 45 days; chicks are fed by regurgitation, fledge at about 52 days, and are independent at fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Cape petrels are gregarious both at sea and when breeding. At sea, they may form large dense flocks, gathering for food around fishing vessels or swarms of crustaceans, where they are both noisy and quarrelsome. At their breeding colonies they use an elaborate series of displays and calls to maintain their pair bond and to defend their nest scrape. Cape petrels are annual breeders that usually return to the same nest site year after year with the same partner. Immediately after breeding the colonies are deserted as the birds undergo moult around the breeding islands. Afterwards they return to the breeding colonies during the day at least, spending increasing time ashore from July on. In the New Zealand region the longest interval between banding and recapture is 27 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Cape petrels mainly eat krill and amphipods, plus small fish and squid, and offal from fishing vessels taken from the surface. They rarely plunge or dive for food.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3875\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3875</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It is the only petrel species with pure white plumage, providing it with good camouflage in Antarctica. In contrast, it has a short, narrow, hooked blue-black bill, dark brown eyes and blue-black feet. It has relatively long wings and a wedge-shaped tail.</p>\n<p>Along with South Polar skua, the snow petrel has the southernmost breeding range of any bird species, and is one of only three species recorded at the South Pole. It is a circumpolar breeder in Antarctica, nesting up to 440 km inland in the Antarctic mountains, and up to 2,400 m above sea level. It also breeds on glaciated islands, including the Balleny Islands and Scott Islands in the Ross Dependency, and South Georgia, South Orkney and the South Sandwich Islands, and Bouvet&#xF8;ya Island, in the South Atlantic Ocean. Its life-cycle is closely linked to pack ice: drifting sea ice that becomes packed together in large masses. Birds occur mainly in areas of sea with 10-50% ice cover, are rarely recorded at sea north of 55&#xB0;S, and have never been recorded around the New Zealand mainland.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The snow petrel is a small fulmarine petrel with pure white plumage, a short narrow hooked blue-black bill, dark eyes and bluish-black feet. It has relatively long wings (75-95 cm), and a wedge-shaped tail when fanned in flight. The sexes are alike, with the male usually slightly larger; juveniles are distinguished by extensive black barring on upperparts. Snow petrels are agile fliers, flying low when over water, using more rapid wing-beats and less gliding than other petrels. Pronounced differences in size are reported between individuals, with the largest adult birds around one quarter larger than the smallest.</p>\n<p>Voice: adults cluck, screech and chirr. They have harsh gutteral calls, including a high pitched <em>kir-kir-kir</em>, and make plaintive calls during mating. Chicks <em>chirrup </em>when parents arrive at the nest.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the only other all-white bird in Antarctica is the snowy sheathbill (absent from the Ross Sea sector), which is distinguished by its bulkier body, larger head and yellow bill, and land-based life-cycle. Antarctic and Arctic terns in Antarctic seas are distinguished by black caps and red bills. White morph southern giant petrels are at least 8 x the size of the largest snow petrels (by weight), with huge pale yellowish-horn bills, and always have a few scattered black feathers.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Snow petrels are confined to Antarctica and neighbouring glaciated islands, including the Balleny Islands and Scott Islands in the Ross Dependency, and South Georgia, South Orkney and the South Sandwich Islands, and Bouvet&#xF8;ya Island, in the South Atlantic Ocean. In October 1994, two birds were recorded as vagrants at sea 180 nautical miles south-west of Australian-administered Macquarie Island. In 1994 and 1995, two dead birds were recovered on Macquarie Island, which lies 650-700 km south-west of Auckland and Campbell Islands in the New Zealand subantarctic region.</p>\n<p>The snow petrel has a circumpolar distribution in Antarctic waters, from the edge of the pack-ice to the continental ice-shelf. Occasionally birds flock in open water where icebergs are present, where they are often seen roosting on icebergs. During the austral winter they disperse to pack ice, ice floes and open seas, when seas nearest breeding sites are frozen. Birds recorded at South Georgia are always near drifting ice offshore&#xA0;or at the heads of glaciers.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There is an estimated total global population of 4 million adult snow petrels.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most abundant bird species of the Antarctic region, the IUCN Red List classifies the snow petrel as Least Concern. Climate change may threaten the species in future because Antarctic birds seem to be breeding later in response to a reduction in the extent of sea ice cover, causing decreases in prey species in some areas, or the increasing length of the sea ice season, which delays access to breeding grounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The snow petrel is a circumpolar, loosely colonial annual breeder south of the Antarctic Convergence, on glaciated islands and continental Antarctica. Colonies in the Theron Mountains are up to 440 km inland from the coast, and at altitudes up to 2,400 m above sea level. It nests where rock is exposed during summer, under overhangs, or in crevices and small caves. Birds perform aerial displays year-round. Courtship involves head-raising, bill-fencing, bill &quot;kissing&quot;, and mutual preening. Some birds stay at colonies year-round, with the main influx mid-September to early November. Snow petrels are monogamous with long-lasting pair bonds, and shared incubation and chick care. A single white egg (56 x 40 mm) is laid between late November and mid-December. Nests are pebble-lined scrapes on snow-free rock ledges with overhanging protection or in&#xA0;deep rock crevices. Incubation takes 41-49 days, with eggs hatching in January. Chicks fledge between late February and mid-May, 41-45 days after hatching.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Snow petrels are loosely gregarious at sea and when breeding. Flocks show no coordinated flying movements; individuals have agile, erratic, bat-like flight. Snow petrels nesting south of the Antarctic Circle experience continuous daylight in the middle of their breeding cycle; even then, they concentrate their activity at the breeding colonies when the sun is lowest in the sky. Snow petrels are not truly colonial because nests are often sparsely scattered among large concentrations in suitable habitat. Nests are often associated with those of other fulmarine petrels (Antarctic fulmar, Antarctic petrel, Cape petrel), which compete for the same limited ice-free space. The snow petrel is more of a crevice nester than the three larger ledge-nesting species. At the nest, an occupying bird may squirt foul-smelling orange stomach oils at intruders (other snow petrels, skuas or humans) via the open mouth, and fight off other snow petrels using its bill and wings. Birds stained with oil from such fighting gather on snow banks near nesting sites to clean their feathers in snow. Snow petrels may live up to 20 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Snow petrels feeds mainly on krill, squid and fish, and scavenge carrion such as bird, seal and whale carcasses. Food is taken by aerial and contact dipping, surface-diving, surface-seizing and pursuit diving, and sometimes pursuit plunging with open wings. While surface-seizing, birds sometimes peck the sea surface continuously while rotating their bodies with their webbed feet, like a phalarope. Feeding birds sometimes accompany minke whales and Antarctic petrels.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Petrel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Petrel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3876\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3876</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Barbraud, C.; Weimerskirch, H. 2006.

The most familiar New Zealand species is the pukeko. Rails are seldom seen to fly any great distance, however some species undertake long migrations. At one time or another most oceanic islands have been colonised by rails, many forms of which subsequently became flightless, as have weka and takahe in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The most migratory of all the rails is the corncrake, a medium-sized rail that breeds from central Europe east to Mongolia and migrates to southern Africa in the non-breeding season. There is a single historical record from New Zealand, and two from Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The corncrake is a typical rail, with a large body and strong legs. The plumage is mostly buffy with blackish brown streaking on the back; the face is grey with a buff streak through the eye. The corncrake is superficially like a weka but is generally much more secretive and usually only seen when flushed, when the uniform chestnut-coloured wings are distinctive.</p>\n<p>Voice: in the breeding season a distinctive c<em>rex-crex </em>is often given at dusk and night.</p>\n<p>Similar species: weka is much larger (length 53 cm) and flightless.

First discovered in the second half of the 19th century, the species went undetected between 1893 and 1966 when it was rediscovered on Adams Island. In 1993 it was found on Disappointment Island. It must have originally occurred on all the islands in the Auckland Islands group but vegetation changes caused by pigs and predation by cats has eliminated it from the main Auckland Island, and the former presence of cattle, rabbits and mice probably explain its absence from Enderby Island. It inhabits dense vegetation and is very secretive, but quite vocal &#x2013; being much more often heard than seen. It is the only rail resident on the Auckland Islands and when a good sighting is made it cannot be confused with anything else. If however, it is only glimpsed (as it most often is) then it can be confused with the similar-sized subantarctic snipe.</p>\n<p>Its closest relative is Lewin&#x2019;s rail from Australia which is very similar in appearance but a little larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The Auckland Island rail is a small rail with a reddish-brown head and neck, brown and black back, grey breast, and black-and-white barred flanks and undertail. The bill is red with a grey tip and the legs are grey-brown.</p>\n<p>Voice: a characteristic and loud <em>kek-kek-kek</em>&#x2026;. call and a variety of quiet calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the only species with which the Auckland Island rail might be confused is the similar-sized subantarctic snipe which occurs everywhere the rail does. The snipe has a much longer bill, a buff-and-brown striped head, and plain (unbarred) flanks and undertail. The snipe is less furtive and slower moving than the rail, and readily flushes if disturbed at close range (the rail never does).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island rails are known only from Adams (10,000 ha) and Disappointment (280 ha) Islands in the Auckland Islands group. They undoubtedly once occurred on most of the islands in the group, but vegetation changes caused by pigs and cattle, predation by cats and perhaps competition from mice has eliminated them from the main Auckland Island (51,000 ha) and Enderby Island (600 ha). They may still occur on some smaller islands in the group, but they have not been detected on any of them.</p>\n<p>On both Adams and Disappointment Islands they are most often found in dense vegetation about 1 m high comprising tussocks, large herbs and sedges, at sites from sea level to about 450 m a.s.l. On Adams Island they sometimes also occur in short (2.5 m high) forest which has a dense understory of ferns and sedges.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are probably about 1500 Auckland Island rails, of which about 95% occur on Adams Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>There are no threats to the rails on Adams and Disappointment Islands which have no introduced predators. However, rails have disappeared from islands in the Auckland Islands group that have (or have had) pigs, cats and mice, but it is not clear which of these introduced mammals was responsible for the rail&#x2019;s demise. There is a risk that any of these mammals might eventually cross the narrow gap between the main Auckland Island and Adams Island and lead to the extinction of the rails there. There is also a risk that rats might arrive on the islands from an illegal landing or shipwreck.</p>\n<p>The Auckland Islands are nature reserves with strictly controlled access.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Probably spring and summer breeders, though only one active nest has ever been found (in November). The only known clutch contained 2 eggs. Nests are woven of grasses and sedges, about 20 cm above the ground and concealed from above by vegetation.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Island rails appear to be territorial, sedentary and diurnal. They spend all their time in the cover of dense vegetation and very rarely fly.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Unknown, but probably almost entirely invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands_Rail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands_Rail</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2875\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2875</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nzbirds.com/birds/railaucklandisland.html\">http://nzbirds.com/birds/railaucklandisland.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Elliott, G.P.; Buckingham, R.P.; Walker, K.J. 1991.

They are now mainly found in mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation in the upper North Island. They have disappeared from most of New Zealand since the 1970s, but remain in coastal wetlands in the upper North Island, Marlborough and Nelson, in rush-covered areas and coastal wetlands on Great Barrier Island and in forest and shrubland on the Three Kings Islands and on four islands off Stewart Island.</p>\n<p>Banded rail (also known as buff-banded rail) subspecies are found on the Cocos Islands (Indian Ocean), Indonesia, Philippines, Melanesia, western Polynesia, Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p>The banded rail is a medium-sized, intricately patterned rail. The crown and back are olive-brown, with the back streaked with black and finely spotted with white. A pale grey eyebrow stripe and cheeks and throat are separated by a rufous eye-stripe that runs from the bill back to the rufous nape. A broad buff-orange band lies across the breast, and is separated from the grey throat by a narrow band of black-and-white barring. This barring continues around and below the buff breast band, becoming bold zebra stripes on the belly. The long, stout bill is reddish-brown, the eye dark-red, and the legs pinkish-brown. Immature birds are duller with a dark bill and legs, Nestlings are sooty black, with black feet and bill.</p>\n<p>Voice: a <em>swit</em> contact call and a cackling alarm call, most often heard in the early mornings and evenings.</p>\n<p>Similar species: in the northern South Island, the larger weka may overlap with banded rail, and throughout its range the much smaller marsh crake is also found in dense coastal rushes. Weka are 3-6 times larger, with much more subdued markings, lacking any black-and-white barring. The tiny marsh crake has no rufous eye-stripe, plain blue-grey from the cheeks to the lower breast, and black-and-white barring is confined to behind the legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>In the North Island, banded rail is restricted to mangroves and saltmarshes in the estuaries of Northland, Auckland, Waikato and Bay of Plenty. In the South Island it is restricted to large saltmarshes in Nelson and Marlborough. It is common on Great Barrier Island in mangroves, saltmarshes, the dry edges of freshwater wetlands and rush-covered pasture. It is also found on the Three Kings Islands and weka-free islands off south-western Stewart Island (Pohowaitai and Kaimohu, reintroduced to Kundy) and Little Solander Island. Occasional records in North Taranaki, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, Wairarapa and Stewart Island probably reflect their ability to move large distances from breeding areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>About 80-90% of the New Zealand population is found around estuaries in the upper North Island, with probably another 200 birds in Nelson/Marlborough. Home range estimates range from 1.5ha/pair in Nelson saltmarshes to 4 hectare/pair in Northland mangroves.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Inland populations in the North and South Islands declined by the 1930s. In the Waikato, banded rail were commonly seen in the drier rush wetlands around Hamilton in the 1950s. Banded rail were recorded inland occasionally in the New Zealand Wildlife Service&#x2019;s National Fauna Surveys in the 1970s e.g. Whangamarino wetland (Waikato) and Waitakere wetland (Auckland), but they were absent from these habitats by the 1980s, and are now absent inland. This period also coincided with extensive wetland drainage nationally and the failure of fitch-farming where there was widespread release of ferrets. Their current habitat on mustelid-free Great Barrier Island is in mangroves, salt and brackish marshes, drier freshwater wetlands and rough pasture. This probably reflects 19th century rail habitats on mainland New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Banded rail (known locally as mioweka) became extinct on many muttonbird islands off Stewart Island (including Jacky Lee, Herekopare, Kundy, Solomon and Big South Cape) following releases of weka or cats, or invasion by ship rats. Mioweka were reintroduced to Kundy Island in 1999 following eradication of weka there. Macquarie Island rail was extirpated before 1890 following introduction of cats and weka. The conservation status of this species was changed from naturally uncommon to declining in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Banded rail breed in spring and summer, constructing a rough platform of rush and reed fragments, usually in jointed rush thickets between 10 and 50 cm above ground or water. The 4-6 eggs are pale pinkish with dark blotches of brown and grey, and are incubated for 19-25 days. Graeme Elliott found in Nelson/Marlborough that 38 eggs in eight clutches produced 13 chicks that left the nest, with an average of 1.6 young per nest.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Banded rail are reluctant, but strong fliers that can travel considerable distances, mainly at night. They occasionally appear far from their normal breeding range; many of these observations are juveniles moving about in autumn. They typically stay in dense vegetation and forage no more than 6 metres from the vegetation edge. Rail have distinctive calls, but often don&apos;t respond to playback of taped calls.</p>\n<p>In the northern North Island rails spend 75% of their time feeding under mangrove cover, moving into this habitat as soon as the tide recedes. The remaining time is spent being in rushes, tall grass and shrubland in the upper reaches of estuaries, when the tide is in. In Nelson/Marlborough they are limited to large areas of salt marshes in the upper tidal zone. They seldom venture into the open, and then mainly at dawn and dusk.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Banded rails consume snails, crabs, insects, worms and spiders. They also feed on dead fish, seeds and fruit when available. They are suspected of piercing and consuming seabird eggs on muttonbird islands, but the behaviour has not been observed directly. Most feeding is in the morning and evening, and along the water&apos;s edge as the tide recedes.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff-banded_Rail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff-banded_Rail</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/9\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/9</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bellingham, M. 2012.

He recorded that &#x201C;A new kind of rail was formerly very common; but, since cats and dogs have been introduced, it has become very scarce. The natives call this bird meriki, and catch it with nooses. I often heard its short, shrill voice in the bush, and after much trouble, obtained a living specimen.&#x201D; This specimen was sent to the British Museum where it was named in his honour. No further live birds were ever reported, and Dieffenbach&#x2019;s rail is considered to have become extinct soon after 1840.</p>\n<p>Ancient DNA studies have shown Dieffenbach&#x2019;s rail to be closely related to the Mangere Rail, another species that was restricted to the Chatham Islands.

The crown and nape were dark rusty brown and there was a chestnut brown stripe through the eye, tapering behind. The chin, throat and a long stripe above the eye were grey. The back feathers and those on the breast were yellowish-brown banded with black. The fore neck and belly were black barred with white, and the under-tail was black with reddish brown markings. The primaries were chestnut banded with black, and the tail was dark rusty brown. The bill was light brown, darker toward the tip, the legs and feet light brown, and the eye reddish brown.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Bone deposits reveal that Dieffenbach&#x2019;s rail occurred on Chatham, Pitt and Mangere Islands (at least), in forest and along coastlines.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Dieffenbach&#x2019;s rails were already declining rapidly when discovered in 1840.

Likely derived from a flighted ancestor, weka are 3-6 times larger than banded rails, which are considered their nearest flying relatives.&#xA0;Weka are charismatic birds that are often attracted to human activity. This makes an encounter with a weka a wildlife highlight for many people, as the curious bird searches for any food item that the intruder might bring. But people who live alongside weka often have a less charitable opinion, as they have to live with ever-watchful weka snatching opportunities to raid vegetable gardens, pilfer poultry food and eggs, and even steal dog food from the bowl. Unfortunately weka are not as robust as they appear, and have become extinct over large tracts of the mainland. Causes of extinction are complex, and are likely to be due to interactions between climatic conditions (especially drought) and predator numbers (especially ferrets, stoats&#xA0;and dogs). Fortunately, weka still thrive at many accessible sites, including on Kawau, Mokoia, Kapiti, Ulva and Chatham Islands, the Marlborough Sounds, North Westland, and parts of the Abel Tasman, Heaphy and Milford Tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The weka is a large flightless rail that can have extremely variable plumage. Most birds are predominantly mid-brown, those on the Chatham Islands are tawny, those from Stewart Island are chestnut, and a proportion in Fiordland and on some islands near Stewart Island are almost black. Most birds have their dorsal feathers streaked with black, and all have their longest wing and tail feathers boldly barred with black. As adults, all have red eyes, a strong pointed bill and strong legs. North Island birds are predominantly grey-breasted with grey bills and brown legs. Western, Stewart Island and buff weka (the latter on Chatham Islands) can vary from having a grey to brown-grey breast with a wide brown breast-band, and having grey to pink bills and brown to pink legs. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice: spacing calls are generally given at dawn and in the half hour after sunset. They are a characteristic <em>coo..eet</em> given as a duet by members of a pair, with the male call lower and slower than the female. Other calls include booming, and soft clucking contact calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the banded rail is much smaller and more boldly marked, including a rufous eye-stripe on an otherwise pale grey face, a broad orange breast band, and underparts boldly barred with black-and-white. Female common pheasants have smaller heads, shorter bills, much longer tails, and will fly if pressed.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Weka strongholds include Russell Peninsula, Kawakawa Bay and Opotiki-Motu in the North Island, and the Marlborough Sounds, North-west Nelson, the West Coast north of Ross, and Fiordland in the South Island. Also many islands including Kawau, Rakitu, Pakatoa, Rotoroa, Mokoia, Kapiti, D&#x2019;Urville, Arapawa, Chatham, Pitt, Ulva, Ruapuke, Solander and many muttonbird islands near Stewart Island. All North Island populations apart from Kapiti Island are North Island weka, all South Island populations from Marlborough Sounds to Fiordland are western weka. Most Stewart Island and nearby island populations are Stewart Island weka, but some muttonbird islands may have had weka introduced from elsewhere. The buff weka is extinct in the eastern South Island (apart from some small scale reintroductions), but thrives as introduced populations on Chatham and Pitt Islands. The Kapiti Island population is apparently derived from a mix of (at least) North Island and western weka.</p>\n<p>Weka occur in a wide variety of habitats, from the coastline to above the tree-line, including wetlands, rough pasture, shrubland, and native and plantation forests. They are often encountered at the margin of two habitats (e.g. the forest/pasture edge), and are reliant on areas of dense cover to retreat to.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Weka populations often experience sudden declines after years of population expansion. These have been cyclic in Golden Bay. Healthy mainland and island populations have at least 0.6 weka per ha, with overall densities ranging between 0.06 and 2.6 weka per ha.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The main recognised threats are starvation during droughts, and predation by mustelids, especially ferrets. &#xA0;Weka are often killed by uncontrolled dogs, and are legally hunted on the Chatham Islands and on some muttonbird islands. Weka have been eradicated from many islands where they had been introduced to, due to their predatory impacts on other fauna, especially burrow-nesting seabirds, ground nesting birds, reptiles and large invertebrates.</p>\n<p>Since 1863, there have been about 100 attempts to establish new weka populations for conservation reasons using translocations; only 14 of these were successful, nearly all of which were on small islands. The only natural North Island population that exists is that between Motu and Opotiki, near East Cape. All South Island mainland populations (apart from Totaranui, Golden Bay) and remaining island populations in the Marlborough Sounds are natural, while all remaining populations on Stewart Island, on most of the islands surrounding Stewart Island, and on the Chatham Islands are introductions.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The timing and number of clutches per annum varies between some pairs producing multiple clutches per annum, to intermittent breeding once every few years. Annually breeding occurs from late winter to early summer. The nest is a woven cup of fine grass or sedge leaves in dense vegetation, usually under an object or within a burrow with very little head space. Clutch size is typically 1-2 (or 3) eggs on islands and 2-4 eggs on the mainland. The female does most incubation between early morning and late afternoon and the male does the rest, and most of the parental care.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Weka are flightless, and often approach people closely. When foraging, they move leaf litter with their bills but not their feet. Pairs roost together at night in the same location and duet from that site. The oldest known bird was 14 years old on the South Island mainland and 19 years old on Kapiti Island. Weka have been known to return overland after translocation, or swim over 1 km, as they did to Maud Island after they were removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Weka are omnivorous, and are both scavengers and predators. They consume a wide variety of fruit and invertebrates, also eggs, lizards, small mammals and birds, and carrion. They have been recorded killing animals as large and tough as stoats (300 g), Norway rats (500 g), and Westland petrels (1200 g).</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Beauchamp, A.J. 1987 Unpubl thesis.

Three specimens were originally documented by&#xA0;Captain Frederick&#xA0;Hutton but, out of these, only the juvenile can now be located. A total of only 34 skinned specimens survive in museums, but abundant fossils provide an additional rich source of information. Unfortunately very little was recorded about the behaviour of the species. The Chatham Island rail was one of six species of rail that occurred in pre-human times at the Chatham island group but&#xA0;all four endemic taxa are now extinct as a result of human caused changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The plumage of adult Chatham Island rails had a soft &apos;fluffy&apos; appearance due to loose fitting feathers which in the past led some ornithologists to conclude that adults were actually juvenile Dieffenbach&apos;s rails. Adults were largely brown in colour but their ventral feathers were pale-tipped, which gave their undersides a faintly barred appearance. Their tails were very short and their legs and beak were brown. Males were larger than females. The young were uniformly brownish.</p>\n<p>Voice: all that is known&#xA0;is that the mother of a young rail held by Henry Travers was attracted to the &quot;plaintive cry&quot; of its offspring.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Historically, the Chatham Island rail was reported only from 131 ha Mangere Island. However Holocene bone deposits show that the species was once widespread in the Chatham archipelago, with records from main Chatham, Pitt and Mangere Islands. In one cave beside Te Whanga Lagoon on main Chatham, bones of hundreds of individuals were found. Historic reports of the species from Pitt Island are based on misleading specimen labels.</p>\n<p>Few observations of live Chatham Island rails were recorded. This may be partly because the species was mainly active at night. Henry Travers reported that the species was found &quot;in a very rocky place, and when disturbed sought to hide themselves amongst the stones&quot;; the birds that he collected &quot;came out of the rocks at dusk, evidently to feed&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Fossils attest to the former abundance of the species in the Chatham Island archipelago. However on its last refuge of Mangere Island, Henry Travers reported seeing only three Chatham Island rails during 12 days ashore.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island rail was eliminated from most islands in the Chatham group by a range of human introduced predators - possibly including Pacific rats, Norway rats, dogs, pigs and cats. The last specimens were collected in 1893. By 1894, shortly after cats became established on Mangere Island, the Chatham Island rail was extinct.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Almost nothing was recorded about the breeding habits of the Chatham Island rail. A single report states that nests were &quot;in holes in the ground, and when the young hatched they [got] into fallen hollow trees&quot; (Forbes 1893). Like the young of other rails, this indicates that hatchlings were precocial. The sole egg that was collected (28 x 37 mm) was nearly white, with faint grey and rufous spots.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island rails were reported to feed on invertebrates, particularly hoppers (amphipods). The long bill is assumed to have been used for probing. When combined with its nocturnal habits, the species may have been superficially reminiscent of a miniature kiwi. It shared this niche with the Chatham Island snipe, which was also present on Mangere Island until the early 1890s.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Rail\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Rail</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Forbes, H.O. 1893.

They photographed the bones by candle light and carefully collected them so that they could be described and named. Excavations of a stratified fossil bed at Lake Poukawa, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay showed that although previously common, snipe-rails were drastically reduced in numbers during the last 1000 years of the records. This decline coincided with Maori occupation of New Zealand and the vegetation of the site changing from podocarp forest to bracken and scrub, which suggests fires were lit about that time. The key factor, however, was probably the introduction of the Polynesian rat or kiore which might have attacked the adults but certainly would have destroyed the eggs and chicks of these birds, which were extinct by the time of European settlement.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The snipe-rail was a small flightless rail with particularly tiny wings but well developed legs. It was estimated to have been about 240 g in weight, which makes it a bit larger than a banded rail. The snipe-rail was remarkable for its very long and slender curved bill (about 7 cm long), which was longer, in proportion to the size of the bird, than that of any other rail.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Bones of the snipe-rail have been found widely in the North Island but never in the South Island. They were most common under wetter western forests with a closed canopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Some inferences can be made about the life style of the snipe-rail from features of its bones. The remarkable bill was very different from the solid pecking bills of most other small rails, being long, slender and flexible. The upper part of the bill could be bent, both near the base and near the tip, using muscles in the head with the force transmitted using ligaments and bars of bone. This allowed the bird to open and close the tip of the bill under the soil, while the bill base remained closed. This facility is known from other species of birds such as godwits, snipe and kiwi that probe into the substrate for prey, and allows them to grasp food with considerably less effort than if they opened the entire bill. The bill tip is slightly flattened and pocked with pits for sensory cells, known as Herbst&#x2019;s corpuscles, which sense changes in pressure in moist soil and mud. This shows that snipe-rails were able to use a sense known as &#x201C;remote touch&#x201D; where a probing bird can&#xA0;detect the movements of prey without actually touching it because the waves of pressure in water that worms and grubs make as they move in the soil are felt. This improves the birds ability to locate and capture prey in the soil.</p>\n<p>Snipe-rails shared the forests with other species of probing birds that each had a different reach: North Island snipe could have reached to about 45 mm, snipe-rail to 56 mm, little spotted kiwi to 80 mm, and North Island brown kiwi to 130 mm.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipe-rail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipe-rail</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Horn, P.L. 1983.

It is the only member of the genus <em>Diaphorapteryx</em>. Hawkins&apos; rail is part of the vast radiation of rails that spread across Oceania, speciating into new taxa on many islands. Most of these rails were flightless species and were wiped out due to human colonisation. Although the only known specimens of Hawkins&apos; rail are fossil bones, there are brief written accounts suggesting that the species survived into the 19th century. The first specimen described was a skull brought to the Canterbury Museum in 1892 by William Hawkins, after whom the species was named.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>No detailed description of the plumage of Hawkins&apos; rail was ever recorded, and no feathered specimens are preserved, so little detail is known about its colours. However bones and brief accounts indicate that it was a large reddish-brown rail with a disproportionately long down-curved bill about 10 cm long. Males were considerably larger than females, with bills at least 2 cm longer. A single bill plate fragment is also coloured reddish-brown. Several complete skeletons exist and show that its wings were very small and that it was certainly flightless.</p>\n<p>Voice: two accounts state that it had a powerful strident call, like <em>Tue-ck</em>, that could be heard at great distances.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Hawkins&apos; rail is known to have occurred on the two largest islands in the Chatham group. Holocene fossil bones of the species have been found commonly on main Chatham Island and also on Pitt Island. One brief account suggests that Hawkins&apos; rail occurred in open areas known as &quot;The Clears&quot;. If its habits resembled those of the weka, it was likely to have been widespread in most terrestrial habitats.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is known about the former population size of the species, however, the abundance of its bones suggests that it was once relatively numerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Hawkins&apos; rail is known from Moriori food middens and is thought to have become extinct as a result of human hunting, possibly combined with predation from various introduced mammals. The level of detail recorded in late 19th century accounts suggest that the species may have persisted into the early European era, i.e. early 1800s. These accounts document two Moriori hunting methods of capturing roosting or nesting birds. As the birds apparently always walked with their heads down pecking, hunters could approach them quietly from the front and, before being noticed, simply grab the birds by the neck and strangle them; however, anyone approaching from behind or from the side was quickly detected and the birds would escape. The other hunting method involved observing roosting sites, making long tracks up to the sites, carefully removing any sticks or obstructions which might alarm the birds by cracking, then sneaking up quietly and &quot;making a stealthy rush&quot; to pounce on and kill the whole group.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Nests were never described, but nesting sites were apparently sometimes found among vegetation in relatively open areas known as &quot;The Clears&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Hawkins&apos; rail had robust legs and long toes to suit its ground-dwelling lifestyle. It is likely to have filled a similar ecological niche to weka on mainland New Zealand. Hawkins&apos; rails are reported to have sometimes slept together in roosting or family groups - &quot;six or eight&quot; huddled together &quot;like pigs in a bed&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>One account said that the species &quot;kept its head continually on the ground looking for food, chiefly fernroot, which it burrowed for and dug out with its powerful bill, making, it is said, a rooting like a pig&quot;. It was also reported to peck decaying wood on the ground. As its bill was longer and more curved than that of a weka, it may have been less predatory than that species, but ground-nesting birds, lizards and invertebrates are likely to have made up part of its diet.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkins&apos;s_Rail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkins&apos;s_Rail</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Cooper, J.H.; Tennyson, A.J.D. 2004.

It is possible that calls of unseen birds could be confused.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Spotless crakes are widely if patchily distributed throughout the North Island, but are rare in the South Island. They are present on Raoul Island and the adjacent Meyer Islets (Kermadec Islands), and Great Barrier, Three Kings, Poor Knights,&#xA0;Tiritiri Matangi and Motuora Islands. There are no confirmed records from the Chatham Islands since 1949.</p>\n<p>On the mainland the spotless crake is predominantly a bird of freshwater wetlands dominated by dense emergent vegetation, particularly raupo (<em>Typha orientalis</em>). They may forage on open mud near dense vegetation but are quick to retreat when disturbed. Spotless crakes live in dry forest on some islands, including the Kermadec Islands, Poor Knights,&#xA0;Tiritiri Matangi and Motuora.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>No population estimates available. Fewer than 50 adults were estimated to be present on Aorangi in 1980, where the smallest territory was 45 x 50 metres, or approximately 4 pairs per ha.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Habitat loss through destruction of the vast majority of lowland wetlands for agriculture is presumed to have had a significant impact on spotless crakes. It was previously given the conservation status of Relict (i.e. occupying less than 10% of its original range) due to more than 90% of New Zealand&#x2019;s wetlands having been converted to farmland and towns. Introduced predators are likely to prey on crakes. The presence of spotless crakes in dry forest on predator-free islands suggests they may have formerly used a wider range of habitats.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Spotless crakes are monogamous and territorial. When nesting in wetlands, the nest of woven grass and sedge leaves is raised 30&#x2013;50 cm above water level, often in a clump of C<em>arex </em>sedge. Several nest-like platforms are often built near the actual nest. The clutch of 2&#x2013;5 cream coloured eggs is laid from late August to January and incubated by both parents for 20&#x2013;22 days. The chicks remain in the nest for up to 4 days and are cared for by both parents for 4&#x2013;5 months. Chicks are capable of catching live prey from 3 days old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Very secretive and largely crepuscular. Spotless crakes seldom venture far from the cover of vegetation during daylight. Pairs and some single birds defend territories. Parents may feign injury to distract predators.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Spotless crakes have a broad omnivorous diet, feeding on seeds, fruit and leaves of aquatic plants, and a wide variety of invertebrates including worms, snails, spiders, beetles and other insects.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.; Robertson H. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New New Zealand</em>.

In non-breeding plumage the back and crown are pale grey, as are the upper wings, which also possess a prominent white wing bar and dark grey/black leading and trailing edges. Juvenile plumage is similar but shows spangling on the back. In breeding plumage the head, throat, upper breast, upper forewings and upper back are rufous and look scaled and streaked. The rufous on the breast is strongly demarcated from the white lower breast and belly. In all plumages the underwing is white. Females are slightly larger than males. Siberian birds show greater sexual dimorphism than those from Canada and Greenland. Sanderlings run rapidly with legs moving so fast that they can seem like wheels, and feed busily. They repeatedly dash up beaches in front of advancing waves and then race after the receding water to feed in the wet sand. Sanderlings feed in sand and mud with rapid pecking or probing.</p>\n<p>Voice: a high-pitched <em>kwit</em> and occasional trilling.</p>\n<p>Similar species: dunlin is slightly smaller and has a thinner curved bill. Sanderling has a shorter darker bill, more white in the wings and lacks a hind toe. Common sandpiper and shore plover are small waders with a similarly prominent white wingbar apparent in flight, but have very different markings if the bird is seen well after landing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Sanderlings breed in the Arctic and migrate (from mid-July to mid-August) to the coasts of western and southern Europe, Africa, North and South America, southern Asia and Australia (arriving in September and departing in March). They typically spend the non-breeding season on sandy beaches and estuaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>World population 620,000 to 700,000 birds. About 10,000 migrate to Australia, some overwinter. A regular vagrant to New Zealand, with one or two birds reported most years, from Northland to Southland, and twice to Chatham Island (including 3 birds in December 1985). Sites where sanderlings regularly occur include Parengarenga Harbour, Kaipara Harbour (Tapora and Papakanui spit), Maketu, Farewell Spit, Lake Ellesmere,&#xA0;and Waituna Lagoon, Southland. Most sightings are of single birds, but flocks of 4-6 birds have been recorded at most of the above sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Sanderlings breed mostly within the Arctic Circle. They can be either monogamous or polyandrous; often two clutches (or three or more in cases of polyandry) of 4 eggs, one incubated by the female, the other by the male, laid in a depression in bare earth from mid-June. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Sanderlings are gregarious and often found with other waders in coastal areas, particularly on sandy beaches, but also tidal mudflats.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Sanderlings eat mainly small crustaceans, polychaete worms, insects and molluscs, but also arthrpod eggs, small fish and carrion.

In particular it is similar to the slightly larger curlew sandpiper, but with shorter legs and bill. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The dunlin is a very rare vagrant to New Zealand, with four accepted records.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The dunlin is a small short-legged wader with a relatively long slightly down-curved bill. The size and bill length can vary significantly between subspecies and individuals. Females have longer bills than males. Of subspecies likely to be encountered in New Zealand the American <em>pacifica</em> is the largest and has the longest bill, <em>sakhalina</em>, which breeds in Siberia and Alaska, <em>actites</em>, which breeds on northern Sakhalin, <em>kistchinskii</em>, which breeds in far eastern Russia, and a<em>rticola</em>, which breeds in north west Alaska, are intermediate in size and bill length between <em>pacifica </em>&#xA0;and the European subspecies. In breeding plumage the black belly is very distinctive. The crown and upper back are ruddy, with the latter scaled, the breast is streaked pale grey, the lower back and upper wings are grey and the tip of the tail is black. There is a prominent broad white supercilium. The folded wings do not reach past the tail. In non-breeding plumage dunlin have a scaly pale grey-brown back and crown, white belly and face, and a white breast with faint grey streaking. In flight dunlin display white patches on either side of the otherwise dark upper tail, and a prominent white wingbar. Their typical feeding behaviour involves vigorous probing interspersed with rapid running.</p>\n<p>Voice: a buzzy <em>tree</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the bane of twitchers; dunlin can be, and has been, confused with almost every other small wader, from least sandpiper to curlew sandpiper. The black belly in breeding plumage is diagnostic. In non-breeding plumage the longer bill is sufficient to distinguish dunlin from stints.&#xA0; The significantly shorter legs should be sufficient to distinguish dunlin from curlew sandpiper (Individuals of the subspecies <em>pacifica</em> are almost the same size as, and have a bill of similar length to, curlew sandpiper.) Dunlin also appears horizontal when feeding and roosting; in contrast to the more upright curlew sandpiper. The similar-sized white-rumped and Baird&#x2019;s sandpipers have wings that extend beyond the tail. The former, with which dunlin has been known to interbreed, has a white rump. In non-breeding plumage dunlin is darker than sanderling, with less white in the wings, and has a longer bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The dunlin breeds in northern Russia, Europe, Greenland, Canada and Alaska, and migrates to the coasts of southern North America, south and west Europe, north and west Africa, the Middle East, China and Japan.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The dunlin is one of the world&#x2019;s most abundant waders, with an estimated population between 4,600,000 and 6,500,000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are four accepted records of dunlin from New Zealand: Kaipara Harbour (February 1974), Manukau Harbour (June 1979, April-June 2006), and Miranda (March 1977). An earlier record from the Manukau Harbour (November 1969) is highly probable, and at least one additional record was never submitted for verification. All these birds had at least some dark feathers on their belly, greatly facilitating their identification. There are two confirmed records in Australia (both in Queensland).</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Dunlin breed as monogamous pairs in coastal grassland, saltmarsh, upland moorland and Arctic tundra. The clutch of 4 eggs is laid in a scrape; incubation and chick-rearing are shared, and the young leave the nest soon after hatching. Dunlin have been recorded to have interbred with white-rumped sandpiper, sanderling and purple sandpiper (<em>C. maritima</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Outside the breeding season, dunlin are typically found in the company of other waders, on muddy estuaries and coastlines.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Dunlin mainly eat small invertebrates (worms, crustaceans, molluscs and insects) obtained by probing.

It is a regular summer visitor to New Zealand, but in declining numbers. The global population is thought to be increasing but the East Asian-Australasian Flyway population is in decline. Probably&#xA0;fewer than 40 birds&#xA0;now reach New Zealand each summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The curlew sandpiper is an elegant, slender sandpiper; its relatively long thin legs (always black), long thin decurved bill and white rump distinguish it from all other small sandpipers. In breeding plumage the curlew sandpiper is dark red with fine white fringes to the body feathers, and the back is grey to black with red spots, contrasting with the white rump. The non-breeding plumage is very plain, with light grey-brown upperparts with fine white fringes to feathers, and mostly white underparts and bold white rump.</p>\n<p>Voice: a soft &#x2018;chirrup&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>\n<p>Similar species: western and broad-billed sandpipers have slightly decurved bills but are smaller with much shorter legs. Dunlin also has a slightly decurved bill but the bill is not as long and fine as curlew sandpiper and its legs are shorter. Dunlin breeding plumage is very different, with a black belly, but winter plumages are similar. The legs of the stilt sandpiper are greenish, never black.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Curlew sandpipers breed in the high Arctic from central to eastern Siberia, and formally around Barrow in Alaska. Their non-breeding grounds are in sub-Saharan Africa (right across the continent, along rivers and lakes and as far south as South Africa) and also Australasia, at coastal and inland sites. In New Zealand curlew sandpipers are rarely seen away from mudflats or shallow coastal pools. Curlew sandpiper can be found in major harbours and estuaries from Parengarenga, Far North to Awarua Bay, Southland, although its strongholds are now Manukau Harbour and Lake Ellesmere. Vagrant birds have also reached Chatham Island (January 1977) and Enderby Island, Auckland Islands (1972-73).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The global population of curlew sandpipers is estimated at 1.8 - 1.9 million and thought to be increasing. However, the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) population was estimated at 180,000 in 1993 and is probably in decline. Numbers in New South Wales dropped from several thousand in the 1980s to less than 400 by 2010.&#xA0; Less than 40 have reached New Zealand each summer since 2000, with rarely more than 2-3 overwintering.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Most waders migrating along the EAAF, particularly those using coastal and inland wetlands in China and Korea, are under serious threat from habitat loss, due mostly to reclamation and human based development and disturbance in the region. Breeding grounds and most wintering sites are probably secure, although inland wetlands used by curlew sandpiper in southern Australia have decreased in recent years, due to low rainfall and increased water usage for irrigation. The Bohai Bay in China is known be an important northward staging site; this region is experiencing massive industrial development, and so the population is likely to be further impacted in the coming years. </p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Curlew sandpipers breed in high Arctic tundra. Females incubate the clutch of 4 eggs alone, the males having left the breeding grounds soon after egg laying. Young are protected by the female until fledged. As with most sandpipers, chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and feed themselves on insects and other small invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The curlew sandpiper is a very long distance migrant, although much of the migration and staging strategy is not fully understood. They reach New Zealand in September and October and are one of the last waders to leave in April and even the first week of May. Twenty-one have been banded in New Zealand on the Manukau Harbour, Firth of Thames and Manawatu Estuary. There have been regular resightings of these at the banding sites over several years, indicating some site faithfulness. A bird banded in its first year on the Manukau Harbour in April 1992 was retrapped 11 years later in Victoria, in January 2003.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Polychaete worms, molluscs, crustaceans (such as amphipods, brine shrimps and small crabs).

It has typical sandpiper morphology and structure (e.g., long bill, long legs, and pointed wings), and both its juvenile and adult plumages are similar to the other <em>Calidris</em> sandpipers. Even behaviourally it is a conventional sandpiper - it is a gregarious, long distant migrant. On the Arctic breeding grounds male stilt sandpipers conduct acrobatic aerial territorial displays, a behaviour observed in many other sandpipers (e.g., dunlin, and least, semipalmated and western sandpipers). However, recent genetic evidence suggests that the stilt sandpiper does not belong to the genus <em>Calidris</em>, but rather it is a close relative.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The stilt sandpiper is a medium-sized wader. In non-breeding plumage, it has brown-grey upperparts (head, neck, mantle, wings), grey sides that smudge into a whitish belly, a white rump and grey tail. It also has a distinctive whitish supercilium (eyebrow) and no wing bars. The dark-coloured bill is long relative to its body size and it has a slight downward curve. The long legs can be various shades of green, juveniles have legs that tend to be yellowy-green.</p>\n<p>Voice: when flushed the stilt sandpiper gives a repeated <em>chyurt </em>call.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the downward curvature of the bill could lead to confusion with curlew sandpipers and some subspecies of dunlin (e.g., <em>C. alpina pacifica</em>), but the stilt sandpiper has long, greenish legs, while both the curlew sandpiper and dunlin have black legs. Under poor lighting, the yellowy-green legs of a juvenile stilt sandpiper might lead one to think of dowitchers (<em>Limnodromus scolopaceus </em>or <em>L. griseus</em>) or yellowlegs (<em>Tringa flavipes</em> or<em> T. melanoleuca</em>) but neither group has a downward-curved bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Stilt sandpipers breed in the coastal regions of western Northwest and Yukon Territories (Canada) and Northern Alaska (USA).

Almost all are long-distance migrants, and so are capable of crossing the vast expanses of ocean required to get to New Zealand. Four members of the genus visit New Zealand often enough to be considered regular migrants, but another 12 species have been identified in New Zealand on at least one occasion. The sharp-tailed sandpiper is one of the regulars, along with lesser knot, red-necked stint and curlew sandpiper. Until the 1990s, up to 200 sharp-tailed sandpipers visited New Zealand each summer, and could be found in flocks of 5-10 birds at favoured estuaries and wetlands scattered throughout the country. Their numbers have since plummeted, and perhaps as few as 30 birds are now reaching New Zealand each year. Because New Zealand is on the edge of the sharp-tailed sandpiper range, it is unclear whether the large decline in the number of birds arriving here mirrors overall population trends, or whether it reflects a change in migration patterns, with a lower proportion of birds crossing the Tasman Sea.</p>\n<p>Both the common name and the scientific name (<em>acuminata</em>) refer to the individually sharply-pointed tail feathers, a feature only apparent if the bird is in the hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The sharp-tailed sandpiper is a smallish, speckled brown and white wader with straight, shortish&#xA0;dark bill and reddish cap to its head. It is midway in size between a lesser knot and a red-necked stint, being similar in size to a banded dotterel, but slimmer and more elegant. A prominent white eyebrow extends well back above the eye, and a narrow white eye-ring is apparent in good views. The feathers on the back and wings are rich brown or chestnut with pale borders, though can be much greyer than this. Brownish speckles on the breast feathers merge into the pale belly in a diffuse border (cf. a sharp border in the similar pectoral sandpiper). Breeding plumage is similar, but with prominent dark chevrons on the otherwise pale flanks. The bill is dark, grading into pale brown at the base of the lower mandible; the legs are yellowish. Males are 15% larger than females. Juveniles are more brightly coloured, with the rufous cap, lores and ear coverts strongly contrasting with the white eyebrow, an orange-buff wash to the breast, and with back feathers fringed with bright chestnut, white and buff. The steady gait of sharp-tailed sandpipers, pecking and probing, is quite different to the run-stop-peck action of small plovers such as banded dotterel.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice: a soft <em>trreep</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the pectoral sandpiper (which often associates with sharp-tailed sandpipers), has a sharp boundary between the dark speckling on the breast and white lower breast and belly. The pectoral sandpiper generally lacks the rufous cap of the sharp-tailed sandpiper, and has a more two-tone bill, yellowish at the base.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Sharp-tailed sandpipers breed in northern Siberia, from the delta of the Lena River east to east of the Kolyma River delta. Over 90% of the population migrates to Australasia in the non-breeding season, with the remainder mainly in Melanesia and Polynesia. The mudflats of the Yellow Sea (China and South Korea) are important staging areas during migration.</p>\n<p>Sharp-tailed sandpiper can occur in suitable coastal habitat anywhere around the main islands of New Zealand, regularly on Chatham Island, and occasionally on Raoul Island, Kermadec Islands (4 records), Snares Islands (3 records), and Enderby Island, Auckland Islands (1972-73).</p>\n<p>Sharp-tailed sandpipers occur in New Zealand between September and April, with a very few staying over winter. They are found mainly at the coast in tidal harbours and the shallow margins of lowland lakes, in areas of short, sparse vegetation. They have also been seen inland in braided rivers in Canterbury. Sharp-tailed sandpipers are often seen in areas frequented by wrybills and banded dotterel, but they generally associate with others of their kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>About 160,000 sharp-tailed sandpipers are estimated to occur in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, with c.91% migrating to Australia in the non-breeding season. The number visiting New Zealand each year was about 100-200 birds up until the 1990s, but has since declined markedly. Between 1985 and 1989 an average of 18 was seen at Lake Ellesmere each year; this dropped to an average of only 12 between 2006 and 2009. During this latter time period, fewer than 25 sharp-tailed sandpipers&#xA0;were recorded from the whole country each year.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The number of sharp-tailed sandpipers reaching New Zealand is likely to be adversely affected by reclamation and pollution of essential staging habitat in the Yellow Sea (between China and the Korean Peninsula), required by the birds on migration in both directions.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Sharp-tailed sandpipers breed in coastal tundra of northern Siberia. They are polygynous, with males performing elaborate aerial courtship displays and mating with multiple females, which care for the eggs and chicks alone. The clutch of 4 eggs is laid in a well-hidden ground nest, with chicks leaving the nest soon after they hatch.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In autumn [April] sharp-tailed sandpipers begin to attain breeding plumage in New Zealand and become more animated and courtship behaviour can be observed before migration.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Sharp-tailed sandpipers are omnivorous, consuming seeds and invertebrates including worms, molluscs, shrimps and insects.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp-tailed_Sandpiper\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp-tailed_Sandpiper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3053\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3053</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/sharp-tailed-sandpiper/calidris-acuminata/\">http://www.arkive.org/sharp-tailed-sandpiper/calidris-acuminata/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=874\">http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=874</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Chandler, R. 2009. <em>Shorebirds of North America, Europe and Asia</em>.

Males are much larger than females, and have an inflatable throat sac which expands and contracts during display flights, while they produce an unusual hooting sound. They are promiscuous and polygynous, with the male taking no part in incubation or check-rearing. The nest is a shallow depression lined with fragments of vegetation; the clutch of 4 eggs hatch after 21-23 days of incubation. Chicks leave the nest and feed themselves within hours of hatching, and are attended by the female for at least 10 days.

It is a small, rather plain wader, even in breeding plumage, and closely resembles white-rumped sandpiper, with which it forms a &#x2018;species pair&#x2019;.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Baird&#x2019;s sandpiper is a small wader, larger than a stint but smaller than a sharp-tailed sandpiper. It is rather plain in all plumages. In non-breeding plumage, it is grey or brownish-grey above, the mantle and scapular feathers showing dark central streaks along the feather vane, and pale fringes, giving a slightly scaly appearance. The underparts are white, with variable amounts of streaking from the throat to the upper breast, but not extending along the flanks. The supercilium is rather indistinct. The bill is straight or slightly down-curved, it and the legs are black. In flight, the upper tail has a dark central stripe and very small white patches at the sides. There is a weak white wingbar. In breeding plumage, there are a variable number of mantle feathers with dark-brown to blackish centres fringed with buff, reportedly fading to dull black as the season progresses. Juvenile birds, like most small sandpipers, show a far stronger pattern to the upperparts than non-breeding adults, and a richer, buff-washed pattern of streaking on the breast, ending abruptly almost in the manner of a pectoral sandpiper.</p>\n<p>Voice: calls away from breeding locations are typically short, and relatively low-pitched in comparison with the high <em>zeet</em> typical of the similar white-rumped sandpiper.</p>\n<p>Similar species: red-necked stint is smaller, with a proportionately shorter bill. The white-rumped sandpiper is very similar, differing only in having streaking on the flanks, and the diagnostic white rump visible in flight. Pectoral sandpiper is larger with yellowish legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Baird&#x2019;s sandpiper breeds across Arctic Canada and Alaska, extending to north-western Greenland and eastern Siberia. It is a long-distance migrant to western and southern South America, with birds regularly reaching the Falkland Islands, and recorded on the Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia. &#xA0;Baird&#x2019;s sandpiper also occurs as a vagrant in Europe and Australia. There are seven accepted New Zealand records.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population of Baird&#x2019;s sandpiper is about 300,000 individuals and apparently stable.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The seven accepted New Zealand records were mainly during the 1970s: Manukau Harbour (March 1970, April 1976), Firth of Thames (December 1970, November-December 1971, October 1972), Manawatu Estuary (October 1976), Portland Island (November 2002).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Baird&#x2019;s sandpipers migrate mainly through central North America and are found rather less frequently along the coast. They favour inland waters as a rule, and show a marked preference for drier locations; they are often recorded in habitats such as short grassland. Baird&#x2019;s sandpipers are noted for occasionally being found at high elevation on migration, where they have been found feeding on snowbanks. While this pattern is repeated in their non-breeding grounds, birds may also typically be found in small flocks on rocky or sandy coasts, often with white-rumped sandpipers and other species. All New Zealand records are from estuarine or coastal areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Baird&#x2019;s sandpipers breed from eastern Siberia, across North America to north-western Greenland. The birds select lowland to upland tundra in the high Arctic, mainly in drier areas with sparse vegetation. Both members of a pair share incubation, though typically the female will desert while the chicks are still very small.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Baird&#x2019;s sandpipers feed mainly on insects, with other small invertebrates also taken, especially in estuarine habitats.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdwatch.co.uk/categories/articleitem.asp?item=430\">http://www.birdwatch.co.uk/categories/articleitem.asp?item=430</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3051\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3051</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.surfbirds.com/Features/coxpeeps1006/coxpeeps1006pt3.html\">http://www.surfbirds.com/Features/coxpeeps1006/coxpeeps1006pt3.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=854\">http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=854</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Hayman, P.; Marchant, J.; Prater, T. 1986. <em>Shorebirds: an identification guide to the waders of the world</em>.

Migration routes tend to follow inland paths northbound, and they are rare west of the Rockies. The southbound migration more closely follows the Atlantic coast. Non-breeding grounds are in southern South America, from Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil to Tierra del Fuego, and from sea level to 4,000 m in the Chilean Andes. Flocks are regular in the Falkland Islands, and vagrants have occurred in South Georgia, Europe, and other locations as far afield as South Africa. White-rumped sandpipers have been identified over 20 times in Australia. There are two accepted New Zealand records.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The North American (including Canadian) population of white-rumped sandpipers is estimated at 300,000 birds. There are two accepted New Zealand records.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Only two accepted records for New Zealand: two birds at Manukau Harbour in December 1969; one at Parengarenga Harbour in March 1971.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>White-rumped sandpipers migrate rather later than other species through the Americas, favouring inland sites, to the east of the Rocky Mountains, when moving north, and sometimes persisting into late autumn before moving to their non-breeding grounds again. Southbound migration through North America is typically further east. While favouring freshwater habitats, non-breeding (and some migrant) birds may often be found on the coast. The two New Zealand records were in estuarine habitats. White-rumped sandpipers breed on damp, mainly near-coastal tundra. The high-pitched short squeaky call &#x2018;zeet&#x2019; likely to be given on take-off is distinctive.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>White-rumped sandpipers are ranked Least concern by IUCN, as the birds are numerous (300,000+ individuals) and cover a wide geographical range. Monitoring at two breeding sites showed no change in density over a 20-year period..</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>White-rumped sandpipers breed as monogamous pairs in wet, mostly coastal tundra. Incubation of the 4-egg clutch is shared and takes 20-22 days. The chicks leave the nest and feed themselves soon after hatching. Most brood care is by the male; chicks can fly from 18 days old.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>White-rumped sandpipers consume small invertebrates obtained by rapid pecking action on muddy surfaces, or sometimes in short grassland</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=057073\">http://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=057073</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3050\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3050</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://aba.org/birding/v40n4p40w1.pdf\">http://aba.org/birding/v40n4p40w1.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sdakotabirds.com/species/white_rumped_sandpiper_info.htm\">http://sdakotabirds.com/species/white_rumped_sandpiper_info.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Edgar, A.T, 1971.

Each bird was associated with a flock of red-necked stints, which enabled comparisons with that species to be made. This was essential for the records to be accepted, as the two species are very similar, and are regarded as one of the most difficult small sandpiper species pairs to separate.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The little stint is a tiny wader, and is very similar to the red-necked stint. The following pointers may assist identification (see references for authorities on shorebird identification). Little stints are fractionally smaller and slimmer than red-necked stints, with a slightly longer and finer bill. They are most easily separated in breeding plumage later in the southern summer. Little stints retain rufous in non-breeding plumage, which red-necked stint does not (at least in Australasia), and in comparison with red-necked are noticeably brighter in tone (but note that juvenile red-necked stints may be brighter or more &#x2018;contrasty&#x2019; than adults). Consistent features include a prominent mantle &#x2018;V&#x2019; shape, which is pale straw-coloured to yellow, an overall orange-rufous coloration of the upperparts which contrasts with the brick-red of red-necked stint, and a cream to white throat in all plumages, as opposed to brick-red in breeding plumage of red-necked. Little stints often show a &#x2018;split&#x2019; supercilium.</p>\n<p>Similar species: red-necked stint, western sandpiper, semipalmated sandpiper and Baird&#x2019;s sandpiper, are all small sandpipers with dark rumps and black legs. The differences between these species are subtle, and require careful checking of identification features, and (ideally) comparison between species (most vagrant small sandpipers in New Zealand associate with red-necked stints). Distinguishing characters include overall size (Baird&#x2019;s sandpiper is largest, little stint smallest), bill size and shape (western sandpiper has the longest bill, drooping at the tip; semipalmated sandpiper&#x2019;s bill is the thickest at the tip), the distribution and tone of any rufous plumage, and the presence of any dark streaking on the underparts.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The little stint is a widespread breeder in the Eurasian Arctic (overlapping in part with red-necked stint), and migrates to non-breeding grounds in the Indian subcontinent, Middle East and much of Africa. It is a regular vagrant to Australia. The only accepted New Zealand records to date have been from Lake Ellesmere, though careful observation is quite likely to reveal the species as occurring infrequently at other locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The little stint is an abundant species globally, with an estimated population of 1.4 to 1.5 million birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are three accepted records of little stint in New Zealand, all from Lake Ellesmere: November 1992 - April 1993, January-April 1995, and March 2010. There are unconfirmed reports of birds from other (North Island) locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>All records of little stint in New Zealand have been at Lake Ellesmere. The lake holds the largest New Zealand population of red-necked stints, with which the little stints were closely associated. The habitat is extensive salt marsh and mudflats, which are covered and uncovered as lake levels vary. Elsewhere the birds may be associated with either freshwater habitats or estuarine mudflats. The birds&#x2019; feeding and other behaviours were much as for red-necked stints, and particularly when roosting (often with wrybills or banded dotterels) they may be quite confiding. Calls are very similar to red-necked stint, and may be indistinguishable.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The little stint is ranked as Least Concern by IUCN, but is locally threatened by habitat degradation (mainly wetland and saltmarsh reclamation), illegal hunting, climate perturbation affecting salt regimes in saline wetlands, and outbreaks of avian malaria and avian botulism.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Little stints breed across a broad range in the high Arctic from northern Scandinavia east to the Lena River delta in Siberia. They prefer drier tundra at mainly low elevations, and are reported to be serially polygamous, with males and females incubating separate clutches of 3-4 eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Little stints consume small invertebrates obtained by rapid pecking action on muddy surfaces</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Stint\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Stint</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oceanwanderers.com/LtStint.html\">http://www.oceanwanderers.com/LtStint.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob5010.htm\">http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob5010.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3045\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3045</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Crocker , T.C.; Harrison, K.; O&#x2019;Donnell, C.F.J.; Petch, S. 2002.

The red-necked stint is the only stint species to regularly occur in New Zealand, with up to 200 spending the southern summer here each year. They are most often seen at high-tide roosts associating with other small waders, especially wrybills, and other sandpipers.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>A tiny, delicate, nondescript wader with dark legs and a short, straight black bill. Red-necked stints in breeding plumage have a distinctive rufous &#x2018;balaclava&#x2019;, but otherwise they are pale grey-brown above and off-white below throughout the year. Dorsal feathers with dark shafts and pale fringes; flight feathers dark, with slight white wing bar. Rump white with dark centre. Feeds with rapid stabbing action.</p>\n<p>Voice: thin, high-pitched chit.</p>\n<p>Similar species: much smaller than most other wader species. Two other stint species occur as very rare vagrants. Least sandpiper has yellow legs; little stint is very similar to red-necked stint but is slightly smaller with a slightly longer bill that is down-curved at the tip; breeding plumage of little stint is more orange, with white throat and chin.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Breeds in north-eastern Siberia and (more rarely) in north-west Alaska; migrates to south-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Found at scattered, mainly coastal sites throughout New Zealand, regularly occurring (in order of decreasing abundance) at Lake Ellesmere, Awarua Bay, Manukau Harbour, Farewell Spit, Porangahau Estuary, Parengarenga Harbour, Kaipara, Lake Grassmere, Firth of Thames. Vagrant to Chatham and Auckland Is. Mainly found on estuaries with extensive mudflats, also shallow brackish coastal lakes with saltmarsh margins. Often roosts on shellbanks and sandspits, among other waders.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>World population about 325,000 birds, with about 270,000 reaching Australia annually, and 50-200 reaching New Zealand. Fewer than 50 stay in New Zealand in the southern winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Like most waders using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, red-necked stints are threatened by coastal pollution and reclamation and hunting along their migration route. However, red-necked stints largely avoid the shores of the Yellow Sea where the worst impacts occur (see lesser knot and bar-tailed godwit). The most important New Zealand sites are well protected.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Breeds in low tundra in the high Arctic. Monogamous; clutch of 4 eggs laid in a grass-lined depression on the ground. Incubation and chick-rearing shared. Young leave the nest soon after hatching.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology </strong></p>\n<p>Long-distance migrant, although details poorly known, mainly due to the bird&#x2019;s small body-size limiting its ability to carry tracking gadgets. The distances travelled (apparently thousands of kilometres non-stop) are astounding given the bird&#x2019;s tiny size and limited ability to store fat. Most arrive in New Zealand Sep-Nov, and depart in Mar-Apr. Two birds marked in Victoria, Australia were sighted at Lake Ellesmere. Red-necked stints associating with other waders are often obvious from their activity, continuing to feed while their larger companions roost. Stints feed together in loose flocks, probing rapidly with sewing-machine action.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Mainly small invertebrates obtained by probing and gleaning. Predominant foods include small gastropods, crustaceans (amphipods, ostracods), fly larvae and pupae; also seeds.

Snipe were well known to the muttonbirders as their alter-ego, the hakawai &#x2013; an unseen and terrifying call from the night sky. Considered by many to be given by an invisible spirit bird, the hakawai display is given by all living forms of <em>Coenocorypha</em> snipe. The display includes a roar created by vibration of the tail feathers as the bird dives at speed through the night sky, homologous with the drumming displays of <em>Gallinago</em> snipe.</p>\n<p>The South Island snipe was one of six species in the genus <em>Coenocorypha</em> from New Zealand, of which three became extinct following human contact. Outside New Zealand, <em>Coenocorypha</em> snipe also occurred in Fiji, on Norfolk Island, and in New Caledonia. These three forms are also extinct, and are known from a few subfossil bones.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Small, richly patterned snipe with 4 cm-long bill and short legs, wings and tail. Upperparts mottled chestnut and black with buff fringes. A band of dark mottling across the chest graded into an off-white belly. Leg colour yellow on Jacky Lee Island, pale yellow or grey on Taukihepa.</p>\n<p>Voice: few details known. A low hoarse double croak given by birds of a pair when separated (probably by the male, based on Snares Island snipe behaviour); a hand-held chick gave a &#x201C;dolorous wailing&#x201D; (Guthrie-Smith). The hakawai aerial display was a series of disyllabic calls followed by a non-vocal roar made by the vibrating tail feathers.</p>\n<p>Similar species: South Island snipe differed from Snares Island snipe in having bold chestnut markings on their backs, a gorget of blackish crescents across their chests, and unmarked bellies (finely barred in Snares Island snipe). The only other small ground bird present on muttonbird islands (previously including both Jacky Lee Island and Taukihepa) was the banded rail (mioweka).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Subfossil bone deposits reveal that the South Island snipe occurred throughout the South Island and on Stewart Island and some offshore islands (Native and Ruapuke Islands). Specimens and well-documented sightings by naturalists were known from only Jacky Lee Island and Taukihepa (both off Stewart Island). Muttonbirders reported snipe also from Pukeweka, Solomon, Mokoiti and Herekopare Islands, and hakawai also from Mokinui, Kundy, Green and Breaksea (Rukawahakura &amp; Wharepuiataha) Islands. Recorded from dense <em>Muehlenbeckia</em> and supplejack vines and tree nettle under tree daisy forest on Jacky Lee Island. Throughout vegetated areas on Taukihepa, including coastal tree daisy forest and inland rata forest. Following the introduction of weka to Taukihepa, snipe became confined to open &#x2018;pakihi&#x2019; vegetation of low <em>Dracophyllum longifolium</em> (grass tree) and manuka scrub over <em>Cladia</em> lichen fields on the tops of the island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>Never numerous. John McLean &amp; Guthrie-Smith saw only a single bird on one of three brief visits to 30 ha Jacky Lee Island during September-November 1911. Herbert Guthrie-Smith found three nests and knew of five pairs on Taukihepa in November 1923. Edgar Stead and companions found five nests and encountered six birds away from nests during 8 days of searching in November &#x2013;December 1931. Brian Bell and Don Merton saw a single bird during a month on Taukihepa in April 1961. No population estimates were made.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>South Island snipe became extinct in or soon after 1964 following the ship rat invasion of Taukihepa. Apart from a possible record from Dusky Sound, Fiordland, in 1773, the only sites where naturalists saw the South Island snipe were Jacky Lee Island between 1897 &amp; 1911, and Taukihepa between 1913 &amp; 1964. Snipe on Jacky Lee Island (the type locality) became extinct following the introduction of weka by muttonbirders between 1911 &amp; 1928. Snipe on the South Island and Stewart Island were probably extirpated by Pacific rats (kiore) introduced by Maori. The Wildlife Service attempted to catch snipe for translocation to a safe site in August 1964, but the two male birds captured both died in captivity before they could be moved.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding </strong></p>\n<p>Eight nests found under low <em>Dracophyllum</em> and <em>manuka</em> on Taukihepa in 1923 &amp; 1931 all contained two large eggs. Incubation was shared by the male and female, and chicks left the nest as soon as they were dry. Guthrie-Smith recorded two adults together caring for a single chick, while Stead recorded a chick with a single adult (the latter is typical of all other <em>Coenocorypha</em> snipe). Both incubation length and the period to chick independence are unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Both McLean and Guthrie-Smith noted that South Island snipe showed little concern at human proximity: &#x201C;the bird shewed no concern at my presence except that it kept amid the patch of ferns &amp; creeper &amp; I never got closer than 12 &#x2013; 15 feet &amp; even then it was often hidden. Its manner of running a few feet &amp; then stopping to probe amid the fallen leaves was very noticeable &amp; it was too intent upon this work to take any more heed of us than to keep just out of our way&#x201D; (McLean in Miskelly 2012). Hakawai aerial displays were given mainly on clear moonlit nights, probably to minimise the risk of snipe colliding with flying petrels (which are both more visible and less likely to come ashore on moonlit nights).</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Soil-dwelling invertebrates obtained by probing. Prey items identified by Guthrie-Smith&#xA0;included small worms and &#x201C;chrysalis-like objects&#x201D; (probably crane-fly pupae).</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Snipe\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Snipe</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Guthrie-Smith, H. 1936. <em>Sorrows and joys of a New Zealand naturalist</em>.

It was described in 1893 based on skulls from Chatham Island that had markedly longer bills than those of the living Chatham Island snipe <em>Coenocorypha pusilla</em>. The apparent co-existence of two species of snipe on the Chatham Islands is remarkable, as no other land mass in the region (including the much larger South and North Islands) had more than a single species of snipe. Forbes&#x2019; snipe is known from cranial bones (skulls and mandibles) from Chatham and Pitt Islands. There are currently no known methods or definitions to separate post-cranial bones of <em>C. chathamica</em> and <em>C. pusilla</em>. The large number of snipe limb and thoracic bones from the Chatham Islands (including a coracoid from Mangere Island) are best lumped together as &#x2018;<em>Coenocorypha</em> sp.&#x2019; Recent genetic comparisons of the living forms of <em>Coenocorypha</em> snipes indicate that the Chatham Island snipe (the smallest species) separated from the Snares Island snipe (<em>C. huegeli</em>) about 42,000 years ago, and that both these species separated from the subantarctic snipe (<em>C. aucklandica</em>) about 96,000 years ago. The bill length of Forbes&#x2019; snipe is very similar to that of the subantarctic snipe, and so it is possible that Forbes&#x2019; snipe were descended from the original snipe to colonise the Chatham Islands (perhaps concurrent with snipe reaching the Auckland Islands), and that the more recently colonising form (<em>pusilla</em>) evolved a smaller body size and bill length to reduce competition with the resident species. An alternative theory is that a single snipe species only was present on the Chatham Islands, but that it was formerly much more variable in size, with only the smallest individuals represented in the tiny population that persisted on Rangatira Island. This intriguing possibility may explain sightings of &#x2018;giant&#x2019; snipe by conservation workers on Rangatira Island in 1999-2001. Unfortunately the bird (or birds) was not photographed or caught for measuring and genetic sampling.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Henry Forbes&#x2019; description of &#x2018;<em>Gallinago chathamica</em>&#x2019; was exceedingly brief: &#x201C;A very much larger species than <em>G. pusilla</em>. The bill is 3 inches in length&#x201D;. Percy Lowe quantified this, describing the length of the bill (defined as from the tip of the premaxillae to a line joining the proximal ends of the outer processes of the nasals) as 63-77 mm (n = 8), compared to 54 mm for <em>C. pusilla</em>. Combining Lowe&#x2019;s measurements with those from 21 skulls in the Te Papa collection (C. Miskelly unpubl.), four <em>Coenocorypha</em> snipe species had bills of the following lengths (mm): <em>C. chathamica</em> mean 71, min 62, max 77, sample size = 14; <em>C. aucklandica</em> mean 70, min 68, max 74, sample size = 4; <em>C. huegeli</em> mean 60, min 57, max 64, sample size = 3; <em>C. pusilla</em> mean 54, min 51, max 55, sample size = 11.

Birds are occasionally seen on Pitt Island. Apart from Pitt Island, all these islands are now free of introduced mammals, and snipe are abundant anywhere that has dense ground cover. Important habitats include <em>Carex</em> sedge under open forest, <em>Muehlenbeckia</em> vinelands, rank grass (both exotic and indigenous), and regenerating shrubland.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>About 1300 birds estimated on 249 ha Rangatira Island. Assuming similar densities on the four smaller islands (combined area 150 ha), the total population is likely to be about 2000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Snipe are presumed to have been extirpated by Pacific rats on Chatham Island between 1500 and 1800 A.D., and by feral cats on Pitt Island by the late 1800s. The species was first discovered in 1869, on 131 ha Mangere Island. Snipe disappeared from Mangere Island about 1900, soon after the introduction of cats there. For many years believed confined to Rangatira Island, snipe were discovered on Star Keys (c.10 ha) in 1974. Following the eradication of cats on Mangere Island, 23 snipe were reintroduced from Rangatira Island in 1970. They have thrived, and from there have colonised nearby Little Mangere Island (19 ha) and Rabbit Island (2 ha). Twenty snipe from Rangatira Island were released into a predator-fenced conservation covenant on Pitt Island in 2008, but apparently dispersed within a year.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island snipe have a long breeding season, with eggs laid from late July to early April. The two large pinkish-brown eggs speckled with dark brown are concealed in a ground-level nest, usually among or under sedges, grass or other vegetation. Both sexes share incubation, which takes 18-20 days. The chicks leave the nest on the day of hatching, with the male caring for the first chick to leave the nest, and the female the second. Both of the parent-chick pairs forage independently of each other during chick-rearing, Chatham Island snipe are typically encountered as pairs &#x2013; either a breeding pair or an&#xA0;adult with a dependent chick.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island snipe can be seen foraging at any time of day or night. Although present throughout vegetated areas, they are most easily seen under forest on Rangatira and Mangere Islands. Here they are encountered as singles, breeding pairs, or parent-chick pairs, moving quietly over the forest floor. The usual feeding method is to probe a small area intensively, then to scuttle forward before probing a new area. Food is passed from bill-tip to bill-tip, both from adult to chick, and male to female when courtship feeding. At night they venture into more open areas, including coastal saltmarsh, where they would be vulnerable to harrier and skua predation in daylight. Chatham Island snipe rarely fly during the day unless startled. On clear moonlit nights they are often heard in flight, including performing the hakawai display. This spectacular display has never been seen being performed. It starts with a series of calls identical to the high-intensity male territorial display &#x2018;queeyoo queeyoo&#x2019; repeated several times, followed by a loud roar made with the tail feathers as the bird swoops over the forest canopy. The display causes characteristic damage to the tail feathers, readily observable when birds are handled.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Soil-dwelling invertebrates obtained by probing.

Between 1953 and 2010 it was considered a subspecies of what is now called the subantarctic snipe. Genetic comparisons then confirmed earlier suggestions that the Snares Islands birds were structurally distinct from the snipe found on islands further south. Naturally confined to a tiny island group, the Snares Island snipe has never been impacted by introduced predators. Following a translocation to Putauhinu Island in 2005 (to replace the extinct South Island snipe), and subsequent translocations to other islands near Stewart Island, the Snares Island snipe is probably more abundant than at any time in its evolutionary history.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Snares Island snipe are unmistakeable within their range, as there are no other similar-sized ground birds present. Compared to other living New Zealand snipes, Snares Island snipe are chunkier, with a relatively short bill and legs. They also differ in having barred feathers on the belly, and less variegated dorsal plumage. Males usually have clearer buff edges to their dorsal feather than females, and also tend to have yellowish legs (cf. greenish in the female). Juveniles are duller than adults, with the plumage washed with grey, and legs olive.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice (adult male): a strident chup chup chup sometimes building to a loud queeyoo queeyoo queeyoo.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Snares Island snipe occur on North East Island (280 ha), Broughton Island (48 ha) and Alert Stack (5 ha) in the Snares Islands. They have been introduced successfully to Putauhinu Island (141 ha), a muttonbird island 107 km to the north-east, and (in December 2012 and 2016) to Codfish Island. On all these islands snipe occur most abundantly in areas with dense ground cover, including <em>Poa</em> tussock grasslands, and <em>Polystichum</em> fern under forest. The forest on the Snares Islands is predominantly subantarctic tree daisy (<em>Olearia lyalli</em>), and on Putauhinu a mix of <em>Olearia</em> species, southern rata, and <em>Hebe elliptica</em>. On the Snares Islands, snipe venture into more open areas at night, probing in dense swards of <em>Callitriche antarctica</em> and <em>Crassula moschata</em>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;<strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The Snares Islands population is about 400 pairs (c.1000 adults), and there were at least 320 birds estimated to be present on Putauhinu Island in 2011. Snipe have been recorded at densities up to 10 birds per hectare on North East Island. However, densities are much lower in areas with little ground cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Snares Island snipe are one of the few New Zealand bird species that had no recognised impacts from humans &#x2013; until a positive impact in 2005. No introduced mammal species ever established on the Snares Islands, which retained their original vegetation almost intact. However, the entire populations of snipe and two other endemic landbirds (tomtit and fernbird) would be threatened by a single rat invasion. This was a major factor in the decision to release 30 Snares Island snipe on Putauhinu Island in 2005, where they filled the niche vacated by the extinct South Island snipe (last recorded on adjacent Big South Cape Island in 1964). Snares Island snipe were subsequently translocated to Codfish Island/Whenua Hou (2012 &amp; 2016), Kundy (2015 &amp; 2017) and Mokinui Islands (2017), and are vagrant to other nearby muttonbird islands.&#xA0;Access to the Snares Islands Nature Reserve and Codfish Island/Whenua Hou Nature Reserve&#xA0;is strictly controlled by the Department of Conservation, and only a few families have the rights to visit Putauhinu, Kundy and Mokinui&#xA0;Islands to gather muttonbirds (sooty shearwater chicks). It is hoped that future translocations will include to sites with public access.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding </strong></p>\n<p>Snares Island snipe mainly breed between November and March, laying two large eggs in a well-concealed nest at ground level. Both sexes incubate the eggs and share care of the chicks, with the male caring for the first chick to leave the nest, and the female the second. Chicks leave the nest on the day of hatching, and are cared for by one of their parents for 8-11 weeks. Each parent-chick pair is completely independent of the other, and if either adult loses its chick, it may attempt to breed again with a new mate. However, the original pair typically re-unite by the start of the next breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Snares Island snipe are typically seen in pairs &#x2013; either courting adults, or adults caring for a single chick. The genus <em>Coenocorypha</em> is unique in the family Scolopacidae as its species are the only members that have courtship feeding. Males feed the females for the 3 weeks before egg-laying, providing some of the nutrients needed to form the large eggs. Adults also feed the chicks, with the chicks not starting to feed themselves until about 2 weeks old. Snares Island snipe can be seen foraging at any time of day or night, probing rapidly until they detect food, then plunging the bill in deeper to catch it. Most food is swallowed while the bill is still inserted, but larger items are extracted and manipulated before swallowing. On sunny afternoons, singles and pairs may sleep in a patch of sun among dense vegetation. During heavy rain they often shelter under the impenetrable cover of <em>Polystichum</em> ferns. Snares Island snipe have never been heard to perform the nocturnal &#x2018;hakawai&#x2019; aerial display given by other <em>Coenocorypha</em> snipe. However, tail-feather wear believed to be caused by the display was seen on two of the males translocated to Putauhinu Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Snares Island snipe get all their food by probing in soil and mud, consuming a wide variety of the invertebrates found there. Major prey items include amphipods (hoppers), earthworms, adult beetles, and the larvae and pupae of flies and beetles.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snares_Snipe\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snares_Snipe</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wading-birds/6\">www.teara.govt.nz/en/wading-birds/6</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Baker, A.J.; Miskelly, C.M.; Haddrath, O. 2010.

Well camouflaged and staying among dense vegetation, they are easily over-looked compared to the showy albatrosses and penguins that they share their islands with. However, for discerning naturalists visiting Enderby Island (in the Auckland Islands) or Campbell Island, sighting a snipe is one of the highlights of their visit. The subantarctic snipe species includes both the first New Zealand snipe to be discovered, and the most recent. The Auckland Island subspecies was discovered on Enderby Island in November 1840 during the <em>Erebus &amp; Terror</em> expedition under Captain James Clark Ross. The Campbell Island subspecies was not known to exist before a chance discovery on sheer-sided 20 ha Jacquemart Island in 1997. Following the eradication of rats on Campbell Island in 2001, this critically endangered form naturally recolonised the main island, completing a remarkable story of discovery and recovery within less than a decade.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The only snipe species known from Auckland, Antipodes and Campbell Islands, although Japanese snipe is a possible vagrant. Subantarctic snipe have relatively longer bills and legs than other New Zealand snipe species. Their coloration is similar to the much smaller Chatham Island snipe, with variegated brown and blackish dorsal feathers with clear buff edges, and largely unmarked off-white belly feathers. The three subspecies differ slightly in size and markings. The Auckland Island snipe has by far the greatest genetic variation, and this is mirrored in the variation in their size and plumage. Birds from Adams Island are smaller than those from the Port Ross islands (including Enderby and Rose Islands), and some birds from all islands show more rufous dorsally, especially on the rump. Antipodes Island snipe are darker than Auckland Island birds above, and their plumage is more yellow than all other populations, especially ventrally. The Campbell Island snipe is the smallest subspecies. It has the darkest back feathers, and a pinkish-buff cast to the belly feathers. Most populations have pale yellow legs, but Antipodes Island snipe have grey legs.</p>\n<p>Voice: a strident &#x2018;chup chup&#x2019; similar to other New Zealand snipes, mostly heard at night. All populations perform the nocturnal hakawai aerial display (see Behaviour and ecology).</p>\n<p>Similar species: Chatham Island snipe is much smaller with a shorter bill. Snares Island snipe is darker overall, has a stockier build, and has barred belly feathers. Japanese snipe is larger with longer wings and legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Auckland Islands (Adams, Disappointment, Enderby, Ewing, Rose and Ocean Islands), Antipodes Island (Antipodes, Bollons, Archway and Inner Windward Islands, probably also Leeward Island), and Campbell Island (Campbell and Jacquemart Islands). Found throughout vegetated areas, including tussock grasslands, herbfields, fern, shrubland and low forest. Absent from main Auckland Island, which has feral pigs and cats present. Snipe or sign of their presence have been recorded on two other small islands in the Auckland Islands (Dundas and Figure-of-Eight Islands), but these are unlikely to sustain permanent populations.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Few estimates are available. Encounter rates on Adams Island (mean 0.61 birds per hour) were more than three times higher than in similar habitat on Antipodes Island (0.18 birds per hour), where snipe coexist with mice. Adams Island (10,119 ha) is likely to hold tens of thousands of birds, based on recorded densities of at least 4 birds per hectare on other islands. About 30 snipe were estimated to be present on Campbell Island in 2006, but this colonising population has spread to occupy a much greater area since, and the population&apos;s threat ranking was &apos;down-graded&apos; from Nationally Critical to Nationally Vulnerable in 2017. The total area occupied by the species is about 11,540 ha in the Auckland Islands, 2060 ha in the Antipodes Islands, and about 5000 ha on Campbell Island (with a total of 11,290 ha available there to colonise).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Subantarctic snipe thrive in the absence of introduced mammals, and are scarce or absent in their presence. Norway rats eliminated snipe from Campbell Island, and cats and pigs extirpated snipe from Auckland Island. Snipe were scarce or absent in the former presence of cattle, rabbits and mice on Enderby Island, and rabbits on Rose Island. Following pest mammal eradications on three of these islands, snipe are now abundant on Enderby and Rose Islands, and have recolonised Campbell Island from Jacquemart Island. Eradication of pigs and cats on Auckland Island would be of great benefit to snipe, as would eradication of mice from Antipodes and Auckland Islands. Mouse eradication was attempted on Antipodes Island in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Poorly known. All nests found contained 1 or 2 eggs. The two nests with single eggs (Auckland Islands) were not visited subsequently to determine if a second egg was laid. Incubation is shared, and it is likely that each adult cares for one chick independent of its mate, as almost all family groups encountered were a single adult with a single chick.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Subantarctic snipe are typically encountered as single birds, courting pairs, or single adults caring for a single dependent chick. They keep to dense vegetation during daylight, sometimes roosting in sunny spots on warm days. Subantarctic snipe are most often seen when disturbed at close range, when they rise a few metres on whirring wings and fly up to 50 metres before pitching down into cover. At night all populations are more vocal, and all have been heard performing the hakawai aerial display (a mix of vocal and non-vocal sounds). The non-vocal component is a roar made by vibrating tail feathers as the birds dive at speed. Damage caused to tail feathers by the display is readily seen on birds in the hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Soil-dwelling invertebrates obtained by probing.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic_Snipe\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic_Snipe</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wading-birds/6\">www.teara.govt.nz/en/wading-birds/6</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Baker, A.J.; Miskelly, C.M.; Haddrath, O. 2010.

Considerably larger than the endemic <em>Coenocorypha</em> snipes, the Japanese snipe is the only <em>Gallinago</em> snipe so far recorded in New Zealand.

Nondescript for much of the year, in February and March they moult into a rich reddish breeding plumage, hence their name used in most of the world, the red knot. The &#x2018;lesser&#x2019; name is a comparison with the related great knot.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The lesser knot is a medium-sized wader, plain grey above and white below in non-breeding plumage. The bill is dark and of medium length, and the legs range from yellowish as juveniles to dark grey as adults. The rump is lightly barred white. Juveniles have buffier underparts than adults, and dark subterminal bands on the mantle and scapular feathers. In flight, lesser knots show a pale wingbar on the upperwing. In breeding plumage the mantle and scapulars become variably dark-centred with red patches, and the belly, breast and face become reddish. In the subspecies <em>rogersi</em> the breeding plumage feathers of the upperparts are largely grey-fringed, whereas the subspecies <em>piersmai</em> has more extensively red and black feathering, and a redder hindneck. Lesser knots feed in flocks with a rapid &#x2018;sewing-machine&#x2019; action.</p>\n<p>Voice: lesser knots are generally quiet. They give a soft <em>chuk</em> while feeding, and a more strident <em>weet-weet</em> before migration.</p>\n<p>Similar species: non-breeding great knots are larger, with darker streaks on the breast, clearer &#x2018;vee&#x2019; markings on the flanks, a finely streaked forehead, whiter rump, and a longer and heavier bill. Single red knots can, however, be quite confusing, especially when there are no other birds present for size comparisons.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The commonest subspecies in New Zealand, <em>rogersi</em>, breeds on Chukotka Peninsula in far-eastern Russia. In recent years it has become evident that New Zealand also hosts birds of the subspecies <em>piersmai</em>, which breeds further west on the New Siberian Islands. <em>C.c. piersmai</em> winters principally in northern and north-west Australia, while <em>rogersi </em>winters mostly in eastern Australia and New Zealand. Red knots are found widely around the large harbours and estuaries of the North Island of New Zealand (but only a few in the Waikato), but in the South Island good numbers occur only in the northern South Island (especially Farewell Spit) and Southland. They are regular on Chatham Island; vagrant to Kermadec, Auckland, Campbell and Macquarie Islands. Lesser knots are found mainly at sites with extensive sandflats or mudflats. They roost on shellbanks and sandspits, usually with other waders such as godwits.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The East Asian-Australasian Flyway population has probably been overestimated in the past, and there may be fewer than 120,000 lesser knots wintering in Australia and New Zealand. The New Zealand population has declined from almost 60,000 in the early 1990s to about 30,000 in the 2010s. The global population is around 900,000 birds across six breeding regions. About 10% of the New Zealand summer population remains there in winter. These are immature birds aged 1-3 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>During their northward migration, lesser knots from both New Zealand and Australia concentrate at Bohai Bay in the western Yellow Sea of China, where tidal flat reclamation pressure is immense. No other major sites are known on migration, and it is likely that the majority of the flyway&#x2019;s knots occur there. There is extreme concern about the impact of reclamation there on red knots of both subspecies. In New Zealand, while tidal flats are relatively secure, human impacts on roosting sites may be detrimental. The conservation status of this species was changed from Migrant to Nationally Vulnerable in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Lesser knots breed as monogamous pairs on high Arctic tundra. The clutch of 4 eggs is laid in a lichen-lined depression on the ground, incubation is shared, and the precocial young leave the nest soon after hatching. Chick-rearing is shared to a degree, but one mate (probably the female) leaves the clutch to the other mate before the chicks have fledged.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The lesser knot is a long-distance migrant, but precise details of its migrations in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway are lacking. Birds leave New Zealand through March and early April, and tracking has shown that while some birds migrate direct to China, others make an intermediate stopover in northern Australia or nearby regions (Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea). Birds migrate up the east Asian coast from Taiwan to the Yellow Sea before heading to their Russian breeding grounds. A similar route is taken on the way south, with some birds moving to eastern or south-eastern Australia before crossing the Tasman Sea to New Zealand. Juveniles appear to visit Australia first before trickling through to New Zealand through the southern summer, or to stay in Australia for a year or so then relocating to New Zealand. Adults arrive in New Zealand from mid-September onwards.</p>\n<p>Lesser knots often form dense flocks both on the ground and in the air, and they are known globally for their swirling aerial manoeuvres. In New Zealand they often roost near bar-tailed godwits.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Lesser knots mainly eat small molluscs, especially bivalve shellfish, which are swallowed whole and crushed by a muscular gizzard. Important prey in New Zealand include pipi (<em>Paphies australis</em>), cockles/tuangi (<em>Austrovenus stutchburyi</em>), and nutshells (<em>Nucula hartvigiana</em>). They feed on open flats as well as seagrass beds, feeding principally by tactile means (probing, probably involving a remote pressure sense) but they also peck visually for surface prey such as gastropods. They can feed on small amphipods where prey densities are high enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Knot\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Knot</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/knot.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/knot.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Higgins, P.J.; Davies, S.J.J.F.

In breeding plumage, however, the great knot is unmistakeable, with a spotted black breast and bold red patches on the scapulars. A Russian-breeding species that winters mostly in Australia, the great knot is a near-annual visitor to New Zealand in small numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The great knot is intermediate in size between a lesser knot and a small bar-tailed godwit. Its key identification characters are a slightly thick, tapering bill that is noticeably longer than the head, a finely streaked rather than clean supercilium (eyebrow stripe), dense streaking on the forehead, a dark-spotted breast, distinct &apos;vee&apos; markings along the flanks, and in flight, a whitish rump. In non-breeding plumage, the upperpart feathers have slightly darker centres than those of lesser knots, so their backs appear more varied in tone. In breeding plumage their breasts become blackish, the flank &apos;vees&apos; more prominent, and the plain mantle and scapular feathers of the upperparts are replaced by bold black-and-red feathering, initially with broad grey fringes that wear off over time. A pale wingbar on the upperwing is shorter than that of lesser knot. Juveniles have white-fringed or -notched upperpart feathers with darkish centres, and only a lightly streaked breast. Most of these distinctive upperpart feathers may be replaced by non-breeding plumage before any such juveniles reach New Zealand.</p>\n<p>Voice: generally silent. A bird at the Manawatu estuary was video recorded giving a &#x2018;kreep&#x2019; call while with lesser knots. [Video of bird calling at Manawatu estuary: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB9JlOkq3Xc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB9JlOkq3Xc</a>.]</p>\n<p>Similar species: great knots can be overlooked amongst flocks of lesser knots in New Zealand, but given good views can be told by breast pattern, head pattern and bill size, and rump colour.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Great knots breed on rocky mountains across a broad swath of north-eastern Siberia. They migrate to non-breeding grounds from the Middle East to Australia, where they frequent large intertidal areas for feeding and adjacent beaches for roosting.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The world population of great knots is about 290,000 birds, down from earlier estimates of 380,000. In New Zealand, singles or small numbers occur regularly, and have been recorded from the Kaipara Harbour to Lake Ellesmere. Birds are frequently recorded from the Manawatu estuary, though whether that is due to great knots favouring the site or birds being more readily observed there is not clear.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Great knots migrate in long flights from the non-breeding grounds to Asia, where they congregate in groups of up to 50,000 at key sites around the Yellow Sea. One such site, Saemangeum in South Korea, was enclosed by a large dyke for reclamation in 2006; monitoring documented a 93% decline from 2006-2011. In total it is estimated that 104,000 great knots were lost from 2006-2013. It is likely that this single reclamation caused a drop of a quarter of the world population of this species.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Great knots breed as monogamous pairs at low densities in mountain tundra in rocky areas. The clutch of 4 eggs is laid in a lichen-lined depression on the ground. Incubation is shared but females leave the males to raise the chicks. Young leave the nest soon after hatching.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology </strong></p>\n<p>The great knot is a long-distance migrant that probably migrates from Australia direct to the Yellow Sea region of Asia on northward migration. Some birds stop-over at the entrance to the Yellow Sea before carrying on to the Korean Peninsula or the northern shores of the Yellow Sea. Many probably migrate direct from Asia to their Russian breeding grounds, though large numbers (~40,000) have been observed on the Moroshechnaya estuary, Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) on northward migration.&#xA0;Birds&#xA0;use the coasts of the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia before migrating to the Yellow Sea again on the way south.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>No New Zealand data.

The first record of galahs in New Zealand was from Clevedon in 1959, with many records from 1975 on. Galah are localised in distribution, with the only wild population spread widely over the South Auckland area, including a breeding population on Ponui Island in the Hauraki Gulf. They mainly feed on the ground, eating seeds of grasses, herbs and crops. The largest flocks recorded in New Zealand were feeding on maize stubble.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Galahs are small cockatoos, with a slim frame and narrow wings suitable for fast and agile flight. Feathers on the back, tail and dorsal surface of the wings are grey, darker at the tips of the flight feathers of the wings and tail. The neck, breast, and underside of the wings are bright pink to almost red. The short crest is normally laid back appearing as a pale cap. The beak is pale grey. The iris is brown in males and red in females. Juveniles have duller plumage, with pink areas suffused with grey. Galah are gregarious, with large unstable flocks made up of pairs and small social groups that congregate to feed and roost.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Voice: a distinctive high pitched call described as &#x201C;<em>chill chill</em>&#x201D; given in flight. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">There is no similar species in New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Galahs are widespread throughout Australia. The New Zealand population covers an area from Wellsford south to Mangatawhiri and west to Pukekohe. Their stronghold is Ponui Island in the Hauraki Gulf, and they range to nearby islands as far north as Rakino Island and Tiritiri Matangi, including the eastern end of Waiheke Island. Historical records from the Manawatu and Rangitikei Districts reportedly followed the release of cage birds from a ship that grounded off the coast. This population no longer exists. Free-ranging pets and cage escapes occur elsewhere.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">In Australia, galahs mainly occur in open habitats, and are often seen in agricultural grassland and among crops. The few published records from New Zealand are from rolling hill country, with cropping interspersed with extensive pastoral farming and native and exotic forest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Galahs are uncommon and localised in New Zealand, with probably fewer than 100 individuals present. A flock of up to 50 birds formerly occurred on Ponui Island, but is currently less than half this size. The population is probably limited by live-capture for the pet trade</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Galahs mainly eat seeds of introduced pasture and cereal crop species. Their impact on agriculture is generally localised, with flocks targeting specific fields of maize on a few properties. Their impact on native species is unknown.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">In Australia, galahs nest in tree cavities, laying clutches of 2-8 eggs. Large clutches may be the result of two females laying in the same nest. Both parents incubate the eggs and raise the chicks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Galahs are gregarious forming large flocks that, in Australia, may constitute thousands of individuals. They are fast and agile fliers and may range over a large area. The little recorded information on this species in New Zealand suggests their preferred habitat is farmland and exotic forestry. Their range encompasses the extensive native and exotic forests of the Hunua Range, through to the intensive arable areas south of Auckland and the extremely diverse vegetation around Auckland city.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Galahs usually forage on the ground, eating seeds and rhizomes of pasture grasses and herbs. To a much lesser extent they also forage in trees. In New Zealand they have been recorded in exotic tree plantations, but there are no details of food species or parts of plants consumed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://galah.galahs.com.au/\">http://galah.galahs.com.au/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galah\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galah</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MERWlvl1\" align=\"left\">Higgins, P.J.

They have been introduced to many other countries, where they often form large flocks in city parks. Rose-ringed parakeets are not considered to be established in the wild in New Zealand. Illegal releases of aviary birds in the northern North Island have produced short-lived feral populations that have so far been contained, mainly through live-trapping. The rose-ringed parakeet is considered a horticultural and conservation pest species, and is an unwanted organism under the Biosecurity Act. If you think you have seen a rose-ringed parakeet, phone the Ministry for Primary Industries Pests and Diseases Hotline 0800 80 99 66.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Rose-ringed parakeets are medium-sized, long-winged and long-tailed, pale green parrots with large, bright red beaks. The central tail feathers are twice the length of the rest of the long tail, creating a graduated or attenuated shape. The long, pointed wings are also distinctive in flight. Females and immatures are entirely green apart from yellowish undertail and greyish undersides to the primaries and secondaries, creating a broad grey rear half to the underwing. Males are similar but with the addition of head markings that include a narrow black stripe curving under the cheek from the black chin, tapering to a fine point towards the nape, bordered below by a narrow, pale pink band that extends around the nape (the &#x2018;rose-ring&#x2019;), and above by a broader pale blue band across the hind-crown. Males may also have blue central tail feathers. Many colour mutations exist in cage birds, including birds that are pale blue. The similar-looking Alexandrine parakeet (<em>Psittacula eupatria</em>) has the same colouration as typical rose-ringed parakeets but is larger, with a relatively larger beak, and a small brownish patch on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>Voice: loud screeching <em>kee-ak...kee-ak</em>; shrill <em>ak-ak-ak</em> when alarmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>No viable wild populations are known in New Zealand. Most New Zealand sightings were of single birds, pairs and small flocks seen between North Auckland and Canterbury. Sightings have included Beachlands, South Auckland, where they bred (eradicated 2005-06), Okere Falls, Rotorua (at least 5 birds including a fledgling, from 2007, eradication attempted&#xA0;2012, birds still present early 2015), Havelock North (from 2010, eradication attempted 2016), Tamahere, Hamilton (at least 2 birds, 2013), Hikutia, north of Paeroa (at least 15 birds, 2011-14, 12 birds captured or shot 2014-15), Takapuna (4 birds, 2015), and Christchurch (2016,30 birds released during a fire at a zoo, with most subsequently recaptured). There have also been sightings of single birds at Willowbank, Christchurch (2010),&#xA0;Te Atatu, Auckland (2014), and Masterton (2014-15). If rose-ringed parakeets become established in New Zealand, they could occupy urban and horticultural areas throughout the country. Elsewhere, rose-ringed parakeets occur up to 2000 m altitude, and they thrive in areas that experience winter snow (Himalayan foothills and European cities).</p>\n<p>The natural range of the rose-ringed parakeet includes India, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Two other subspecies occur in a belt across sub-Saharan North Africa. They have been introduced into many countries, mainly as cage-escaped populations centred on major cities, including London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Cologne, Bonn, Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Lisbon, Tripoli, Ankara, Tehran, Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore. Also introduced to many other countries including South Africa, Mauritius, Lebanon, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Taiwan, Japan, USA, West Indies and Venezuela. </p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>No viable populations are known in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic and conservation impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The main reasons that efforts are made to eradicate rose-ringed parakeets in New Zealand is to eliminate any potential threat to agriculture and horticulture, and to reduce the risk of parrot-specific diseases that they may carry infecting native parrots, including kakapo. They can occur in large flocks, and in India are considered one of the most destructive pests of cereal, nut and fruit crops. Rose-ringed parakeets could also compete for nest holes with native hole-nesting species. They may be kept in secure aviaries and cages, but it is illegal to release rose-ringed parakeets to the wild.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Few data from wild New Zealand birds. Two chicks were captured in a nest under a garage roof in Maraetai-Beachlands in 2006, and young birds had been seen flying with adults the previous year. In England, rose-ringed parakeets are mainly spring breeders, nesting inside holes in living or dead trees (sometimes in holes in rock faces or ruined walls). They breed as monogamous pairs, with incubation by the female. Both sexes feed nestlings and fledglings. Incubation of the usually 3-4, whitish eggs takes 22 days, and the nestling period is about 7 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Rose-ringed parakeets are fast-flying and noisy, and may occur in large sociable flocks once established. They are one of the few parrots to adapt to urban habitats. Feeding flocks often number dozens of birds, which fly tens of kilometres to communal nocturnal roosts in large trees. Roosting flocks may number in the thousands.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Rose-ringed parakeets feed mainly on seeds and fruit in the outer canopy of trees, but will descend to cereal crops and feeding tables. A wide range of fruits, nuts, berries, seeds, nectar, flower petals, buds and other vegetable matter is taken.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose-ringed_parakeet\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose-ringed_parakeet</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/responding/alerts/indian-ringneck-parakeet/\">https://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/responding/alerts/indian-ringneck-parakeet/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J.

Both populations are believed to have died out.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crimson rosellas are similar in shape to eastern rosellas, with the same long tail common to all rosellas. They are slightly larger, however, and have very different plumage. Most of the body is rich crimson, including the head and chest. They have striking violet&#x2013;blue cheek patches. The upper back is mottled with black, and the shoulders are light blue. The flight feathers are dark blue to black, and the tail is dark blue, lighter blue underneath, with small white tips on the outer feathers. Females are slightly duller than males, and may have a white under-wing bar. Juveniles are mainly bright olive-green, with a red forehead, breast and undertail, and blue cheek patches. Their flight is like that of the eastern rosella, direct and undulating.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: frequent calls include the harsh brassy &#x201C;<em>klee klee klee</em>&#x201D; made when flying, &#x201C;<em>kwik-kweeek-kwik</em>&#x201D; piping notes often made when perched, and a soft chatter.&#xA0;These calls are are similar to those of eastern rosella, but differ in pitch.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: adults are unmistakable. Juveniles have some resemblance to eastern rosella and red-crowned parakeet, but note the blue cheek patches (white in eastern rosella, absent in red-crowned parakeet), and red on chest and under-tail (absent in red-crowned parakeet).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&#xA0;<strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first wild population of crimson rosella established around Dunedin c.1910. This population reportedly hybridised with eastern rosella (which were released in the area at the same time), and apparently died out, or were absorbed into the eastern rosella population, in the 1960s. &#xA0;Another small population established in the western and northwestern suburbs of Wellington around 1963. Occasional sightings from elsewhere in the country over the years, including the Tararua Ranges in 1971, are most likely individual cage-escapees. In 1996 Heather &amp; Robertson estimated the Wellington population at fewer than 20 individuals. It is likely that this species is now extinct in the wild in New Zealand. Also introduced to Norfolk Island, where it is common.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In their natural range, crimson rosellas use a variety of forested habitats from sea level to subalpine areas. They are most common in mature, wetter forests, but also inhabit open woodlands and urban parks, gardens and golf courses. The Wellington population was most frequently seen in the Botanical Gardens and other areas of parkland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crimson rosellas are probably extinct in the wild in New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crimson rosellas damage orchards in their native range. They have had considerable negative ecological impacts on Norfolk Island, where they compete with the endangered Norfolk Island green parrot for nest cavities.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crimson rosellas are cavity-nesters, using exisiting holes in tree trunks and branches to nest in, often very high off the ground. Pairs defend small areas around their chosen nest site during the breeding season. They form monogamous bonds, with pairs staying together over many breeding seasons. Females incubate the eggs (a clutch of 5 is typical) and brood the chicks, with both parents feeding the young. In their native range, the breeding season runs from September through to early February. Typically they raise just one brood per season<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The behaviour of the crimson rosella is similar to that of the eastern rosella. It is a noisy, gregarious species, frequently chasing one another. Much of their aggressive behaviour is ritualised, including the tail-wagging display accompanied by noisy chatter and beak clattering. Observations of crimson rosellas in New Zealand have typically been of pairs or individual birds. In Australia, adult birds are similarly found in their mated pairs, however juveniles and subadults will form slightly larger loose flocks (5-6 birds on average) in cooler months. Flocks of up to 100 birds have been recorded. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crimson rosellas mainly eat seeds, but they also consume a variety of other plant material including fruit, nectar, shoots, buds, and leaves. Some invertebrates are taken, particularly during the breeding season. They sometimes feed on the ground, but more often in trees and shrubs, typically foraging in pairs or small flocks. Crimson rosellas join mixed flocks with other parrot species in their native range, and some come to feeders in urban areas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Rosella\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Rosella</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hamel, J. 1970.

It was introduced to New Zealand in the early 1900s, and is now common over much of the North Island, with a smaller population centred on Dunedin. They typically move around the landscape in pairs or small flocks, often given away by their noisy chatter or loud, in-flight alarm call. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eastern rosella are easily identified by their bright red heads, with white cheek patches. The red extends down onto the chest and forms a &#x201C;bib&#x201D;, giving way to a yellow belly. The upper back is yellow to green, with black patches in the centre of each feather. The rump is bright green, often observed when they are flying away. The upperwings are dark blue with bright blue shoulders. They have long tails, almost equal in length to the rest of their body &#x2013; dark green in the centre, becoming light blue toward the outside. Males are typically brighter in colour than females. Juveniles are duller than adult birds, and their plumage is more green than yellow. The green also extends up the back of the neck into the crown of the head, and their cheek patches may be pale blue. In juveniles, and variably in adult females, a white bar is present on the underside of the wing, which may be seen in flight.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: up to 25 different calls have been described for eastern rosella. Most frequently heard are the unparrotlike&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;pee-ping&#x201D;</em> contact call, reminiscent of a bellbird;&#xA0;the in-flight alarm call &#x2013; a metallic <em>&#x201C;pink pink pink pink&#x201D;</em>, and the noisy parroty chatter associated with intraspecific interactions. Juveniles and nestlings near fledging have a distinct <em>&#x201C;choy choy choy&#x201D;</em> call. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: eastern rosellas are often confused with rainbow lorikeet (<em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em>), another Australian parrot that has been the focus of eradication efforts around Auckland (and not considered established in the wild in New Zealand). Rainbow lorikeets, a listed pest species, are distinguished by their blue heads and bright red beaks, and their contact call is a more piercing screech/whistle. Crimson rosellas formerly present in small numbers in Wellington city are easily distinguished as adults, but juveniles are predominantly green and red. All ages differ in having blue cheek patches (cf. white in eastern rosellas).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eastern rosellas are native to south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania. They were introduced to New Zealand in the early 1900s, beginning with&#xA0;Dunedin in 1910, then Auckland (around 1920) and Wellington in the 1960s. The South Island population has remained relatively small, confined to the Dunedin area. There are isolated records from Lyttleton Harbour, Invercargill, and Stewart Island. The two North Island populations have spread considerably, and are almost joined in the Rangitikei region. Eastern rosella are now common throughout many parts of the North Island, in particular Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Wairarapa and Wellington. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eastern rosellas are mainly seen in open, partially wooded landscapes in New Zealand, including urban parks, gardens, golf courses, farmland, wetlands, and stands of exotic and native trees. They use the edges of extensive native forest areas more than the interior. Individuals can move widely across the landscape to find and exploit certain food resources, and their home ranges often encompass several habitat types. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The eastern rosella is an abundant species that continues to spread in the North Island. No population estimates are available.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eastern rosellas could potentially have detrimental effects for native parrots through spreading parrot-specific disease organisms not otherwise present. North Island rosella populations have been found to carry Beak and Feather Disease Virus (BFDV), a parrot specific virus which could be harmful to native parrots. Additionally, they may compete with native species for food and/or tree cavities, which they nest in. Rosellas cause localised damage to grain and fruit crops in New Zealand, including stripping flowers from some fruit trees.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eastern rosellas are cavity nesters &#x2013; using holes in tree trunks or branches as nest sites. They form monogamous pairs, which remain together over multiple breeding seasons. From the end of August onward there is increased aggressive behaviour among individuals as loose flocks split into pairs. Pairs begin searching for suitable nest sites as early as September, inspecting potential cavities together. When a suitable site is found, pairs defend the area up to 30 m around the cavity. Eggs (4&#x2013;7 in a clutch) are laid from October onward, typically one clutch per season, but two if conditions are favourable. The female alone incubates, but is fed by the male near the nest. For the first 2 weeks after hatching the female alone broods the chicks and feeds them. The male directly assists with &#xA0;feeding chicks for the remaining 2 weeks before fledging.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A gregarious species, eastern rosella are often loud and conspicuous. Interactions between pairs in the breeding season are usually noisy and aggressive, with birds chattering at and chasing each other, and performing the agonistic &#x201C;tail-wagging&#x201D; display. However, they are often on the losing end of interactions with other bird species in New Zealand (e.g. tui, kingfisher, myna and starling). In winter, pairs and juveniles form loose flocks of 8&#x2013;20 individuals (52 have been observed in a single flock near Wellington). Flocks forage together on open ground. Eastern rosella have been observed feeding with red-crowned parakeets in a mixed flock on the ground. They are a very wary bird, particularly of people, and will take flight quickly if disturbed, flying swiftly with characteristic undulating flight.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Seeds are a major component of the diet of eastern rosella. They also consume fruit, nectar, shoots, buds, leaves, and invertebrates (particularly during the breeding season). They often feed on the ground, but will also feed in trees. Birds forage alone or in pairs in the breeding season, and in small flocks in the winter. They have been observed feeding on the seeds of many native plants including flax, totara, and pohutukawa, and on the nectar from puriri flowers &#x2013; destroying the flower in the process.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_rosella\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_rosella</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/easternrosella.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/easternrosella.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brereton, J.L. 1963.

Although they are widely distributed throughout the New Zealand region, and very common on some islands, they are almost entirely absent from the two main islands. One exception is&#xA0;Wellington city, where birds dispersing from Zealandia and Matiu/Somes Islands are occasionally seen in suburban gardens. Red-crowned parakeets occupy a variety of habitats ranging from tall forests to grass and shrublands. In the late 1800s, this species sometimes occurred in large flocks with two other species of <em>Cyanoramphus </em>parakeets, causing considerable damage to orchards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-crowned parakeets are medium-sized, long-tailed parrots with broad, rounded wings and predominantly emerald green plumage. They have a crimson forehead and fore-crown, and patches of the same colour behind the eyes and on each flank, at the base of the tail. The leading edge of the primary wing feathers are a rich cyan blue of varying extent depending on subspecies. Males are larger than females. Their flight appears to be erratic when crossing open spaces, but they are capable of crossing open ocean in excess of 100 km.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a characteristic parakeet chatter, with variety of softer <em>tur-tur-tur</em> calls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: where parakeet distribution overlaps, field identification can be difficult. A good view of crown colouration is the only reliable feature. Other differences are subtle, including plumage tone (bluish-green to yellowish-green), the width and intensity of blue on the wings, and slight difference in the pitch of calls, with the larger red-crowned parakeet having a lower pitched call than those of yellow-crowned parakeets.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Formerly common throughout New Zealand, red-crowned parakeets are now largely restricted to pest-free offshore and outlying islands, from the Kermadec Islands east to the Chatham Islands and south to the Auckland Islands. Occasional mainland sightings are likely to be vagrants, released or escaped captive birds, or birds dispersing from nearby offshore islands or pest-free mainland reserves. Locally common on pest-free offshore islands from sub-tropical Kermadec Islands (especially Raoul and Macauley Islands), Three Kings Islands, Poor Knights, Islands&#xA0;many islands in the Hauraki Gulf, Alderman Islands, Mercury Islands, Bay of Plenty islands, Kapiti Island, Whenua Hou/Codfish Island, some of the muttonbird islands, and subantarctic Enderby and Adams Islands (Auckland Islands). Reintroduced to Tiritiri Matangi, Cuvier Island, Motuhora/Whale Island, Matiu/Somes Island, Motuihe Islands, Moturua Island (Bay of Islands), and Zealandia (Wellington), Tawharanui Regional Park and Shakespeare Regional Park.&#xA0;Red-crowned parakeets inhabit a variety of habitats, ranging from grass-covered islands (e.g. Macauley and Burgess Islands) to large heavily forested islands (e.g. Hauturu/ Little Barrier Island).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-crowned parakeets are locally common to abundant in suitable habitat. Large fluctuations in population size not uncommon, and are dependent on interannual environmental conditions particularly availability of food and (on some islands) water. Few population estimates are available. The population on 306 ha Macauley Island (Kermadec Islands) was estimated at 10,000 birds in November 1980, 17,000 to 20,000 birds in September 1988, fewer than 2,000 birds in November 1988, and 3,500 birds in July 2002.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">North Island and South Island mainland populations were eliminated through predation by introduced mammals (particularly rats, stoats and cats). Several island populations have been established or re-established by translocation of wild birds (e.g. Matiu/Somes, Motuihe and Tawharanui Peninsula) or captive-reared birds (e.g. Tiritiri Matangi, Cuvier &amp; Motuhora/Whale Islands). Red-crowned parakeets are commonly kept in captivity in New Zealand and overseas (particularly Australia). This species is known to hybridise with other <em>Cyanoramphus</em> species in the wild and in captivity. Genetic &#x2018;pollution&#x2019; of the captive stock has resulted in a ban on these birds being used for any further captive to wild translocations. Hybridisation between Chatham Island red-crowned parakeets (<em>C.n. chathamensis</em>) and Forbes&#x2019; parakeet (<em>C. forbesi</em>) on highly modified Mangere Island resulted in a hybrid swarm severely threatening the genetic integrity of endangered Forbes&#x2019; parakeets. Although common on many islands, red-crowned parakeets populations remain vulnerable to introduction (or reintroduction) of these pests and to introductions of parrot-specific diseases (e.g. Parrot Beak and Feather Disease). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-crowned parakeets have been recorded breeding year round, with the main breeding period subject to regional variations. They are cavity-nesters, preferring hollows in trees but also using holes in the ground, in cliff faces, talus slopes and under dense vegetation. The average clutch size for the nominate subspecies is 7 (range 4 to 9). Female parakeets are responsible for all nest preparation, incubation, brooding and feeding of chicks until 10-14 days of age, with all food provided to her by her mate. Thereafter, male and female parakeets feed chicks at the nest until fledging and independence. Egg-laying takes several days to complete, with incubation usually commencing after the second egg is laid. Incubation takes approximately 23 days, and the chicks hatch asynchronously, so there is a large variation in chick size within a brood. Nestling period varies widely depending on hatch order (nestling period 32-49 days). The last chicks to hatch usually fledge at an earlier age and are less developed than their older siblings. More than one brood may be attempted if the initial nest fails or if food supply allows.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-crowned parakeets have colonised and adapted to a range of environments and habitats on islands from the tropics to the subantarctic. Despite their rather erratic flight they are strong fliers and readily move within island groups searching for seasonal foods. When environmental conditions are good they are able to breed quickly, leading to rapid increases in population size. Red-crowned parakeets often forage for food on the ground or within low shrubby vegetation, making them vulnerable to ground-hunting predators.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-crowned parakeets are omnivorous, but eat mainly seeds, flowers and fruit from numerous plant species. Invertebrates, particularly scale insects, are eaten in spring before breeding. Kermadec red-crowned parakeets have been recorded scavenging marine molluscs on Macauley Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-crowned_Parakeet\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-crowned_Parakeet</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.terranature.org/parakeetred-crowned.htm\">http://www.terranature.org/parakeetred-crowned.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Greene, T.C. 1998.

They were once extremely common throughout New Zealand, but today are rare or uncommon in most places on the mainland, though they are still common on some predator-free islands and in a few valleys in eastern Fiordland and west Otago. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The genus <em>Cyanoramphus</em> to which the yellow-crowned parakeet belongs includes five other similar-sized green parrots in the New Zealand region and one each on Norfolk Island and New Caledonia. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The yellow-crowned parakeet is a small, forest-dwelling, long-tailed, predominantly green parrot with a yellow crown, a narrow crimson band between the crown and the cere, a red spot on each side of the rump and a blue leading edge to the outer wing. The bill is pale bluish-grey with a black tip and cutting edge; the legs and feet black-brown.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a characteristic chatter made by both sexes when flying, and a variety of quieter and less distinctive calls. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: very similar in appearance to the orange-fronted parakeet, but the yellow-crowned parakeet is brighter green, has a crimson (not orange) band above the cere, and red (not orange) spots on the flanks. Also similar to the red-crowned parakeet which is larger and has a red crown, and a red patch behind the eye.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yellow-crowned parakeets were previously found in forests throughout the main islands of New Zealand and on many offshore islands including the Auckland Islands. It is still present in most large native forests in the three main islands, though it is absent from Mt Egmont, north Taranaki and Northland. It occurs on Little Barrier, the Hen and Chickens, the Chetwodes Islands and Titi Island (outer Pelorus sound), Codfish Island, several smaller islands off Stewart Island and Fiordland and on the Auckland Islands. Yellow-crowned parakeets have been successfully introduced to Mana Island, and to Long Island and Motuara Island in Queen Charlotte Sound. On the mainland yellow-crowned parakeets are mostly confined to tall forests, but on islands they are also common in low scrub and even open grassland (Mana Island).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yellow-crowned parakeets are common on the offshore islands and in some mainland forests. In Eastern Fiordland and west Otago they become very abundant for a short period every time the beech trees seed heavily. They are rare on the Auckland Islands. The total population is probably in the tens of thousands. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yellow-crowned parakeets are preyed on by stoats, rats and possums, particularly while they are nesting and roosting in holes. During the rat and stoat plagues that occur in beech forests following beech mast, rates of predation can be very high and nesting success low. In many places they are conspicuously rare at low altitudes but more common higher up where rats and perhaps stoats are less common. Yellow-crowned parakeets are conspicuously more abundant on predator-free islands. They have been successfully translocated to three islands, and two mainland translocations are underway, to Maungatautari and Boundary Stream.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yellow-crowned parakeets are mostly summer breeders, but when food is abundant they can breed throughout the year and raise multiple broods. They nest in holes in trees &#x2013; mostly knot holes in large trees up to 32 m off the ground. The 2-9 eggs are laid on to rotten wood; the female alone incubates, but the male remains attentive, and feeds the female by regurgitation near the nest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yellow-crowned parakeets spend most of their time high in trees eating seeds, buds and invertebrates. They occasionally come down to the forest floor to eat seeds and to bathe. They are strong fliers and sometimes fly high above the canopy. When breeding, they associate in pairs but at other times they can form large flocks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Because they mostly forage high in trees they are most often detected by their calls, particularly their chatter. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Seeds, fruits, buds, flowers and invertebrates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=1477\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=1477</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://nzbirds.com/birds/kakarikiyellow.html\">http://nzbirds.com/birds/kakarikiyellow.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Elliott, G.P.; O&apos;Donnell, C.F.J.; Dilks, P.J. 1996.

A loud brief chatter or quieter contact call may give away its presence, but locating the bird can be extremely difficult. Orange-fronted parakeets are often confused with yellow-crowned parakeets. Formerly occurring throughout New Zealand, orange-fronted parakeets are now confined to&#xA0;four South Island beech forest valleys. Captive-reared birds have also been released on four offshore islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orange-fronted parakeets are small, green, long-tailed parakeets with a bluish tint to their plumage, and azure blue on their outer primaries and primary coverts. &#xA0;The crown is lemon yellow, and the frontal band above the eyes is orange, as are patches on either side of the rump. Colours tend to be brighter in males. Juveniles are duller, especially the frontal band and crown patch, which may be absent.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: most often a loud chatter call, of varying intensity and length. When a pair is together, softer contact calls are commonly heard, sometimes in addition to squeaks and churring. Calls made during courtship feeding and mating are quite distinctive, and comprised of single notes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: can be easily confused with the yellow-crowned parakeet, especially when juveniles are present. Yellow-crowned parakeets have a crimson frontal band and rump patches. A clear view of the frontal band or rump patch is required to accurately separate the two species. Identifying fledgling parakeets is particularly difficult, as their heads have very little coloration. The calls of the two species are very similar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orange-fronted parakeets are restricted to&#xA0;four beech (<em>Fuscospora</em> spp.) forest valleys in the South Island: the Hawdon, Andrews&#xA0;and Poulter valleys in Arthur&#x2019;s Pass National Park and the south branch of the Hurunui valley in Lake Sumner Forest Park. Their distribution within these valleys is very patchy, and the species is absent from most areas. They have been translocated to four islands: Maud Island and Blumine Island in the Marlborough Sounds, Chalky Island in Fiordland, and Tuhua (Mayor) Island in the Bay of Plenty.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orange-fronted parakeets occur almost exclusively in beech forests, although they are occasionally recorded in subalpine tussock and open, matagouri shrubland. They typically feed at the tops of tall trees, but can also be found amongst low vegetation, or on the ground. Dense, regenerating bush is also popular, especially with juveniles. All parts of the forest are used, including streams for drinking and bathing. If a beech mast has occurred, orange-fronted parakeets will usually be found consuming seeds high in the canopy.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This species is exceptionally difficult to count, largely because of its rarity, and cryptic and quiet nature, but also due to its similarity to the sympatric yellow-crowned parakeet. Numbers in the Hawdon, Andrews, and Poulter valleys are extremely low. The south branch of the Hurunui currently has the largest population on the mainland, being comprised almost entirely of birds that have been released from captivity. Even so, there are probably fewer than 100 mature parakeets on the mainland, and perhaps 200-300 on islands following translocations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main threat to orange-fronted parakeets is from introduced predators, especially ship rats and stoats, and particularly during irruption years following mast seeding events. Parakeet eggs and nestlings are also vulnerable to predation by possums, and fledglings are an easy target for cats. Habitat modification is also a threat, predominantly by deer and possums. The recent discovery of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) as far south as the Eglinton Valley (Fiordland), is also of concern. Competition with introduced species could be an issue as well, and common starlings are known to have taken over at least two hollows used by orange-fronted parakeets.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The three main actions taken to prevent the extinction of orange-fronted parakeet are: 1) control of rats, stoats, and possums in the valleys where orange-fronted parakeets occur; 2) protection of nests by fitting metal collars around the trunks of trees at nest sites; and, 3) rearing captive individuals at Isaac Conservation and Wildlife Trust for release on predator-free islands and intensively managed sites.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Research is underway to get a better understanding of the species&#x2019; ecology and breeding biology in the wild, and trials are being undertaken to determine the effectiveness of supplementary feeding. Testing of individual birds for PBFD is ongoing.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The conservation status of this species was returned to Nationally Critical in 2016, following a decline on the mainland after a beech mast in 2014/15, and a decrease in some of the island subpopulations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orange-fronted parakeets can breed in all months, but their main nesting period is between December and April, and incubation peaks in January. Mean clutch size is approximately 7, but a wide range has been recorded (from 1 to 10). Egg-laying is asynchronous, with an interval of 2 days between eggs. Incubation takes 21-26 days, and the nestling period lasts 35-45 days. Females appear to choose the nest site and undertake all preparation, incubation and brooding. The male provides most of the food, especially during incubation. However, females regularly leave the nest to feed briefly with the male. It is suspected that only the female feeds the nestlings for the first 10-14 days, as with other <em>Cyanoramphus</em> species. After this period, both adults feed the nestlings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Multiple clutches are not uncommon. If the first nesting attempt is unsuccessful, then the pair is likely to nest again once a suitable hollow is found. Some pairs may breed 3 or 4 times in succession when food is plentiful, such as during a beech seeding event. The female may lay another clutch when the first nestlings are approximately 2 weeks old. This leaves the male as the sole provider for both the nestlings and the incubating female. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nests are usually accessed through knot holes, most often in large branches or in the trunk of a tree. They predominantly nest in red beech (69% of monitored nests on the mainland, n=138) and standing dead trees (20%), but other beech species are also used. Nest bowls can be level with the entrance hollow, or over a metre deep. Recorded nest height varies between 2.5 and 26 metres.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orange-fronted parakeets were formerly (1800s) widespread across the South Island and several records exist for the North Island, Hen Island and Little Barrier Island during this period. Along with&#xA0;yellow-crowned and red-crowned parakeets, they were recorded in large numbers across the Canterbury Plains during the late 1800s. These irruptions were probably the result of a prolonged breeding season driven by heavy beech seeding.&#xA0;The birds were shot in vast numbers due to their feeding on domestic fruit orchards. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Extensive habitat modification to both alpine and lowland areas has impeded the species&#x2019; ability to search widely for food when their numbers are very high. As a result, their present habitat may be insufficient to allow numbers to return to former levels.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Orange-fronted parakeets consume seeds, flowers, buds and invertebrates (e.g. scale insects and caterpillars). In a mast year, seeds become the dominant item in the diet, and appear to be the principal food for nestlings. Invertebrates appear to play a larger part in the diet of this parakeet species than for yellow-crowned parakeets.

Although they appear very similar to the yellow-crowned parakeet of mainland New Zealand, crown colour is not a reliable indicator of&#xA0;taxonomic relationships. Forbes&#x2019; parakeets are believed to be descended from an ancient parakeet lineage that reached the Chatham Islands before the red-crowned/yellow-crowned split occurred on mainland New Zealand, after which red-crowned parakeets subsequently colonised the Chatham Islands also. Formerly found throughout the Chatham Islands, Forbes&#x2019; parakeets are now restricted to Mangere and Little Mangere Islands. Here, they are abundant, but were threatened through large-scale hybridisation with Chatham Island red-crowned parakeets. Hybrids currently comprise less than 10% of the Mangere Island parakeet population, and this proportion is closely monitored by the Department of Conservation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Forbes&#x2019; parakeets are medium-sized, long-tailed parrots with broad, rounded wings and predominantly emerald green plumage. They have a bright yellow fore-crown and a crimson frontal band that does not extend to the eye (cf. red-crowned parakeet). Males are larger than females. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: characteristic chatter, with variety of softer <em>tur-tur-tur</em> calls; similar to other <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeet species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Forbes&#x2019; parakeets have similar plumage to the smaller yellow-crowned parakeet, which does not occur on the Chatham Islands. Crown colouration is the only reliable diagnostic feature distinguishing Forbes&#x2019; parakeets (bright yellow) and Chatham Island red-crowned parakeets (red). Forbes&#x2019; parakeet is the predominant species on Mangere Island, with red-crowned parakeets comprising less than 5% of the population. Hybrid birds exhibit a continuum of crown colouration between the two species. Careful visual inspection of crown and head colouration is required to separate hybrid birds from Forbes&#x2019; parakeets, with assessment of whether the red frontal band extends to the eye (hybrid) or not (Forbes&#x2019;) considered a diagnostic character.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Forbes&#x2019; parakeets are presumed to have occurred throughout forested areas of Chatham Islands, but there is no recognised method to distinguish Forbes&#x2019; and red-crowned parakeet bones, which is needed to confirm their original distributions. By the time naturalists began visiting the Chatham Islands in the 1840s to 1890s, Forbes&#x2019; parakeets were confined to Pitt, Mangere and Little Mangere Islands. They disappeared from Pitt and Mangere Islands about 1890 following forest destruction and introduction of cats to both islands. Fortunately they survived on 10 ha Little Mangere Island, and recolonised the adjacent 131 ha Mangere Island after cats and sheep were eradicated from the larger island. They are currently restricted to densely vegetated areas of Mangere Island and Little Mangere Island although vagrants have appeared occasionally on Pitt and Chatham Islands. Improving habitat quality and quantity and the management of hybridisation have resulted in a significant population increase. Potential sites for translocation to Chatham Island are being considered.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Forbes&#x2019; parakeets are common on Mangere Island, where the parakeet population is estimated at 1,000 birds. Forbes&#x2019; parakeets comprise in excess of 90% of this total, with the remainder being Chatham Island red-crowned parakeets and hybrids. Forbes&#x2019; parakeets are also present on Little Mangere Island, with birds regularly commuting between the two islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Forbes&#x2019; parakeets were historically threatened by extensive habitat modification and predation by feral cats. They were reduced to extremely low numbers by the 1970s (&lt; 75 birds). More recently, Forbes&#x2019; parakeets have hybridised with Chatham Island red-crowned parakeets, jeopardising the genetic integrity of the species. Recent conservation initiatives such as extensive reforestation, provision of nest boxes and management of Chatham Island red-crowned parakeets and hybrids on Mangere Island has resulted in significant improvements in both habitat quality and parakeet numbers. Forbes&#x2019; parakeets are now common on most parts of Mangere Island, and there are&#xA0;plans for their introduction into pest-free habitats on Chatham Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Forbes&#x2019; parakeets have an extended breeding season, with eggs laid between October and March. They are cavity-nesters, preferring hollows in trees but also using rock crevices and under dense vegetation. The average clutch size is 5 eggs. Like all other <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeets, females are responsible for nest preparation, incubation, brooding and feeding of chicks until 10-14 days of age. During this period all her food is provided by her mate. Thereafter, male and female parakeets feed chicks at the nest until they fledge.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incubation usually commences after the second egg is laid, resulting in chicks within a brood varying greatly in age and size. The last chicks to hatch out usually fledge at an earlier age and are less developed than their older siblings. More than one brood may be attempted if the initial nest fails or if food supply allows.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Forbes&#x2019; parakeets occur at higher densities in forest and in areas of dense regenerating vegetation than in open grassland. Despite their rather erratic flight they are strong fliers and readily move between Mangere and Little Mangere Islands. Individual Forbes&#x2019; parakeets have occasionally been observed in the southern forests of Chatham Island (&gt;20 km from Mangere Island) and on nearby Pitt and Rangatira Islands. Their social behaviour is similar to other species of <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeets. They are strongly territorial around nests, calling loudly and chasing intruders from vicinity.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Food items consumed by Forbes&#x2019; parakeets are affected by seasonal availability, and include seeds, flowers and leaves from a variety of plants, with invertebrates more important in spring. They forage extensively on the ground in more open areas.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Aikman, H.; Miskelly, C. 2004. <em>Birds of the Chatham Islands</em>.

It was named by the artist, illustrator and poet Edward Lear (1812-1888), who is now most well-known for his nonsense poems, including <em>The Owl and the Pussycat</em>. Lear&#x2019;s first publication, at the age of 19, was <em>Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots. </em>This compendium of 42 lithographic plates of parrots, bound together as a limited edition book, was destined to become one of the most sought after (i.e. expensive) of all early bird books. In this volume, Lear illustrated and named a mysterious green parrot that was held at the London Zoo. No-one knew where the bird had come from, and it was another 55 years before Captain Fairchild of the New Zealand government steamer <em>Stella</em> solved the riddle, discovering that Lear&#x2019;s &#x2018;<em>Platycercus unicolor</em> Uniform Parrakeet&#x2019; came from the speck of land that is as far from London Zoo as it is possible to get &#x2013; Antipodes Island!</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Antipodes Island parakeet is an unmistakable, uniformly green parakeet endemic to the subantarctic Antipodes Islands. It is much larger than the Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets with which it shares this isolated island group. Leaves dominate its diet, but the species is noted for its habit of scavenging bird carcasses and broken eggs, and for killing and eating grey-backed storm petrels - joining the kea as New Zealand&#x2019;s second occasionally predatory parrot.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The largest and most robust of all the <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeets, the Antipodes Island parakeet has uniformly green plumage that lacks the crown colouration typical of the rest of the genus. It has a very large bill and broad, rounded wings. Males are larger than females. Although capable of strong direct flight, Antipodes Island parakeets prefer to fly only short distances. They are inquisitive and often attracted to human activity.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: the characteristic rapid <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeet chatter is distinctly deeper and louder <em>kok-kok-kok-kok-kok. </em>Also a variety of softer chatter calls.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: easily distinguished from the much smaller Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets with which it shares its range. Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets have a red crown and eye-stripe, and are much more likely to take flight when disturbed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Common throughout Antipodes Island, less frequent on smaller satellite islands, particularly in areas of tall dense tussocks and sedges, and where these occur on slopes and along streams.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antipodes Island parakeets are common on Antipodes Island and Bollons Island, with smaller numbers on Archway, Windward and Leeward Islands. Total population is estimated between 1000 and 2000 birds. This increased variability (compared to previous estimates) has come about through monitoring resulting from recent survey effort for non-target impacts of mouse eradication. They are less common than the co-occurring Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Antipodes Island parakeet has a stable population and is common within its 2,000 ha range. The population is protected by the islands&#x2019; isolated location and status as a strict Nature Reserve, which limits human visits. There is no evidence for hybridisation with the smaller Reischek&#x2019;s parakeet in the wild. They were thought to compete with introduced house mice for seeds, but mice on Antipodes Island were subject to an eradication programme in the winter of 2016. The biggest threat to long-term survival is the possible arrival of mammalian predators.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antipodes Island parakeets were introduced to Kapiti Island (1907) and Stephens Island (1986). They had died out on Kapiti Island by 1923, and were removed from Stephens Island in 1989. There is a small and declining captive population in New Zealand. These captive birds have been known to hybridise with captive Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antipodes Island parakeets nest from October to March, using burrows up to one metre deep in fibrous peat or in tunnels (0.6 m long) within the dense matted bases of clumps of tall tussocks or ferns. The single nest found in the wild contained 5 eggs. Nest material was comprised of fern-scales and rootlets removed from the walls of the chamber. In captivity, the average clutch size is 5.6 eggs. Like all other <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeets, females are largely responsible for nest preparation, incubation, brooding and feeding of chicks until they are 10-14 days of age. During this period all her food is provided by her mate, who is much more assertive than other male <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeets. Prior to the chicks fledging, male birds take over most of the chick feeding, and are fed by their mates. Both parents feed fledglings until they are independent (a minimum of two weeks after fledging).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although common, Antipodes Island parakeets are generally less abundant than Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets in most habitats. They are sedentary, quiet and usually seen singly or as pairs or in small family groups. Significant differences in diet between the two parakeet species have been observed. Strong seasonal and annual dietary differences related to food availability are also apparent. Distinctive piles of chewed and crushed tussock and sedge leaves are readily observed in areas where these parakeets have been feeding.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This species is one of the few parrot species known to scavenge flesh from the carcasses of seabirds and furseals,&#xA0;and broken eggs. They are also actively hunt and prey on nesting grey-backed storm petrels. This behaviour occurs immediately before the parakeet&#x2019;s breeding season, and is thought to be a seasonally reliable additional source of protein.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antipodes Island parakeets are strong fliers but prefer to walk about and climb over vegetation, especially when feeding. If disturbed these parakeets become extremely furtive (particularly male birds) and will quickly disappear into the surrounding vegetation. Extensive use is made of the available labyrinth of seabird tunnels and runways and they often reappear some distance away in unexpected directions. Like all <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeets, they like to bathe regularly and spend significant periods sitting and preening in warm sheltered sites. Few territorial disputes are seen.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antipodes Island parakeets display strong seasonal and interannual dietary preferences for leaves and seeds (especially those from <em>Poa litorosa</em> and <em>Carex appressa</em>) supplemented seasonally with flowers, seeds, berries, carrion and flesh from grey-backed storm petrels. Invertebrates are a minor component of the diet. The birds forage extensively on the ground, and are commonly seen foraging in the open over abandoned erect-crested penguin colonies during winter months.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://terranature.org/parakeetantipodes.htm\">http://terranature.org/parakeetantipodes.htm</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/antipodesparakeet.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/antipodesparakeet.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Elliott, G.P.; Greene, T.C.; Nathan, H.W.; Russell, J.C. 2015. <strong>&#xA0;</strong>Winter bait uptake trials and related field work on Antipodes Island in preparation for mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>) eradication.

It is a medium-sized, brightly coloured, green parrot with a red crown, that looks very similar to other &#x2018;red-crowned&#x2019; parakeets (e.g. <em>C. novaezelandiae</em>). But appearances can be deceiving. Genetic studies reveal that crown colour may not be a good indicator of parakeet taxonomy, and that the diminutive orange-fronted parakeet may be the closest relative of Reischek&#x2019;s parakeet. It is common throughout the Antipodes Islands, particularly in more open areas and coastal fringes close to penguin colonies.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets are medium-sized, long-tailed parrots with broad, rounded wings and predominantly emerald green plumage, with a bright red fore-crown.

They are common throughout, but particularly so in areas of low vegetation in more open areas around the North Plains and the coastal fringe. In winter, large numbers of Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets are seen within abandoned erect-crested penguin breeding colonies. They are capable of strong flight, and flock to seasonally available foods.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets are common on Antipodes Island and Bollons Island, with smaller numbers on Archway, Windward and Leeward Islands. The total population is thought to be approximately 4,000-6,000 birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets apparently have a stable population, and are common within their 2,000 ha range. They are protected by the islands&#x2019; isolated location and their status as a strict Nature Reserve. The biggest threat to Reischek&#x2019;s parakeet&#x2019;s long-term survival is the arrival of mammalian predators. An attempt to eradicate mice from Antipodes Island was made in winter of 2016. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Relatively little is known about breeding for Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets. They appear to nest from October to March within tunnels modified or constructed within the bases of clumps of tussocks or ferns. Clutch size in the wild is unknown. It is likely that their breeding ecology and behavior are similar to those of other <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeets.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets are more abundant than Antipodes Island parakeets in most habitats. Significant differences in diet between the two parakeet species have been observed. Strong seasonal and annual dietary differences related to food availability are also apparent. Reischek&#x2019;s parakeets are strong fliers and have been observed flying between islands within the Antipodes group. Social behaviour is similar to other species of <em>Cyanoramphus</em> parakeets, but they have been noted spending considerable periods basking and preening in sheltered areas.

They breed on islands off southern Australia, mainly in Bass Strait and around Tasmania. Short-tailed shearwaters migrate annually, travelling further north than the related sooty shearwater, from the Aleutian Islands through Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean. They return across the central Pacific, some migrating south along the west coast of North America. Birds fly around 15,000 km each way, a journey that takes six weeks in both directions. Short-tailed shearwaters are often seen at sea off mainland New Zealand from October to January and in May. Here, they are often mistaken for sooty shearwaters, which are slightly larger, with paler underwings.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The short-tailed shearwater is brown-black all over with dull grey underwings. It has long, pointed wings and a short, rounded tail. The lead-grey bill is relatively short for a shearwater (32 x 11 mm), and the legs and feet are dark grey. Short-tailed shearwaters have a compact physique, with a small head with a domed forehead, a short neck and a deep body (cf. the slimmer, more elongated wedge-tailed shearwater). The sexes are alike.</p>\n<p>Voice: throaty <em>kooka-rooka-rah</em> calls are repeated rapidly, usually from the ground or in the burrow. These change to <em>koo-roo-rah </em>as the rate of calling increases and the pitch rises in energetic repetition. Short-tailed shearwaters are usually silent in flight.</p>\n<p>Similar species: sooty shearwater is similar but slightly larger (44 cm) and heavier (800 g) and with a longer wingspan, longer bill (42 x 13 mm), a larger head with a flatter crown, and (usually) a silver-grey flash on the underwings. Dark morph wedge-tailed shearwater is longer (46 cm) but lighter (450 g), with a longer bill (38 x 13 mm), longer wedge-shaped tail, and pale flesh-coloured legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Short-tailed shearwaters breed only in Australia with most of the population in the south-east on islands in Bass Strait and around Tasmania. They breed in 285 colonies from September to April with 18 million birds arriving in Tasmania each year. There are 167 colonies in Tasmania, with the largest colony on Babel Island (3 million burrows). Colonies are usually on headlands and islands covered with tussocks and iceplant. During breeding, birds alternate between short foraging trips to local waters and long foraging trips of up to 17 days to the Polar Front (= Antarctic Convergence), where cold Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the subantarctic, halfway between Tasmania and Antarctica.</p>\n<p>Short-tailed shearwaters migrate annually, north to the Arctic region, with some passing through Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean. Birds return across the central Pacific, some migrating south along the west coast of North America. Birds fly around 15,000 km each way, a journey that takes six weeks in each direction. They are often seen at sea off mainland New Zealand from October to January and in May. Stragglers have also reached the Kermadec, Chatham, Snares, and Campbell Islands in the New Zealand region, and nearby Macquarie Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The estimated total population of short-tailed shearwater is 23 million birds. Although the population trend is increasing in North America, the global population is suspected to be in decline due to ecosystem changes resulting from climate change. Early accounts from Australia suggest they were far more numerous in the eighteenth century with at least 100 million birds estimated by Matthew Flinders within a single flock in Bass Strait in 1798.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Although their population is massive, short-tailed shearwaters are still vulnerable to over-harvesting, habitat destruction and reductions in food availability. Feral pigs, cattle and sheep have destroyed whole colonies at some locations. Feral cats also find shearwater chicks easy prey. Soil erosion after fire can destroy suitable sites for burrowing. North Pacific commercial fisheries catch and drown up to 50,000 birds annually. About 200,000 chicks are harvested annually in Tasmania by commercial operators. At sea, short-tailed shearwaters sometimes eat&#xA0;plastic debris,&#xA0;mistaking it for food, which may contribute to deaths during migration. On average, short-tailed shearwaters live 15-19 years, with some as&#xA0;long as 38 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Short-tailed shearwater breeds in dense colonies mainly in areas of tussocks or iceplant, or on cliffs or bare ground. Birds arrive at the colonies in September-October, meet their mate, and prepare their burrow. Mating takes place inside the 1 m long burrow. Adult birds generally remain with the same mate for life, although around 25% of pairings break up after failing to produce young. In early November the pair leave the colony to feed at sea before returning in late November when the female lays a single large (71 x 47 mm) white egg. Egg-laying peaks 27-28 November. Incubation is shared and takes about 53 days. Eggs hatch in the third week of January; both parents feed the chick, which quickly puts on weight until it is nearly twice the weight of an adult. Adults depart from early April, leaving the young bird, which rapidly loses weight and acquires flight feathers. Two to three weeks after the parents leave, the juvenile birds start migration unassisted by the parents. The age at first breeding is about 5 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Short-tailed shearwaters are often seen in large rafts at sea off Tasmania during the breeding season. They feed in flocks of up to 20,000 birds, sometimes with other seabirds or with dolphins when around schooling fish. Colonies are visited after dark, and birds depart before dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Short-tailed shearwaters take fish and other prey by plunging into the water and pursuing it underwater, up to 10 metres below the surface. They also seize prey at the surface and hydroplane, holding their&#xA0;head in the water while flying low over the surface, grabbing any prey within reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=5100\">http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=5100</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3934\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3934</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-tailed_Shearwater\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-tailed_Shearwater</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Baduini, C.L.; Hyrenback, C.L.; Coyle, K.O.; Pinchuk, A.; Mendenhal, V.; Hunt Jnr, G.L. 2001.

Only two vagrants have been identified in New Zealand. The common name and the scientific name <em>nativitatis</em> reflect the species being named after a specimen from Christmas Island, now known as Kiritimati, in the Line Islands group.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Christmas Island shearwater is an all-dark, medium-sized petrel, with blackish plumage and a dark under wing. It has a slightly wedge-shaped tail, a long thin black bill and dark feet. The Christmas Island shearwater has buoyant flight but it usually flies close to the sea surface with stiff wing-flapping and little soaring.</p>\n<p>Voice: Christmas Island shearwater are silent at sea, and give plaintive sighs, whines and moans at the colony.</p>\n<p>Similar species: several other all-dark (or nearly all-dark) petrels occur in New Zealand. The long thin bill of Christmas Island shearwater identifies it as&#xA0;belonging to the genus&#xA0;<em>Puffinus</em>, of which sooty shearwater, short-tailed shearwater and wedge-tailed shearwater share a dark bill. Christmas Island shearwaters are smaller than all these species and have completely dark feet. Also their relatively longer tail and entirely dark under wing distinguish them from sooty shearwaters and most short-tailed shearwaters, although even in Christmas Island shearwaters the under wing can appear silvery. Other all-dark petrels with&#xA0;dark, but more robust, bills include Kerguelen petrel (350 g), grey-faced petrel&#xA0;(550 g) and the very rare Bulwer&#x2019;s petrel&#xA0;(94 g).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>All Christmas Island shearwater nesting colonies are on islands in the tropical and subtropical Pacific: Marshall, Johnston, Hawaiian, Phoenix, Line, Marquesas, Tuamotu, Samoan (possibly), Austral, Gambier, Oeno, Henderson, Ducie, Easter Islands and Isla Salas y Gomez. The Christmas Island shearwater is not known to migrate but its at-sea distribution is poorly understood .</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are only two New Zealand records of Christmas Island shearwater. The first was a &quot;well-dried corpse&quot; found on Dargaville Beach in February 1976. The second was caught alive among wedge-tailed shearwaters on Curtis Island, in the Kermadec group, in November 1989. New Zealand is more than 2,000 km from the nearest breeding site, so these two birds were probably strays. There are no records of Christmas Island shearwater from Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Christmas Island shearwaters are usually nocturnal ashore but can be active at colonies at all times of the day. Nests are usually in cavities or burrows in rocky areas or under vegetation. Breeding may occur year-round but some populations nest synchronously or in distinct seasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The Christmas Island shearwater feeds by pursuit diving and plunging. Food is mainly squid with lesser amounts of fish. The bird caught on Curtis Island regurgitated the remains of 3-5 cm long fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Shearwater\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Shearwater</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3935\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3935</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. 2004. <em>Albatrosses and petrels across the world</em>.

The nominate subspecies is an Hawaiian Islands endemic, with most of the estimated 18-19,000 breeding pairs on Kaua&#x2019;i. Outside the May-October breeding season it is highly pelagic, ranging generally in the seas around the Hawaiian Islands. The much rare Rapa shearwater breeds on four islets off Rapa Island, eastern Polynesia. Newell&#x2019;s shearwater is a rare vagrant to New Zealand (one record) and Norfolk Island (a live bird on Philip Island, December 1997, and one offshore in February 2010); it is not known whether these birds were of the Hawaiian or Rapa form.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Newell&#x2019;s is a typical black-and-white <em>Puffinus </em>shearwater, with the characteristic rapid wingbeat and glide flight pattern of the smaller members of the genus. It is cleanly black-and-white, with very dark upper surfaces and prominent white flank &#x2019;tabs&#x2019;, i.e. extensions of the white flanks to form white sides to the rump. The dark cap extends to below the eye, and there is a sharply defined broad wedge of white extending from the neck, with the point near the ear. The underwing is also cleanly black-and-white, with broad black margins The undertail coverts are dark. The bill and eye are black, and the legs are pink with dark toes.</p>\n<p>Similar species: fluttering shearwater also has white flank &#x2019;tabs&#x2019; (though not as pronounced) but is much browner and does not have a sharply defined white wedge behind the eye. Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater is darker underneath (especially on the throat and underwings) and lacks the crisp white facial wedge and flank tabs. Manx shearwater is a very rare vagrant to New Zealand (3 records); it has white undertail coverts, and the underwing margins are not as bold and dark as in Newell&#x2019;s shearwater.</p>\n<p>Little shearwater is smaller with a white face to above the eye. Both little shearwater and the equally small subantarctic little shearwater have much whiter underwings, with narrow dark margins.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The nominate form of Newell&#x2019;s Shearwater breeds only on the south-east Hawaiian Islands, in recent years mostly on Kauai. It is highly pelagic during the non-breeding season, ranging widely in the Hawaiian Islands region. They occasionally occur as far as the south-west Pacific, with records (not all confirmed) from Fiji, Norfolk Island and offshore from Sydney.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records </strong></p>\n<p>The sole New Zealand record is of a beach-wrecked bird found near Dargaville in November 1994. The specimen is held in Te Papa (registration no. OR.025004).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>The US Fish and Wildlife Service first listed Newell&#x2019;s shearwater as a &#x201C;Threatened Species&#x201D; in 1975. Introduced mammalian predators are the key threats to Newell&#x2019;s shearwater. Fledging birds are often attracted to city lights and are downed in significant numbers. The Hawaiian public is well-educated about this and many birds are saved.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Newell&#x2019;s shearwater is a colonial nester, laying a single egg in June in a burrow. Burrows are located on steep ridges among tangled native vegetation, on Kaua&#x2019;i generally between 150 and 800 m. Most fledging occurs in October and November.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Newell&#x2019;s shearwaters leave their nesting sites in the early morning, and returning at dusk. At sea they are pelagic, generally feeding far offshore.

The population undergoes a trans-equatorial migration into the South Atlantic during the non-breeding season. Only three vagrants have been identified in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The species&apos; scientific name comes from the English word &quot;puffin&quot; which apparently referred to cured carcasses of nestling shearwaters - due to confusion this name was later adopted for the Atlantic puffin (<em>Fratercula arctica</em>) - both are burrowing species that often nest together. The name &quot;Manx&quot; came from the Isle of Man, where a large colony once occurred on the Calf of Man Island.</p>\n<p>Previously the Manx shearwater was considered to have many subspecies breeding around the world, including New Zealand&apos;s Hutton&apos;s and fluttering shearwaters, but now these are all considered to be species in their own right.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Manx shearwater is a medium-sized black-and-white petrel with a short tail. Close up, the plumage is brown-black dorsally and white ventrally, with a crescent-shaped white patch behind the ear-coverts and a dark thigh patch. The long thin bill is dark grey and the feet are mainly pink with outer portions black. The Manx shearwater often flies just above the water&apos;s surface. Its flight consists of short soaring gliding and banking interspersed with rapid flapping of stiffly held wings, but it soars more in higher winds. At a distance the species appears dark above and white below.</p>\n<p>Voice: Manx shearwaters are normally silent at sea but noisy when ashore at their colonies.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Manx shearwaters can only be separated from fluttering and Hutton&apos;s shearwaters with great care. Manx shearwaters are slightly larger than both New Zealand species and have a more sharply defined head pattern. Manx and Hutton&apos;s shearwaters have dark outer webs to their otherwise white under tail covert feathers, whereas in fluttering shearwaters these coverts are all white. Also Manx shearwaters generally have whiter axillary feathers than both New Zealand species. Overall, Hutton&apos;s shearwaters are the darkest of these three species ventrally, with a duskier under wing and throat. Newell&#x2019;s shearwater (with one record from New Zealand) is very similar to Manx shearwater, but with darker margins to the underwings, and much darker undertail coverts.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Most Manx shearwater nesting colonies are on islands in the north-east Atlantic, particularly around Ireland and Britain, with small numbers at sites along north-east North America. Migrating birds are mainly found in South Atlantic seas off Brazil and Argentina, where the species is common from November to January, but the species regularly reaches southern Africa. The species has been recorded in the eastern Pacific with increasing frequency but only straggles to Australasia.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>There are only three New Zealand records, all immatures beach-washed on lower North Island west coast beaches: Pukerua Bay (June 1972), Waikanae Beach (January 1985), and Otaki Beach (July 2002). The occurrence of these birds in New Zealand may be partly explained by the fact that immatures often remain in the South Atlantic during the northern summer. It is speculated that Manx shearwaters reaching Australasia have been swept across the South Indian Ocean by the prevailing westerly winds.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Manx shearwaters lay a single white egg per season, in late April to early May, with chicks fledging mainly in September. They breed in colonies, nesting in burrows and under rocks where adults share incubation and chick-rearing duties. Manx shearwaters are active ashore only at night to avoid predators. They are long-lived, with one bird reaching at least 55 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Manx shearwaters feed, either individually or in flocks, mainly on fish and marine invertebrates. They feed on the surface or dive for food.

It is often seen in flocks, sometimes numbering thousands of birds, moving rapidly while foraging. Fluttering shearwaters feeds in association with schools of fish (e.g. kahawai, trevally) or in massive groups at the surface on crustaceans; and at times, resting in large, dense rafts. During the post-breeding period, a considerable proportion of the population remain within&#xA0;local waters, where fluttering shearwaters are a common sight inshore throughout winter months. They have been observed visiting colonies during the non-breeding period. However, they are also&#xA0;trans-Tasman migrants and are recorded in considerable numbers in eastern and south-eastern Australian waters from February to August. These birds may all be pre-breeders, and have included band recoveries of recently-fledged chicks.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The fluttering shearwater is a small dark-brown-and-white shearwater. A dark cap extends below the eye in a smudgy line to a partial collar, giving the head a dusky appearance. The upper-surfaces are uniformly dark grey-brown, including neck, wings and tail. Distinctive white patches (&#x2018;saddle bags&#x2019;) extend up from the white flanks, behind the wings to form white sides to the rump. White extends from the chin to the under-tail, apart from a dark thigh patch. The under-wings have a dusky appearance with variable dark markings on the inner-wing, although in strong low light can appear white. The appearance can vary markedly with light conditions. The bill is long, thin, and dark; the legs and feet are pinkish-brown with dark webs. The feet extend beyond the tail in flight. They moult from late January, appearing ragged, with the dark upper surfaces faded to mid-brown. Their flight is best described as &#x2018;determined&#x2019;, i.e. low and fast, with bursts of rapid wing-beating (fluttering) interspersed with short glides.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice: a distinctive, staccato <em>ka-hek-ka-hek-ka-hek</em>, mostly made in flight, over and around colonies, however very occasionally heard calling at sea amongst feeding flocks.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater is a very similar-looking, but larger bird. Confusion with Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater is most likely in central New Zealand around Cook Strait where both species overlap during breeding; Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater is a rare visitor to northern New Zealand waters and mostly likely before or after breeding. Its head is darker, with little white showing on the chin and throat; the under-wing pattern is also darker. In the hand, Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater has a longer, slimmer bill, and dark outer vanes to the undertail coverts (these are white in fluttering shearwaters). Little shearwater occurs with fluttering shearwater in northern New Zealand waters. Little shearwater is smaller and has white extending above the eye. Combined with the shorter bill and white underwings, it has a &#x2018;cleaner&#x2019;, sharper appearance than fluttering shearwater. Subantarctic little shearwater (southern New Zealand) is smaller, darker above and whiter below (especially underwings). Manx shearwater and Newell&#x2019;s shearwater are both very rare vagrants to New Zealand; both are bolder black-and-white than fluttering shearwater, with a triangle of white reaching up to the ear, more prominent white &#x2018;saddle-bags&#x2019; and cleaner white underwing with broad dark trailing edge (the two differ from each other in mainly in the colour of their undertail).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fluttering shearwaters breed on many offshore islands throughout northern New Zealand, with large colonies on Three Kings, Moturoa, Motuharakeke (Cavalli), Bream, north-west Chickens, Mercury and Alderman Islands. In the Marlborough Sounds there are large colonies on Trio and Long Islands. There are smaller but significant populations on Mokohinau Islands, Hen (Taranga) Island, Poor Knights Islands and Stephens Island. Fluttering shearwaters are naturally recolonising Little Barrier Island (Hauturu) following rat eradication. In restoration projects, chicks have successfully been translocated to Maud Island (Marlborough Sounds) and Mana Island (Wellington). Adults have also been attracted to playback systems installed at Young Nicks Head (Poverty Bay), Matiu/Somes Island (Wellington Harbour) and Tawharanui Open Sanctuary (Hauraki Gulf).</p>\n<p><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Fluttering shearwaters are abundant. A 1980s estimate was between 100,000 and 1 million birds; numbers are likely to be closer to the lower end of that range. Flocks of up to 20,000 birds have been recorded.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>All fluttering shearwaters breeding colonies are on mammal-free islands, or islands where only Pacific rat (kiore) is present. Reinvasion of islands by mammalian predators is a major threat. Their relatively shallow nesting burrows are often in friable soils, and are easily collapsed by people moving through areas where they breed; access should be strictly limited. Fluttering shearwaters are not generally attracted to fishing vessels. However, because they feed by diving, commonly in flocks, they can be caught in set nets, at times in large numbers (e.g. 166+ in a single incident at Whangaparaoa Peninsula, in May 2009). Over-harvesting of schooling fish (e.g. kahawai, trevally, mackerel), principally through purse-seine fishing, could have a serious impact on fluttering shearwaters and other species that feed in association with these schools.&#xA0;Oil spills are also a risk; at least 240 fluttering shearwaters were killed by oil following the stranding of the container ship <em>Rena</em> in the Bay of Plenty in October 2011.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Fluttering shearwaters nest in short burrows, under scrub or in forest; colonies can be extremely dense where populations are large; in places co-exist with other species (e.g. common diving petrel, grey-faced petrel). The single large (57 x 40 mm) white egg is laid from late September through to late October. Incubation and chick-care is shared, but there are no data on incubation length or nestling period. Chicks fledge in January (northern New Zealand) to February (Cook Strait)</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The fluttering shearwater is a surprisingly poorly-known species. They return to breed when 4-10 years old, and are usually faithful to mates and breeding burrows between years. Results of recent research using geolocators to investigate seasonal movements of birds breeding on the Mokohinau Islands has yet to be published.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Fluttering shearwaters eat small fish (e.g. pilchards, sprats) and crustacea (e.g. the small euphausiid <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em>). Fish are caught by pursuit diving, using partially-folded wings for propulsion. Pelagic crustaceans are caught while moving forward, head often submerged to look underwater, sometimes with wings raised, and partially spread. Foraging fluttering shearwaters are a spectacular sight when feeding in fast-moving flocks in pursuit of fish schools. There is frenetic activity, with many birds splashing into the water and disappearing below the surface to emerge and repeat the action.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3941\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3941</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brooke, M. de L. 2004. <em>Albatrosses and petrels of the world. </em>Oxford, Oxford University Press.</p>\n<p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

The holotype (NMNZ S028002, partial skeleton) and paratypes (a series of bones from the type locality, the most important of which are NMNZ S27964 and NMNZ S27958) are held at the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa. The type locality is Te Ana Titi Cave, Fox River. The age of the bones ranges from the last glacial maximum (Otiran, late Pleistocene) to post-Polynesian settlement (late Holocene).</p>\n<p>The specific name refers to the occurrence of this species in cave deposits. The common name honours Ron Scarlett (1911-2002), the New Zealand palaeontologist who first recognised the distinctness of the fossil material later attributed to this species.</p>\n<p>Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwater is a typical shearwater of the Manx/fluttering shearwater group. DNA analysis shows that it forms a strongly supported monophyletic clade with two extant endemic New Zealand shearwater species, the fluttering shearwater (<em>Puffinus gavia</em>) and Hutton&apos;s shearwater (<em>P. huttoni</em>). &#xA0;It is believed that these species diversified in the Pleistocene. Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwater&#xA0;was smaller than its presumed closest relatives, and weighed about 250 g. The wing proportions of Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwater are very similar to those of the fluttering shearwater and unlike the longer-winged Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater, which indicates that Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwater was relatively sedentary (like the fluttering shearwater and unlike the migratory Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater). The three species bred allopatrically, with Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwater favouring wetter forests and highland regions as well as coastal sites within northwest Nelson and Buller, fluttering shearwaters on islands and headlands in the Marlborough Sounds, and Hutton&#x2019;s shearwaters in the Kaikoura ranges and North Canterbury hill country. Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwaters clearly bred at or near the type locality, possibly on cliff ledges lining the Fox River adjacent to the Te Ana Titi Cave, because almost 10% of bones in the deposit are from chicks.</p>\n<p>Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwater probably fed on small fish and crustaceans in the adjacent Tasman Sea throughout the year. They became extinct shortly after human settlement; breeding colonies may have been over-exploited directly, and the small size of Scarlett&#x2019;s shearwaters would have made eggs and chicks vulnerable to predation by the introduced Pacific rat (kiore). Before human settlement, there would have been many petrels breeding on the mainland of both islands, providing a major transfer of nutrients from the surrounding seas to the land. This ecologically important nutrient flow was interrupted as mainland colonies became extinct under the pressure of human hunting and the impacts of introduced mammalian predators. The long term effects of this cessation of nutrient flow on vegetation growth and patterning is unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Holdaway, R.N.; Worthy, T.H. 1994.

The two colonies are restricted to the alpine zone of the Seaward Kaikoura mountains behind Kaikoura. These are the last remnants of many colonies that formerly existed in both the Seaward Kaikoura and Inland Kaikoura Ranges, ten of which survived through until the 1960s. The loss of colonies is largely attributed to them being accessible to feral pigs. Whilst the number of colonies has diminished with the impact of predators, there is no evidence that the species ever bred beyond these mountains. The colonies were known to Maori who harvested the young birds for food, but it was not until 1965 that the locations of the two&#xA0;extant colonies were re-discovered by Geoff Harrow.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since 1990, research has provided good information on the breeding biology of Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater and the threats they face at these colonies. Information is also available on their distribution at sea both during and outside of the breeding season. A new colony has been established behind a predator-proof fence on Kaikoura Peninsula and is now managed by a community-based charitable trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater is a medium-sized brown-and-white shearwater. It has dark-brown upperparts extending to the head. A broad dark mottled collar extends down from the neck, contrasting with the remaining white underparts. The off-white underwings merge into dark borders particularly at the wing tips and with distinctly dusky &#x2018;armpits&#x2019;. The bill is long, slender and dark grey. The eye is dark, and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown with dark webs. The feet extend beyond the tail in flight.</p>\n<p>Voice: Hutton&#x2019;s shearwaters are generally silent at sea, but are noisy on and over their colonies, with loud cackling calls similar to those of fluttering shearwater.</p>\n<p>Similar species: fluttering shearwater is a very similar-looking, but slightly smaller bird which breeds in the Marlborough Sounds and further north, and has a range that completely overlaps the New Zealand range of Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater. The fluttering shearwater is paler, with more white showing on the chin and throat, and a whiter underwing, lacking the dark &#x2018;armpits&#x2019; of Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater. In the hand, fluttering shearwater has a shorter, stouter bill, and white outer vanes to the undertail coverts (these are dark in Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater). Subantarctic little shearwater (southern New Zealand) is smaller, darker above and whiter below (especially the underwings). Manx shearwater and Newell&#x2019;s shearwater are both very rare vagrants to New Zealand; both are bolder black-and-white than Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater, with a triangle of white reaching up to the ear, more prominent white sides to the rump, and a cleaner white underwing with broad dark trailing edge (the two differ from each other&#xA0;mainly in the colour of their undertail).&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>From September through to March, Hutton&#x2019;s shearwaters are present over the inshore waters off Kaikoura. They congregate in large flocks before the evening flight into the breeding colonies. The largest colony is in the head of Kowhai Stream within a nature reserve; a smaller colony is on private land at the head of Shearwater Stream. All nesting is on steep tussock-covered slopes at sites above 1200 m altitude. The at-sea distribution of Hutton&#x2019;s shearwaters within New Zealand waters is poorly understood as few observers attempt to distinguish Hutton&#x2019;s and fluttering shearwaters at sea. There are sightings and beach-wrecked birds from Northland to Foveaux Strait, including East Cape and Westland, though it is apparent that the bulk of the population stays between Cape Campbell and Banks Peninsula, off the north-east coast of the South Island, when breeding. Outside the breeding season Hutton&#x2019;s shearwaters are migratory and most are absent from New Zealand waters. Adult birds have been fitted with geo-locators which revealed details of their winter migration to Australia, with some birds completing an anti-clockwise circuit of the continent. Young birds stay in Australian waters for 4-5 years before returning to visit breeding colonies.</p>\n<p><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>There is an estimated breeding population of more than 100,000 pairs of Hutton&#x2019;s shearwaters, with a similar number of non-breeding birds that visit the colony early in the season. Despite this relatively high number the species is regarded as endangered because of their past decline (evident from extinct colonies) and the threats they still face.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Stoats prey on young Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater chicks, and kea also excavate burrows and kill chicks. Studies have shown that the Kowhai Stream colony is too large to be adversely affected by stoat predation. Stoat control&#xA0;is undertaken&#xA0;at the smaller colony in Shearwater Stream, which is likely to be more vulnerable. The greater threat is from predation by wild pigs or trampling of the colonies by ungulates. All the colonies which have gone extinct in the last century have been destroyed by pigs. Studies of breeding success have shown big changes between years, presumably due to fluctuations in the availability of food at sea. Adult birds are occasionally killed in nets set for fish along the Kaikoura coast. As young birds fledge in autumn, some always fail to make the flight to sea, with storms or their attraction to street lighting cause them to crash near the township. Many, but not all, of these birds are rescued and released at sea.</p>\n<p>The earthquakes of November 2016 caused considerable damage to the mountain colonies. Post-earthquake photographs show that 10-15% of the colonies&#xA0;were destroyed by&#xA0;landslides, and examination of 100 individual burrows at a site not affected by landslides showed that 36% of the burrows had collapsed. Some subcolonies remain too unstable to allow access for burrow checks.</p>\n<p>A new colony is being established on the Kaikoura Peninsula, with chicks translocated from the Kowhai colony and managed largely by the Hutton&#x2019;s Shearwater Charitable Trust. The 2016-17 breeding season was the most successful yet, with 12 chicks successfully fledged, including the first &#x201C;grand child&#x201D; of the colony (i.e.&#xA0;a chick of a colony-bred&#xA0;bird&#xA0;successfully fledged).</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater colonies are located on steep tussock slopes with deep and friable soil. Burrow density varies within sub-colonies with a mean of 0.5/m2. The peak of egg-laying is in early November with a 50 day incubation period followed by an average of 83 days before the chicks fledge. Most aspects of breeding biology are consistent with the general pattern observed in other <em>Puffinus</em> species, although the period of chick-rearing is longer. This may be due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient food, or the energetic costs associated with breeding in an alpine environment 1200 m above sea level.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Large flocks of Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater gather off the Kaikoura coast during the summer breeding season and are visible from land as well as at sea. These birds fly close to the water in large flocks, settling to feed or rest. A flock of feeding birds may include those that are dipping at the surface for crustaceans and those that pitch in from a low flight to dive for small fish. These dives, propelled by partially-folded wings, can take the birds to depths of 20-30 m. Breeding birds fly in and out of the alpine colonies under cover of darkness. Birds arriving early in the season often find colonies covered in snow, but later in the year the&#xA0;colonies become hot and dry. Non-breeding birds frequent the waters around Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Hutton&#x2019;s shearwaters consume a variety of crustaceans and small fish. Recent research has shown that adults feeding chicks&#xA0;forage 100-300 km south of Kaikoura and up to 250 km offshore. Foraging trips average seven days, with dives averaging 4.7 m in depth.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.huttonsshearwater.org.nz/\">http://www.huttonsshearwater.org.nz/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3942\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3942</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Cuthbert, R. 2001.

Their flight has the typical small shearwater pattern of a series of rapid shallow wing beats followed by a glide and they usually stay close to the surface of the water. The bill is fine and dark grey, but blackish on the top and tip; the legs and feet are blue with pinkish cream webs.</p>\n<p>Voice: a loud harsh rapidly repeated call <em>kakakakakakak-urrr</em>; the last syllable sounds as if the bird is drawing breath while uttering it.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the common small shearwater in northern New Zealand is the fluttering shearwater which is larger and often seen in flocks. They are brownish black rather than black although this is least apparent immediately after the moult. Fluttering shearwaters are extensively brownish under the wings, especially the trailing edge and near the body, the face and sides of their necks are brownish black becoming smudgy. Hutton&#x2019;s shearwaters are very similar to fluttering shearwaters but even darker on the neck and under the wings. Subantarctic little shearwater mainly differs in having a darker face, with the demarcation line between black and white passing below the eye. The common diving petrel can also be mistaken for a little shearwater, especially from a moving boat in choppy water. The diving petrel is also black above and white below, but is smaller and much stouter, with short wings that beat rapidly and continuously in flight.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Little shearwaters are pelagic in temperate to sub-tropical waters, usually on the outer edge of the continental shelf or just beyond. They are mainly seen around the Kermadec Islands and off the coast of the northern half of the North Island, down to about Wellington on the west coast. In addition to the Kermadec Islands, the breeding islands are scattered off the north-eastern coast of the North Island south to the northern Bay of Plenty.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>There are estimated to be about 100,000 pairs of Kermadec little shearwaters breeding on Curtis Island, with hundreds to thousands of pairs on most of the other islands in the group. They were extirpated from Raoul Island by introduced rats and cats (since eradicted). There are probably only about 10,000 pairs of North Island little shearwaters with notable populations on the Alderman Islands (c.4000 pairs) and Red Mercury Island (c.1000 pairs). Other islands have hundreds of pairs at best.</p>\n<p>The Norfolk Island little shearwater, which occasionally visits New Zealand, has a population of about 5000 pairs breeding in the&#xA0;Norfolk and Lord Howe Island groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Not surprisingly for such a small petrel, little shearwaters suffer badly from exotic predators. They can coexist with Pacific rats (kiore) but breeding success and colony size is significantly reduced. They are not able to coexist with Norway or ship rats, feral cats or stoats. Little shearwaters are likely to have benefitted from the eradication of Pacific rats from many of their breeding islands off the north-east North Island (Hen and Chickens, Mokohinau, Mercury and Alderman Islands), and therefore have a conservation ranking of Recovering.</p>\n<p>The Kermadec Islands are active volcanoes and eruptions, especially on Curtis Island where the vast bulk of the population of the endemic subspecies breeds, could be disastrous.</p>\n<p>The breeding burrows are fragile, typically dug into very friable soil, and would be easily crushed by people walking in the breeding colonies.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Little shearwaters nest in burrows in soil, usually under scrub or forest. They are winter breeders but at least a few birds visit the colonies through most of the year. In the Kermadec Islands eggs are laid in mid to late June and July and the young fly between mid-October and early December. The North Island subspecies has a slightly later season with eggs laid in July and early August and the young leaving between mid-November and December.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>At sea, little shearwaters are usually seen alone. They fly close to the water and take prey near the surface by dropping on it from flight, seizing it from the surface or chasing it in shallow dives.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Small fish, squid and crustaceans have all been recorded but their relative importance is unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The subantarctic little shearwater has only recently been separated from the little shearwaters as a species in its own right. The two species are very closely related and probably similar in their ecology and behaviour. They are the smallest shearwaters in the New Zealand region. The subantarctic little shearwater breeds on the Antipodes and Chatham Islands, and also on islands in the South Atlantic Ocean and southern Indian Ocean. It ranges widely in the Southern Ocean. All of the breeding islands are remote and little is known about the biology of this species.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The subantarctic little shearwater is a small black-and-white shearwater with a long fine bill. It is black on the back and the upper wings, greyish in fresh plumage. The tips of the feathers on the upper wings are white so that there are very fine white stripes which may be visible in close views in fresh plumaged birds, but which erode with wear. Extensions of the white flank feathers form white sides to the rump. The underwing is white with a narrow dark margin and some greyish feathering in the wing pits (axillaries) may be visible. The border between the black and white on the face is below the eye, but there may be a pale extension behind the ears. The bill is blackish with blue grey sides, the legs and feet are blue with pale pinkish webs and the eye is black. Subantarctic little shearwaters fly with a typical small shearwater pattern, rapid shallow wing beats followed by a glide.</p>\n<p>Voice: not described</p>\n<p>Similar species: among the species regularly present in the southern ocean, subantarctic little shearwaters are most similar to the much smaller diving petrels, which share their black-and-white plumage.&#xA0;&#xA0;Diving petrels are more heavily built, proportionately shorter winged and have a faster, continuous wing beat. Around the New Zealand coast, fluttering and Hutton&#x2019;s Shearwaters are similar but larger. Both species are to browner above with smudgy dark colouring on the sides of the neck and smudgy brownish colouring under the wing especially near the body and trailing edge. They also have less white on the sides of the rump.</p>\n<p>The subantarctic little shearwater is most similar to the little shearwater, and both could occur in Cook Strait and around the South Island and Chatham Islands. The little shearwater is more lightly built, but the main distinction is the whiter face, with the demarcation line between black and white passing over or through the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>In the New Zealand region, there is a large breeding colony of subantarctic little shearwaters spread amongst the smaller islands in the Antipodes group, and a much smaller one on the Star Keys in the Chatham Islands. On the breeding island, subantarctic little shearwaters burrow into soil under scrub or tussock.</p>\n<p>At sea, subantarctic little shearwaters are mainly seen close to breeding colonies. Large numbers have been seen near the Bounty Islands, they are regularly seen at the Auckland Islands, plus there are records from the Snares and Solander Islands, and Little Mangere Island in the Chatham Islands. Young birds, and adults after breeding, disperse more widely through subantarctic waters, and reach as far as north as the southern North Island and possibly as far east as Chile, although most stay closer to home.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, subantarctic little shearwaters breed on Inaccessible, Nightingale, Tristan da Cunha and Gough Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean, and St Paul Island in the southern Indian Ocean</p>\n<p><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Tens of thousands of pairs of subantarctic little shearwaters breed on the outlying islands of the Antipodes group but they are absent from the main island.

They pass through New Zealand waters twice a year on migration to and from non-breeding feeding areas in the tropical and north temperate Pacific Ocean. Most birds stay well offshore, and up until 1990 they were regarded as rare stragglers, with about 40 New Zealand records. With more observers spending time further offshore in recent years, including specialised birding trips, Wilson&#x2019;s storm petrels have become better known, and are regularly seen on passage.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Wilson&#x2019;s storm petrels are mainly black with a white band across the rump and a grey bar on the inner part of the upperwing. Their bills and legs are black, with bright yellow webs between the toes which can sometimes be seen when close. They fly over the water with steady wing beats and may patter with their feet or run off the sea-surface.</p>\n<p>Voice: the main call is a loud wheezy or nasal grating <em>aark aark</em> given by birds on the ground in their nesting colonies. At sea they are generally silent but quiet low squeaks are sometimes heard from birds feeding in flocks.</p>\n<p>Similar species: there are several other species of black-and-white storm petrels but they do not usually have an entirely black body and under wing. A few white-bellied storm petrels become almost or entirely black, but when they have an entirely black underside, the rump is almost or entirely black also.

Although pied (black-and-white), and similar in appearance to the pied morph of the variable oystercatcher, it is a smaller and stockier bird. Pairs defend coastal territories throughout the year in rocky and sandy sites around the islands of the Chathams.</p>\n<p>The lack of suitable breeding habitat, as a result of clearing the land for farming and introduction of marram grass&#xA0;to the dunes, and predation by introduced animals apparently took a large toll on the oystercatcher population since the 1850s. By 1970 there may have been as few as 50 birds left. Sporadic management improved the situation but by 1998 there were still only about 140 birds in the population. More intensive management over the next 7 years resulted in the population more than doubling to over 300 birds.</p>\n<p><strong><em></em>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island oystercatcher is the only resident oystercatcher species on the Chatham Islands. It is a sturdy shorebird with pied plumage, and a smudgy border between the black and white feathers on the breast. Adults have red eyes, an orange bill and eye-ring, and pink legs and feet. Juveniles have paler skin and a dark-tipped bill; adult characteristics are gradually attained&#xA0;from about 2 years.</p>\n<p>Voice: the staccato high-pitched piping call is used in territorial defence and courtship. Adults also use piercing screech and squawk calls and softer calls are made in flight.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the pied morph of the variable oystercatcher has similar plumage but is a larger bird that has not been recorded on the Chatham Islands. The South Island pied oystercatcher (which has been recorded there) is also similar in appearance, but smaller and less sturdy, and has a more distinct demarcation between the black and white feathering of the chest.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island oystercatchers breed around the rocky and sandy coasts of Chatham, Pitt, Rangatira (South East) and Mangere Islands. More sheltered coastlines are favoured, where there is access to a food supply throughout the tidal cycle, for example a rocky wave platform exposed at low tide, kelp debris or a stream mouth. Occasionally, birds will feed on adjacent farmland, particularly in winter. Territories vary in size from 100 m to 1 km of coastline depending on the habitat quality and protection from predators. Breeders defend their territories throughout the year, but juveniles and subadults tend to move around the islands and may form small flocks, and spend more time in non-breeding areas, including lagoon and pond shorelines. Some Rangatira breeding pairs also regularly forage on Pitt Island, 2 km away.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There were possibly as few as 50 Chatham Island oystercatcher in 1970, 110 in 1987, and 142 in 1998. Intensive management of predators, stock exclusion, and protection of nests from high seas in northern Chatham Island resulted in a rapid population increase by the mid-2000s to over 300 birds, including 89 pairs, for the population as a whole. By 2006 there was a minimum of 313 birds (194&#xA0;in northern Chatham Island, 60&#xA0;elsewhere on the island, and 59&#xA0;on the other three islands). Sporadic, less intensive management at key sites has&#xA0;maintained the population at a similar level, with a minimum of 309 birds recorded in both 2010 and 2014, including about 110 pairs. The population on Rangatira (which is not farmed and has no mammalian predators) has declined steadily from about 12 pairs in the 1970s to 2 pairs in 2016, for reasons that are not understood.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The most significant threat to Chatham Island oystercatchers on Chatham and Pitt Islands is predation by introduced cats. Cats prey on eggs and chicks, and to a lesser extent, adults. Introduced weka also prey on eggs. Trampling of nests by farm animals also occurs. Farming has changed the vegetation on the coast, particularly through the establishment of marram, an introduced grass, to stabilise the dunes. The resulting steep-faced dunes force birds to nest close to the high tide mark, where they are vulnerable to being washed away by storm seas. Sea-level rise caused by climate change may exacerbate this problem. On the southern islands of the group, subantarctic skuas take some eggs and chicks. The population has been through a bottleneck and probably has limited<a name=\"_GoBack\" id=\"_GoBack\"></a> genetic diversity.</p>\n<p>A period of intensive&#xA0;management in northern Chatham Island from 1998-2004 showed that predator control, stock exclusion and re-locating nests away from the high tidemark&#xA0;improved productivity from an average of 0.35 to 1.0 chicks per pair per year. An influx of young birds entering the breeding population at 2-6 years of age more than doubled the population. Trial dune restoration also showed that replacing marram with native vegetation and providing more space in the foredune created a safer nesting environment. Since 2005, management has been less intensive; productivity has fallen significantly and there are now many fewer sub-adults in the population. In recent years, cat control on the north coast of Chatham Island appears to have been much less effective than it was in the early 2000s. </p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island oystercatchers are monogamous and share incubation duties. Nests are a simple scrape in the sand or gravel, or a lined depression on a rocky outcrop. Incubation of the 1-3 eggs is shared and takes about 29 days. The chicks are mobile as soon as they are dry, and rely on hiding and camouflage amongst tidal debris to escape predation. Juveniles can fly at 6 weeks of age and may disperse or stay with their parents for several months. Most birds first breed at 3 or 4 years of age. Once established on a territory, site and mate fidelity are high, but divorce has been recorded occasionally.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island oystercatchers defend their breeding and feeding territories throughout the year. They defend nests and chicks with distraction displays similar to those of other oystercatcher species. Juveniles and sub-adults disperse around the islands but tend to return to their natal areas, or nearby coastline, to breed. Banding has shown there is relatively little movement across Pitt Strait between birds on Chatham Island and those on the southern islands. The oldest known bird was 30+ years of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Oystercatchers use their sturdy bills to prize, hammer, probe or pick for invertebrates in rocky or sandy substrate. Food includes amphipods, polychaete worms, nemerteans (ribbon worms), molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, ascidians and anemones.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/chatham-island-oystercatcher-torea/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/chatham-island-oystercatcher-torea/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chathams.co.nz/index.php/naturalheritage/97-chatham-island-oystercatchers\">http://www.chathams.co.nz/index.php/naturalheritage/97-chatham-island-oystercatchers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/chatham-oystercatcher-haematopus-chathamensis/text\">http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/chatham-oystercatcher-haematopus-chathamensis/text</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand </em>(revised edn).

It is common at wetlands and coastal areas throughout New Zealand and may be seen feeding alongside oystercatchers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pied stilts tend to be shy of people and fly away, yapping, when approached.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The pied stilt is a medium-large wader with very long pink legs and a long, fine, black bill. The body is mainly white with black back and wings, and black on the back of the head and neck. In flight the white body and black on the back of the neck are conspicuous. The underside of the wings is black, and the long pink legs trailing behind are diagnostic. Juvenile birds look similar to adults but the back of the head and neck are mottled fawn or brown and off-white and there is no black band. The wings are not quite as black as in the mature bird.</p>\n<p>Voice: the calls heard most often are high pitched yapping alarm calls. A less strident version is used as a contact call, including by flocks flying at night.</p>\n<p>Similar species: juvenile black stilts may be mistaken for pied stilts. Black stilts are very rare and nest only in the braided rivers of the central South Island, though some migrate to coastal areas and flock with pied stilts. Juvenile black stilts usually have some black on their underparts between the legs and the tail, even if restricted to the flanks. This becomes more extensive at their first moult, and so any stilt with extensive black on the hind belly is likely to be an immature black stilt. Stilts with irregular or mottled black markings are likely to be hybrids between black and pied stilts.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Known elsewhere as the black-winged stilt, the pied stilt is&#xA0;a truly cosmopolitan bird with breeding populations throughout many of the tropical and warmer temperate regions of the world. They are believed to have been in New Zealand since the early 19th century, with the main growth in population from about 1870-1940.</p>\n<p>Pied stilts live in all kinds of wetlands from brackish estuaries and saltmarshes to freshwater lakes, swamps and braided rivers. They feed in shallow water or mud and roost in shallow water or on banks or sandbanks. After the breeding season, birds migrate from inland locations towards more northerly coastal locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>There were an estimated 30,000 pied stilts in New Zealand in the early 1990s.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Pied stilts are numerous and not considered threatened in New Zealand. In contrast to the critically endangered back stilt, pied stilts are able to breed successfully in the presence of the same suite of predatory mammals. Differences that allow the pied stilt to breed more successfully than its black cousins include choice of nest site, and more effective anti-predator behaviours.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Pied stilts in lowland areas start moving towards their breeding sites in June-July each year. Inland birds start later in August-October. Occasionally a single pair will nest alone, but usually they breed in colonies of&#xA0;about 15 pairs. Large colonies may have up to 100 pairs. Both parents build the nest on the ground near water, often in a damp situation, and usually surrounded by or next to water. It may be built up to a few centimetres high with mud, vegetation and debris from nearby. Both adults incubate the 3-4 eggs, which hatch after c.25 days. The chicks leave the nest when dry, and can fly&#xA0;when 28-32 days old. The young are olive-brown to brown and downy with dark blotches on their backs, and white underneath. When hatched they are brooded by their parents but find their own food. The parents continue to care for the young who remain with them even during the end of season migration.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Pied stilts are highly gregarious and tend to stay in groups throughout the year. They feed together and roost together in what can become large and noisy flocks. They often associate with other waders &#x2013; feeding and roosting alongside and flying with birds such as oystercatchers and godwits.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The main foods are invertebrates &#x2013; terrestrial insects and worms when feeding on land, and aquatic insects and larvae when feeding in ponds, swamps and estuaries. In tidal areas the birds feed at low tide regardless of what time that occurs. Pied stilts primarily catch their food by sight, but when wading they may also probe and feel for food, especially when light is poor. When on land they may catch flying insects on the wing.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-winged_Stilt\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-winged_Stilt</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/poaka.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/poaka.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996 (rev 2000). <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Adults are distinctive in having&#xA0;entirely black plumage,&#xA0;long red legs and a thin black bill, but juveniles and subadults can easily be overlooked amongst pied stilts, while hybrids add to the plumage confusion. Black stilts frequent the wide open braided rivers and associated wetlands of the Mackenzie Basin. There they favour shallow waters of invertebrate-rich sidestreams and pools, wading out into deep water if necessary. Some birds migrate to northern New Zealand harbours.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Black stilts are a compact stilt, shorter legged and with a thicker bill than the more common pied stilt, which is entirely white below. Juvenile black stilts in their first winter plumage have a black back, smudgy grey hind neck and variable dark markings on the flank. This plumage darkens in their second summer moult, and by mid-summer they are predominantly black. Adult hybrid stilts have a distinctive black band across their breast, the width of black generally correlating with the amount of black stilt genes in the individual.</p>\n<p>Voice: contact calls are a single or repeated &#x201C;yep&#x201D; call not unlike that of pied stilt. Territorial birds are noisy, having a higher pitched and more penetrating call than the pied stilt.</p>\n<p>Similar species: both species of stilts are immediately separable from oystercatchers by the presence of a relatively thin black bill and long thin red legs, as opposed to oystercatchers possessing long thick, red bills and short, thick red legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>Black stilts were formerly widespread throughout New Zealand, and were still breeding at North Island locations in the late 19th century. During the 20th century the range contracted from being South Island wide to being confined to Canterbury and Otago in the 1950s, South Canterbury-North Otago by the 1970s, and the Mackenzie Basin by the 1980s. Breeding pairs are now confined to the area between the Lake Tekapo and Lake Pukaki basins in the north to the Ahuriri River in the south.</p>\n<p>Outside the breeding season most black stilts move locally within the Mackenzie Basin, but small numbers visit&#xA0; the Canterbury coast, e.g. Lakes Wainono and Ellesmere, and north to Kawhia and Kaipara Harbours in the North Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Typical breeding habitat for black stilts comprises combinations of braided riverbed habitat and nearby wetlands such as swamps, ponds and shallow edges of lakes. Within this mosaic, nesting territories are located in areas with abundant food, e.g. a main river channel if invertebrates such as the mayfly (<em>Deleatidium</em>) are abundant. Alternatively, more stable side-streams, swamps or ponds may be favoured particularly when there has been flooding and scouring of the main river courses.&#xA0; Black stilts will leave their territory to feed in other habitats at sites that are a kilometre or more away.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population currently numbers c.100 birds, including captive birds that are intensively managed.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Black stilts breed mainly in pairs but they can also associate with other pairs of black stilts and colonies of pied stilt. Typically pairs are solitary and territorial, defending their territories against other stilts, and sometimes other waders, if they venture close to chicks. Birds begin to arrive on the breeding grounds and set up territories in July (but often travel daily back and forth to their feeding areas of the last few months). First eggs are laid in September to October, in lined nests in vegetation clumps, open banks, or small depressions. The clutch-size is nearly always four eggs coloured with a green to olive background and with bold dark streaking and blotching. Incubation is performed by the male and female for c.25 days and chicks fledge after another 4-8 weeks. Black stilts first breed at 2 or 3 years of age.</p>\n<p>Most eggs and chicks are lost to mammalian predators, e.g. mustelids (ferrets and stoats), cats, hedgehogs and rats; also natural causes including flooding and harrier predation. A sensitive period can be after sudden declines in the abundance of the mainly rabbit prey of mustelids and cats. Past declines were sometimes sudden and not explained by habitat loss, e.g. some big losses occurred in the 1950s coinciding with extensive rabbit control. Locally habitat loss has also been a factor. Hybridisation with pied stilts (which have similar courtship) and resulting hybrids further complicates the recovery process. Nearly all wild black stilts stem from intensive management, especially captive management.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black stilts are closely adapted to the New Zealand braided riverbed environment and, unlike the pied stilt, are able to exploit prey seeking refuge beneath riverbed stones and can continue to forage in the river whereas pied stilts may opt to depart. This low level of prey activity occurs at high lighting levels (sun high in sky) and when water temperatures are low (e.g. early in morning). They will also take advantage of emergence events of invertebrates, most notably that of the mayfly <em>Deleatidium</em> spp.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black stilts are carnivorous. Inland birds prey mainly on insect larvae, but they take a range of other prey including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and worms, and some terrestrial prey e.g. spiders. In coastal habitats black stilts take a variety of crustaceans, molluscs and worms. They often feed by scything for worms and midge larvae and other prey in soft substrates, particularly if visibility is impaired by waves, rain or darkness (they often feed at night).</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Stilt\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Stilt</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/black-stilt-kaki/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/wetland-birds/black-stilt-kaki/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kaki.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kaki.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/the-black-stilt-1983\">http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/the-black-stilt-1983</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996 (rev 2000). <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

With its chestnut head and neck, and otherwise black-and-white plumage, the red-necked avocet is unlikely to be confused with any other bird given good viewing conditions. Its legs are pale blue-grey and they trail well behind the tail in flight. The wings are broadly tipped with black, as is a part of the back, which in flight gives the impression of a broken dark &#x2018;M&#x2019; against white wings. The chestnut head becomes slightly paler around the base of the bill, and when the feathers are worn, this can become a white ring at the base of the bill.</p>\n<p>Voice: red-necked avocets are largely silent unless disturbed, when a yapping, or wheezy whistling call is heard.</p>\n<p>Similar species: pied stilt can be easily distinguished by the combination of bill shape (straight in the stilt, upturned in the avocet), leg colour (pinkish in the stilt, bluish in the avocet), and head colour (predominantly white for the stilt, chestnut for the avocet). In flight, the more-or-less uniform dark wings of the pied stilt look very different to the striking pattern of the avocet.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Although its breeding is largely confined to south-eastern and south-western Australia, the red-necked avocet is widespread across the southern part of the continent. It is a vagrant to Tasmania, and there is one untraceable record from Norfolk Island at the time when the species was irrupting into New Zealand (1854). Red-necked avocets prefer saline water, but can tolerate anything from fresh to hypersaline. Salt-evaporation ponds, sewage works, and ephemeral ponds, especially when salt levels have risen due to evaporation, are all good habitats. Breeding typically takes place at inland saltlakes, either directly on the ground or amongst low vegetation.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>During 1859-64 there were many records of red-necked avocets in New Zealand, from Whangarei south to Dunedin. It has been suggested that the species bred in New Zealand during that period, but there is no direct evidence that this occurred. Since 1870, there have been only four accepted records: Invercargill (1892), Lake Ellesmere (1912 &amp; 1945), and Westport (February 1968 &#x2013; 1970). There was a probable sighting at Catlins River in April 1952; a more recent record from Port Waikato was never submitted for verification.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>There are no major studies of the social behaviour of the red-necked avocet, apart from some information about their breeding biology. They are hard to approach unnoticed given their preferred habitat. Breeding can take place as a pair, or in colonies of up to 150 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike other species of avocet, the red-necked avocet is not recorded as stirring mud with its bill. The main feeding action is a sweeping back-and-forth of the bill, which can occur whilst wading through the water, whilst swimming, or even when the head is completely submerged. Alternatively, birds peck or jab at prey items, which may include brine shrimps, annelid worms, molluscs, aquatic insects, fish, seeds and vegetation.

It is one of around 40 Arctic breeding wading bird species that migrate south to Australasia and Oceania, some of which fly over the Pacific Ocean and spend the austral summer in New Zealand. They fly in &quot;V&quot; formation flocks non-stop from Alaska to Hawaii, and then onwards to other Pacific Islands including New Caledonia and Fiji, some continuing on to New Zealand. Pacific golden plovers have been recorded as far south as New Zealand&apos;s subantarctic islands, and are the fourth commonest Arctic migrant wader in New Zealand. Breeding adults have striking black-and-white plumage spangled with gold on the back and upper wings, hence the common name. Breeding plumage develops towards the end of the austral summer before the return migration to the Arctic breeding grounds via the East Asian-Australasian flyway. The annual migration &apos;round trip&apos; is 25,000 - 27,000 km.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Pacific golden plover is a medium-sized, long-legged plover with large head and large dark eyes. Adult birds in breeding plumage have black running from the face down the throat and the belly to the underparts and flanks. The black is bordered with white, with black speckling along the white border by the underparts and undertail. The crown, nape, back, upperwings and upper tail are densely spangled with gold, black and white. Birds in post-breeding moult or developing breeding plumage go through gradual variations of colour and marking, which can make identification confusing. The black breast becomes buff-apricot with dark speckling during moult. The buff-apricot wash and dark speckling darkens to black as breeding plumage develops. Adult non-breeding birds have a buff-apricot wash with dark speckling on the breast and dark patches in front of the eyes and a faint ear patch. The sexes are alike. Juvenile birds have more dark speckling on the upperparts, breast and flanks, and a yellower head and breast.</p>\n<p>Voice: the song of the Pacific golden plover is a series of slow, slurred whistles punctuated with pauses. The flight call is a clear melodious two-syllable <em>tlu-ee</em> with accent on the second syllable.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the three golden plover species&#xA0;(Pacific, American and European) are all very similar. The only other one that reaches New Zealand (very rarely) is the American, which is slightly larger, heavier and longer-winged than the slightly longer-legged Pacific. In breeding plumage, the American has all black underparts and flanks, bordered with pure white down to the lower breast. The Pacific has black underparts and flanks bordered with white all around, but with black speckling along the border from the breast to the undertail. In non-breeding plumage, the American golden plover has a grey wash all over (buff-apricot wash in Pacific golden plover), and a more prominent pale eyebrow stripe, making the bird appear &#x2018;capped&#x2019;. When standing, the wing tips of the American golden plover project beyond the end of the tail, whereas the Pacific golden plover&apos;s wing tips are level with the tail. Grey plover is larger and bulkier, with greyer plumage, black &#x2018;armpits&#x2019;, and a white rump and partial wingbar.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Pacific golden plover breeds on Arctic tundra in coastal Siberia and Alaska, mainly north of 60&#xB0; N. They migrate south in August-September on a broad front, heading&#xA0;to southern hemisphere coasts, including Australia, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand.&#xA0;They arrive in New Zealand September-November and depart northwards late March-early April. In New Zealand, Pacific golden plovers usually occur as small flocks of 10-50 birds at harbours and estuaries, plus some lowland lakes. They are widespread in New Zealand with regular sites in summer including: Parengarenga, Rangaunu, Whangarei, Kaipara and Manukau Harbours, the Firth of Thames, Bay of Plenty, Wairoa, Ahuriri, Manawatu,&#xA0;Muriwai (Gisborne),&#xA0;Lakes Ohia, Wairarapa and Ellesmere,&#xA0;Farewell Spit, and Southland estuaries and lagoons. Pacific golden plovers are regularly recorded at the Chatham Islands (Te Whanga Lagoon) and Kermadec Islands, and once at the Auckland Islands (March 1982).</p>\n<p>Pacific golden plover occur on grassland, saltmarsh and upper levels of tidal mudflats. They roost in <em>Sarcocornia </em>saltmarsh along estuaries, or in ploughed fields or short grass.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of Pacific golden plover is estimated to be 190,000 - 250,000 individuals with 300-1200 birds migrating to New Zealand each summer, and very few overwintering.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Pacific golden plover breed in the Arctic on shrub tundra and montane tundra. The nest is a shallow lichen-lined scrape on a dry site among lichen or moss. Breeding birds arrive May-June. They are monogamous and share incubation. The 4 white-buff eggs, spotted and splotched with brown and black, are laid in June, and hatch after c.26 days. Chicks are cared for by both parents, or the male only if the brood is late. Birds depart on migration August-September, with non-breeding birds departing 2-4 weeks earlier. The oldest banded bird recorded was 6 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Pacific golden plovers are strongly migratory, flying in &quot;V&quot; formation flocks. They feed in short vegetation or on open tidal mudflats. When foraging on mudflats, they walk in rapid short bursts, stopping regularly to survey immediate area, often tilting the head sideways and freezing to watch a patch of mud. When the bird sees sign of prey it repeatedly pecks and probes mud, and digs up the food item.

They leave the breeding grounds in August (adults preceding juveniles) and migrate largely via Hudson and James Bay, Gulf of Mexico and the Antilles to southern South America, arriving in September. The return migration begins in February in Argentina and continues to North American prairies in March-May and arriving at breeding grounds in May-June.</p>\n<p>Breeding habitat is tundra, whereas wintering habitat in South America is short-grassed fields, prairies, ploughed land, wetlands, sandflats and mudflats.

The back and crown are spangled grey, as are the upper wings, which also possess a white wing bar. The rump, undertail and vent are white. The tail is barred. In breeding plumage the grey plover has a black belly and chest with black extending up to the eyes. The black is surrounded by a white margin, which is thick on the face and chest, but thin on the belly. In non-breeding plumage the belly, chest and face are mottled grey, and there is a broad, but faint supercilium. The plumage may show a slight yellow tinge. The most characteristic features when seen in flight are the black &#x2018;armpits&#x2019; (axillaries). The flight is fast with rapid wing beats. Grey plovers feed by running and pausing, then picking from the surface or just beneath.</p>\n<p>Voice: loud, melancholic, far-carrying slurred whistle <em>tlee-oo-ee</em>, with the second syllable lower than the first and third.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the three golden plover species are similar in size, but are much more colourful, although in dull light may look similar in colour. However, these species are slightly smaller and more slender, have grey or white (not black) axillaries, and do not have the white rump and wing bar of grey plover. Non-breeding New Zealand&#xA0;dotterel may appear similar but is smaller, has &#x2018;scaley&#x2019; rather than spangled back plumage, shorter legs, and does not have the grey plover&#x2019;s white rump or black axillaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The grey plover breeds in northern Russia, Canada and Alaska, and migrates to the coasts of western Europe, Africa, including Madagascar, southern Asia, Australia, and America south of the Canadian border. It is found at coastal sites in New Zealand, in particular Farewell Spit. It stays predominantly on the coast feeding on intertidal mudflats and roosting on shellbanks and sandspits, but in Europe it also occurs at inland pools and occasionally on farmland with golden plover.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The grey plover has a world population of about 692,000 birds, with about an estimated 12,000 migrating to Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Typically fewer than five grey plovers are recorded in New Zealand each summer, with Farewell Spit being the most regular site. The first New Zealand record was from the Firth of Thames in 1948. Other sites have included Parengarenga Harbour, Kaipara Harbour, Manukau Harbour, Maketu, Manawatu estuary, Waimea Inlet, Lake Grassmere (Marlborough), Christchurch, Warrington and Awarua Bay. Grey plover have also been recorded twice each from both the Kermadec and Chatham Islands. The largest flock in New Zealand was 12 at Farewell Spit in 1994.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The grey plover breeds in low tundra in the high Arctic.

There are two widely separated subspecies: the northern New Zealand dotterel is more numerous, and breeds around the North Island; the southern New Zealand dotterel was formerly widespread in the South Island, and now breeds only on Stewart Island. Southern New Zealand dotterels are larger, heavier, and darker than northern New Zealand dotterels.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Coastal development and human recreational activities on beaches are having a growing impact on the northern subspecies; dotterels are often described as &#x2018;appealing&#x2019;, and local communities are increasingly championing them &#x2013; providing advocacy and organising protection programmes to improve breeding success.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand dotterel is a heavily-built plover, and is the largest species in the genus <em>Charadrius</em> (c.31 species). The upperparts are brown, darker in the southern subspecies, and the underparts are off-white in autumn-early winter, becoming orange-red (also darker in southern birds) from about May onwards. The depth and extent of red colour varies individually and seasonally, but males are generally darker than females. The bill is heavy and black, and the legs mid-grey. First-winter birds have pure white underparts, with legs yellowish to pale grey.</p>\n<p>Voice: the common call is a sharp <em>chip</em>, often heard before the bird is seen. The call indicates alertness, with the rate increasing as the perceived threat level rises. The same call is also used to maintain contact. A high-pitched <em>tseep</em> is used to warn chicks to stay hidden. A long rattling <em>churr</em> is used when chasing intruders. A sharp <em>werr-wit</em> is used during territory boundary disputes.</p>\n<p>Similar species: occasional confusion with eclipse or juvenile banded dotterel, but New Zealand dotterel is much larger, and bill heavier. Juvenile or eclipse New Zealand dotterel is similar to eclipse greater sand plover (rare in New Zealand) but that has slimmer body, longer legs, and the head appears larger in proportion to the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand dotterels are found on or near the coast around much of the North Island. They are sparse on the west coast from about Taharoa north to North Cape, and there are a few isolated pairs in Taranaki. The bulk of the population is on the east coast between North Cape and East Cape. It has spread south of East Cape since 1990, but is still thinly spread in that area. In 2012, a pair bred at Riversdale (northern Wairarapa), the most southerly breeding record for the subspecies. Subsequent records further south have included at Tora and Baring Head.</p>\n<p>New Zealand dotterels were previously throughout the South Island, breeding inland and wintering on the coast. Breeding is now confined to Stewart Island. Most birds winter on the island, but one flock is at Awarua Bay, Southland. A few juveniles wander the South Island coast, and are frequently recorded as far north as Farewell Spit, with one bird travelling as far as Auckland, before returning to Stewart Island.</p>\n<p>There are major differences in breeding habitat between the two subspecies. Northern birds mainly breed on sandy beaches and sandspits, some on shell banks in harbours, a few on gravel beaches. On beaches, they are usually clustered around stream-mouths. In urban areas (particularly Auckland) they often breed a short distance inland on short grass (golf courses, motorway verges, beside airport runways) or on bare ground (building sites, quarries). Southern birds breed on exposed subalpine herbfields and rocky areas above the tree-line on Stewart Island, but are coastal during the non-breeding season, feeding on inter-tidal mudflats and beaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>A total of 2075 northern New Zealand dotterels was counted in the 2011 breeding-season census.</p>\n<p>Southern New Zealand dotterels reached a low of 62 birds in 1992, but they responded well to management, and the post-breeding population fluctuated between 240 and 290 birds from 2005-2013. Since then, there has been another decline, and in 2015 there were fewer than 200 birds. The reason for the recent decline is unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Breeding success of Northern New Zealand dotterels is usually low at unmanaged sites. The main threats are loss of eggs and chicks to mammalian and avian predators, disturbance from human activities on beaches, loss of nests to big tides, and loss or degradation of habitat from development. Protection programmes began in the 1980s, and normally include predator control, fencing of nesting areas, appointment of wardens to reduce disturbance, and advocacy. About 20-25% of the population is now managed, but effort and success vary between sites and years. The subspecies is conservation dependent &#x2013; stable or declining where unmanaged, increasing where managed.</p>\n<p>Southern New Zealand dotterels were extirpated from the South Island by about 1900 following introduction of stoats and other mustelids. There was a rapid decline of the relict population on Stewart Island from the 1950s due to predation of adults by cats (and possibly rats). Males incubate at night, and are more vulnerable; a severe gender bias developed, with female-female pairs forming. The population was reduced to 18 male-female pairs by 1992, when cat and rat control was initiated. The population has since recovered, but its breeding range remains confined to Stewart Island, and it is conservation dependent.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand dotterels breed in monogamous pairs, and vigorously defend territories against other dotterels. The nests of northern New Zealand dotterels are simple scrapes in the substrate, sometimes sparsely lined or decorated, often with a marker of driftwood or vegetation. Three eggs are laid, usually from August or September, and are replaced if lost. Incubation usually takes 28-30 days; the fledging period is variable, but averages about 6 weeks. Double-brooding has been recorded but is not common. In both subspecies, female-female pairs occasionally form and lay combined clutches numbering 4-6 eggs.</p>\n<p>Nests of southern New Zealand dotterels are usually hollows in cushion plants or between rocks; they are extensively lined, commonly with tussock tillers. They typically nest later then northern birds, from October. Incubation and fledging times not well known; limited data suggest these are similar to those of the northern subspecies.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Both subspecies form post-breeding flocks, typically at large estuaries. They gather from January, and numbers peak in March. Some northern birds move back to breeding sites from May, with all gone by August. Flocks of the southern subspecies stay together throughout winter.</p>\n<p>New Zealand dotterels undertake distraction displays to lead intruders away from nests and chicks; include &#x2018;rat-runs&#x2019; and injury-feigning. Small chicks crouch and &#x2018;freeze&#x2019; when danger threatens; older chicks typically run to the nearest cover and hide. Juveniles often wander widely before settling to breed. Once established on a territory, they are usually faithful to breeding and flock sites, moving predictably between them. Mate-fidelity is high, but divorces have been recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand dotterels consume a wide range of suitably-sized marine, littoral, and terrestrial invertebrates, and occasionally small fish. Sandhoppers are a common prey item on beaches, and small mussels are taken from rocks. Small crabs and annelid worms are among prey on estuaries; on grass, crickets, flies, beetles, and earthworms have been recorded. Most prey is live, but recently-dead items are occasionally scavenged.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/nz-dotterel-tuturiwhatu/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/nz-dotterel-tuturiwhatu/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/nzdotterel.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/nzdotterel.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/new-zealand-dotterel/charadrius-obscurus/\">http://www.arkive.org/new-zealand-dotterel/charadrius-obscurus/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Dowding, J.E. 1994.

The ringed plover in breeding plumage generally has a longer and thicker eye-stripe but that varies between the sexes; the white patch on the forehead is larger; black on the head is more extensive; the orbital eye-ring is incomplete or dark orange, the breast band is normally wider in any plumage, and the bill is slightly longer. Calls of ringed plovers are similar to those of semipalmated plovers. In the hand, the ringed plover has webbing only between the outer and middle front toes, whereas semipalmated plover has webbing between all three front toes although this is very small between inner and middle toes and very difficult to see in the field. Lesser sand plover is larger, with a longer bill, dark legs, and no white hind collar.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The semipalmated plover breeds across northern Canada and Alaska, with a small population breeding in Chukotka, Russia. These probably migrate across the Bering Sea and join North American birds wintering along coasts of the southern USA and much of coastal South America. The New Zealand records are probably Chukotka birds. Migration distance to New Zealand would be similar to that of birds migrating to South America. The semipalmated plover is a rare straggler to Australia, where there are more records of the more westerly-breeding ringed plover.</p>\n<p>A range of coastal habitats used when not breeding, including estuaries, mudflats, beaches and sewage ponds. New Zealand records were of birds on the mudflats and shellbanks of the Firth of Thames and Manukau Harbour, including one bird that moved between these sites.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The first bird to be identified as a semipalmated plover was present on the Manukau Harbour and Firth of Thames during 2009-11. It was caught at Miranda in October 2010, when webbing between its toes was checked, and a weight of 45 g was recorded. The two previous records were of single birds in the Firth of Thames in 1970-71 and in 1983-85. These two birds were initially accepted as ringed plovers but a review of the sightings, and especially photographs by the OSNZ Records Appraisal Committee has determined that the 1970 record was not identified conclusively and has been removed from the list. The 1983 bird is now considered to have been a semipalmated plover, and consequently ringed plover has been removed from the New Zealand list and has been replaced with semipalmated plover.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The global population of semipalmated plovers appears to be stable and is estimated at more than 150,000 birds. It is not clear how many are in Russia.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Classed as of Least Concern by IUCN, this species uses a wide range of habitats and migration stopover sites and is thus less threatened than those species using restricted habitats and specific staging sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The semipalmated plover breeds across the whole of Alaska and much of northern Canada. The nest is a shallow depression in gravel or sand, lichen, moss or grassy-tundra, lined with material from around nest site. The clutch is usually 4 eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"2\">The semipalmated plover is a typical plover with the characteristic run-stop-pick way of gathering food that most plovers use. There is little information from the East Asian-Australasian Flyway where it is a rare vagrant to a few countries, and little is known about the species in Siberia.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The semipalmated plovers consume a wide range of invertebrates in freshwater and estuarine habitats</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipalmated_Plover\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipalmated_Plover</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3117\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3117</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/444/articles/introduction\">http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/444/articles/introduction</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brazil, M. 2009. <em>Birds of East Asia</em>, Eastern China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Eastern Russia.

Like many of Australia&#x2019;s birds which rely on water for their breeding strategies, it has adapted to respond to suitable wetland habitat becoming available. For example, red-capped plovers often move in response to rain events in the interior.</p>\n<p>The majority of shorebirds in Australia are summer migrants, the exceptions being the single winter migrant species, New Zealand&#x2019;s banded dotterel, and a small number of breeding residents such as the red-capped plover and black-fronted dotterel. The red-capped plover forms a superspecies with the snowy plover of North America, Kentish plover of North Africa and Asia, white-fronted plover of Southern Africa, and Javan plover of Indonesia.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The red-capped plover is a small plover with white underparts and grey-brown upperparts, with both sexes possessing a white forehead, and the male with a bright rufous crown and nape, bordered by a black frontal band. The female has a paler version of this cap, with the rufous replaced by a light grey-orange and the black frontal band by a darkish grey. In the male, the rufous nape extends down the back of the neck towards the breast and is again bordered by black on its anterior margin. The female has this also, but lacking the black border and less strongly rufous. There is little variation between seasons, but there is considerable individual variation. Juveniles look not unlike the dullest end of variation in the adult female. An adult male should present no identification problems, but dull females and juveniles can be difficult to distinguish from immature and non-breeding banded dotterel. In flight, a clear white wing bar and white outer tail are visible.</p>\n<p>Voice: a range of contact calls <em>wit-wit-wit</em>, alarm calls <em>twink</em>, decoy display <em>chirring</em>, ticking, flight call <em>prrrt </em>and parental summoning calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: Kentish plover, which is vagrant to Australia (not recorded from New Zealand), is slightly larger, with a longer and thinner bill, longer white supercilium, complete white collar, and larger dark breast patches. Lesser sand plover and banded dotterel are both larger than red-capped plover at 18-21 cm. The banded dotterel has a larger bill, is plainer and darker above, and shows less contrast in flight when viewed from above. A non-breeding adult banded dotterel shows at least some sign of its two bands at the side of the breast. Juveniles often have a suffusion of buff around the head and neck. In all plumages, the pale supercilium extends further back on banded dotterel. Lesser sand plover has a shorter, thicker bill than red-capped plover, is darker and plainer above, has larger dark patches at the side of the breast, and a more prominent supercilium.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Restricted to mainland Australia and Tasmania, red-capped plover is largely found near the coast in the southern half of the continent. Apart from vagrancy to New Zealand, there is a doubtful record from southern New Guinea. It prefers saline water, but can tolerate anything from fresh to hypersaline situations. It occurs on a wide variety of wetlands, from ephemeral inland salt lakes to estuarine mudflats, and sometimes far from water on dry claypans and grassland.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>First recorded from New Zealand in 1878 near Waikanae, the red-capped plover was not reported again until 1947, when a female interbred with a male banded dotterel at the Ashley River in North Canterbury. Up to eight birds were seen at this location until 1980 and breeding occurred in several North Canterbury rivers during this period. Although largely seen in the South Island, there are some records from 1966-1968 from Miranda. The last sighting in New Zealand was a bird at Lake Ellesmere in January 1981.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Predominantly a summer breeder around the coasts of Southern Australia, the red-capped plover also responds to inland rains and travels to take advantage of the good conditions. Its nest is an unlined scrape into which two black spotted, pale yellow-brown eggs are laid. Like many plovers, &#x2018;broken-wing displays&#x2019; are used to lure potential predators away from nests when eggs or young are present.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Red-capped plovers consume small invertebrates, mainly molluscs, crustaceans and annelids (worms), with some plant material. Food items are gathered using the characteristic &#x2018;stop-run-peck&#x2019; technique typically utilised by members of the genus <em>Charadrius.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/red-capped-plover-charadrius-ruficapillus\">http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/red-capped-plover-charadrius-ruficapillus</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/red-capped-plover\">http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/red-capped-plover</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Charadrius-ruficapillus\">http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Charadrius-ruficapillus</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-capped_Plover\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-capped_Plover</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.waders.org.au/about-waders/shorebird-identification/waders-regularly-seen-in-australia-p-t/red-capped-plover/\">http://www.waders.org.au/about-waders/shorebird-identification/waders-regularly-seen-in-australia-p-t/red-capped-plover/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J.

It is sometimes said to have been both discovered and exterminated by a lighthouse keeper&#x2019;s cat. This bird may have been seen by workers constructing the first lighthouse on Stephens Island (outer Marlborough Sounds) in 1892, but it was unequivocally made known by that cat when the keepers settled there in 1894. The disappearance of the Lyall&#x2019;s wren was very quick as the island became over run with feral cats which probably did originate from the lighthouse settlement, the last one known was brought in by&#xA0;David Lyall&apos;s&#xA0;cat in February 1895 as the cats started making noticeable inroads into the remarkable bird fauna that had survived on Stephens Island in the absence of any exotic predators.</p>\n<p>More interesting is the fact that Lyall&#x2019;s wren could not fly. There was no keel on the breast bone to anchor the flight muscles, the wings were very short and rounded and the feathers were loose, so the flight feathers were not airtight. Just five species of song birds out of about 4000 species were flightless.

When the bones of these small birds were finally examined properly it became clear that there were seven species in five genera living at the time of first human settlement, representing a substantial radiation within the country.

They also had long, stout toes with weakly curved claws.

Acanthisittidae was the earliest family of songbirds to separate from the rest of the Order, and so they are the sister group to all other songbirds. Only the rifleman and rock wren are extant. The long-billed wren was the rarest of the recent acanthisittids and is known from the remains of possibly 6 individuals from 4 cave sites in northwest Nelson and Southland. The holotype (NMNZ S27775, partial skeleton) and paratype (NMNZ S22940, a mandible) are held at the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa.

The long-billed wren had a large head, small wings, and short, relatively weak legs. Its most distinguishing feature was a long, down-curved bill from which its specific name is derived. The etymology of its generic name comes from the Greek <em>dendros</em> (a tree) and Latin <em>scando</em>, <em>scansus</em> (climb) referring to its supposed arboreal, trunk-foraging habit. However, it now appears that the bird lived mainly in subalpine scrub and tussock and was absent from the lowland forest of eastern South Island. Like other New Zealand wrens it was probably an insectivore.</p>\n<p>The long-billed wren is known from late Pleistocene and Holocene deposits and probably became extinct shortly after human settlement.

More likely to be heard than seen, North Island kokako have persisted in small populations particularly in the central North Island from the King Country through to Te Urewera. They typically inhabit tall native forest dominated by tawa (<em>Beilschmiedia tawa</em>), singing from tree-tops but often feeding in understorey layers.</p>\n<p>All mainland North Island populations persist only with sustained control of key pest mammals (ship rats and brushtail possums). All unmanaged populations are extinct.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The North Island kokako is a large songbird with a blue-grey body, a striking black mask and small, rich blue wattles that arise from the base of the bill and sit under the throat. Typically, when seen backlit in forest, kokako seem dark-plumaged and neither mask nor wattles are seen. They have long, strong legs and a long down-curved tail. Kokako characteristically bound and run among branches, interspersed with glides on short, rounded wings. They are usually located by listening for song and calls. The sexes are alike; juveniles have pink or lilac wattles. A few adults have orange wattles (cf. South Island kokako).</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Voice: rich, sonorous, sustained, organ-like notes are sung by both male and female North Island kokako, frequently as duet, and typically from a high perch.&#xA0; There is a frequent close contact call of &#x2018;took&#x2019;, repeated variably.&#xA0;</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Similar species: tui have similar silhouette and song (especially when mimicking kokako where they coexist), but they are much smaller, darker and more adept fliers, with very different head and throat ornamentation. Vagrant black-faced cuckoo-shrike from Australia is half the size, paler grey, lacks wattles, and is a bird of open woodlands, parks and gardens rather than dense native forest.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Natural remnant North Island kokako populations are confined to a few scattered forests in the northern half of the North Island, particularly in the Waikato, Bay of Plenty,&#xA0;Te Urewera, South Auckland and Northland. Since 1981, has been successfully translocated to Little Barrier, Kapiti and Tiritiri Matangi Islands, Mount Bruce Scenic Reserve (Wairarapa), Boundary Stream Mainland Island (Hawkes Bay), Ngapukeriki (East Cape), Ark in the Park (Waitakeres, west Auckland), Whirinaki and Otanewainuku (Bay of Plenty), Maungatautari (Waikato) and Puketi (Northland). They characteristically reside in tall, diverse native forest, usually with a canopy of tawa or taraire with emergent podocarps or kauri. Kokako have successfully bred in planted diverse shrub- and tree- hardwoods on Tiritiri Matangi Island.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The North Island kokako population has increased from c.330 pairs in 1999 to&#xA0;c.1595 in 2017 due to pest control at key sites, and translocation. The largest populations, with more than 100 pairs each, are in Pureora Forest, Hauturu (Little Barrier Island ), Te Urewera, and Mapara (Waikato). Other large populations (&gt; 50 prs) are at Mataraua/Waima (Northland), Hunua Ranges, Kaharoa-Onaia and Rotoehu near Rotorua, and there are 14 other smaller populations. Breeding pairs and unpaired singles defend 4-25 ha territories year-round by singing, which limits density.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Predation at nests by ship rats and possums is the primary cause of current declines of North Island kokako. Food reduction mainly by possums and predation by stoats are unhelpful secondary factors. All current populations must be continually managed against introduced mammal pests, either by repeated pest control on the mainland, or by vigilance against pest invasion on islands. Ship rats and possums are routinely targeted by trapping and poisoning so that their numbers are low for the duration of the breeding season (November to February). Food supply influences the number of breeding attempts that kokako make, but nest predators determine the outcomes of these attempts. Several key populations are being restored primarily by community groups. Maintenance of genetic health also influences management; e.g. new populations are established with individuals from two different source populations, totalling &gt;40 founders. The conservation status of this species was moved from nationally vulnerable to &apos;at risk - recovering&apos; in 2013.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">North Island kokako typically raise one brood during November-February, after which they moult. In occasional years of good food supply, the breeding season may last 6 months and up to three broods can be raised. Two-three pinkish-grey eggs are laid in cup nests c.13 m (range 3-25 m) up trees. Incubation is by the female alone for c.18 days. Both adults feed the nestlings. Young fledge at 32-37 days old, and so nests are vulnerable to predation for about 7 weeks. Fledged young usually remain in parents&apos; territory for a few months, up to a year, and continue to be fed by both parents. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">North Island kokako defend large territories year-round by complex singing, including the longest known duetting of any songbird in the world. They are poor fliers; they usually bound around trees with their strong legs and with small wingflaps, but may glide some hundreds of metres down gullies from treetops. Net natal dispersal is usually c.1.4 km, but juveniles travel many kilometres around local territories before settling. Kokako populations are easily isolated by forest fragmentation. The tall forests they inhabit and their alert and skulking behaviour mean that most kokako are detected by their song and other vocalisation, frequently delivered from the tops of tall trees at dawn. Birds are captured by attracting them to mist-nets with playback. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">North Island kokako mainly eat fruit and leaves and, less often, flowers, moss, buds, nectar and invertebrates. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dkako\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dkako</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/kokako/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/kokako/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p align=\"left\"><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Ewen, J.G.; Flux, I.; Ericson, P.G.P. 2006.

South Island kokako were slightly smaller and darker than the North Island birds, with orange rather than blue facial wattles. In the early 1800s, they occupied beech forests and low scrub above the tree line on both sides of Southern Alps from north-west Nelson south to Fiordland, and mixed podocarp forest on Stewart Island, plus&#xA0;some forested areas of Otago and Southland. They declined markedly after introductions of cats, ship rats and stoats, and were very rare by the late 1800s. The range of the South Island kokako shrank to Fiordland and Stewart Island, with the last accepted twentieth century sighting at Mt Aspiring National Park in 1967. Declared extinct by the Department of Conservation in 2008, the species&apos; conservation status was moved from extinct to data deficient in 2013, leading to&#xA0;acceptance of a sighting from near Reefton on the West Coast of the South Island in 2007.</p>\n<p>The South Island kokako was one of 5 species of New Zealand wattlebirds, an endemic family that includes the living North Island kokako and saddlebacks (2 species) and the extinct huia. Genetic comparisons have revealed that the New Zealand wattlebirds share a common ancestor with satinbirds, berrypeckers and longbills of New Guinea. All have rounded wings, limited powers of sustained flight, and use bounds, hops and jumps to move around forests.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The South Island kokako was a large blue-grey bird with a black facial mask, large dark eyes, and two orange fleshy wattles at the base of the short robust slightly curved black bill. The orange wattles were blue at the base, and held compressed under the throat. They had a long, rounded tail with blackish-tipped feathers and long dark bluish-grey legs. South Island kokako bounded, hopped and ran from branch to branch and on the forest floor, interspersed with glides on short, rounded wings. They were described as being stronger flyers than North Island kokako, perhaps because their wings were slightly longer. The sexes were alike. Nestlings had rosy pink wattles that became orange with age, and a flesh coloured bill with a greenish tinge at the tip of the upper mandible.</p>\n<p>Voice: slow, organ-like notes sung by male and female, usually as a duet. Also low <em>kuk-kuk</em> or <em>k&#xFC; kuk</em> calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the North Island kokako is paler, with (usually) blue wattles, an ashy grey edging to the facial mask. The few &#x2018;orange wattled&#x2019; kokako recorded in the North Island are assumed to be colour variants of <em>C</em>. <em>wilsoni</em>, the North Island kokako. Vagrant black-faced cuckoo-shrike from Australia is half the size, paler grey, lacks wattles, and is a bird of open woodlands, parks and gardens rather than dense native forest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Subfossil bones of South Island kokako are common in deposits all over the South Island. Its range was reduced by forest being replaced with open country across much of eastern South Island following Maori settlement. Kokako remained locally common in some remote areas into the 1870s but declined markedly through the 1880s until few fragmented populations remained by 1900. Most records were from the West Coast of the South Island from North-west Nelson to Fiordland, but they were also reported from Marlborough, Banks Peninsula, Arthurs Pass, Mt Cargill, Catlins, Southland and Stewart Island. South Island kokako were recorded from the coast to the tree-line in forest dominated by southern beech, southern rata, kamahi and rimu, as well as subalpine scrub.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Described as locally abundant in Dusky and Queen Charlotte Sounds, where specimens were collected by Solander and Forster on Cook&#x2019;s voyages in the late 1700s, and on Mount Alexander near Arthur&#x2019;s Pass by Andreas Reischek in 1873. No census data exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Predation by introduced mammalian predators was the main cause of extinction of the South Island kokako, with ship rats, feral cats and stoats likely to have had the greatest impact. They declined markedly after the spread of ship rats in the 1860s and stoats and weasels in the 1880s. South Island kokako were described as rapidly approaching extinction in 1889 when North Island kokako were still relatively common. It has been suggested the difference in survival rate of the two species was due to the tendency of South Island kokako to spend longer feeding on the forest floor and to nest closer to the ground than North Island kokako, making them more vulnerable to mammalian predators. Like huia, South Island kokako were described as ecologically naive. An incubating bird tolerated a close approach without giving an alarm call or defending young. Maori traditionally hunted kokako, and large numbers were killed for sale to European collectors and museums. Declared extinct by the Department of Conservation in 2008, the species&apos; conservation status was moved from extinct to data deficient in 2013 following the acceptance of a sighting from near Reefton on the West Coast of the South Island in 2007.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>South Island kokako reportedly began courtship displays in October, with the male performing an &#x2018;archangel&#x2019; display to the female, raising and spreading his wings and tail, and bowing his head while making a gurgling noise. The nest was a massive structure in &quot;thick scrub, not far from the ground, of twigs and moss&quot; (Potts). A woven base of sticks and sprays supported a basin-shaped nest-bowl of twigs and <em>sphagnum </em>moss lined with soft grass. Two-three stone-coloured eggs (40.2 x 27.5 mm) with purplish and brown spots were laid in the lined central cup of the nest (40 cm external diameter, 20 cm internal diameter, 9 cm depth) December-January. The c.18 day incubation was undertaken by the female during December-February, with the male feeding her during courtship, incubation and brooding. The nestling period was mainly January-February, with partially downy nestlings left for periods during daytime. Young were fully grown by May. Fledged young were described as remaining with their parents until the following breeding season. It is likely that only a single brood was raised per season.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>South Island kokako were likely to have been monogamous and territorial. Adult birds moved around in pairs, with the male leading. Foraging social groups of up to 7 also recorded. One record of 20 birds travelling through forest on foot together, &quot;... Indian fashion, in single file, passing rapidly over the ground by a succession of hops, and following their leader like a flock of sheep&quot;. McLean described how they , &quot;... used the wings much more than <em>wilsoni </em>[North Island kokako] and shewed a fairly good power of flight.&quot; Potts described male and female as inseparable: &quot;male utters a very sweet whistle, consisting of six notes, as &#x201C;<em>te, to, ta, tu, tu, tu</em>&#x201D;; the call of the female is composed of five, as &#x201C;<em>te, a, tu, tu, tu</em>..&#x201D; Like other New Zealand wattlebird species, South Island kokako often held food in one foot when feeding. They defended large territories with their complex song. Kokako song is one of the slowest of any songbird species, and the duets are said to be the longest of any songbird species.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>South Island kokako diet consisted mainly of leaves and fruits including karamu, <em>Coprosma</em> species, New Zealand sow thistle, konini and tutu, and, less often, flowers, moss, buds, nectar and small insects and invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=2804\">http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=2804</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dkako\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dkako</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.southislandkokako.org/\">http://www.southislandkokako.org/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Barker, F.K.; Cibois, A.; Schikler, P.; Feinstein, J; Cracraft, J. 2004.

They call frequently, particularly in response to disturbance, and are very active, noisy foragers. They are about the size of a European blackbird. Saddlebacks were widespread at European contact, but rapidly declined on the mainland following the introduction of predatory mammals, especially ship rats and stoats. By the early 1900s, North Island saddlebacks were confined to a single population on Hen Island (Taranga) off the northeast coast of the North Island. A series of successful translocations was initiated by the New Zealand Wildlife Service in the 1960s, and there are now 15 island populations and five at predator-fenced mainland sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>North Island saddlebacks have striking black plumage, a rufous chestnut saddle across their back, bright reddish-orange wattles (that get larger with age) and a thin&#xA0;pale yellow&#xA0;band on the leading edge of the saddle. Sexes are alike, although males usually have larger wattles than females of the same age. Juveniles are similar but their plumage lacks the sheen of adults, with dusty brown tips on black body feathers,&#xA0;the gold band is absent, and they have small wattles.</p>\n<p>Voice: a loud chattering call <em>cheet te-te-te-te</em> is uttered throughout the day. Territorial male birds sing male rhythmical song which is characterised by 2-4 introductory chips followed by a series of highly stereotyped and repeated phrases. Over 200 different types of male rhythmical song have been recorded. Male and female birds also give sexually dimorphic quiet calls which are very soft and flute like.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the closely related South Island saddleback now confined to small islands and one fenced sanctuary, all south of Cook Strait.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>The single remaining natural population of around 500 birds is on Hen Island. There are translocated populations on Whatupuke (established in 1964), Red Mercury (1966), Cuvier (1968), Lady Alice (1971), Stanley (1977), Little Barrier (1984-1988), Tiritiri Matangi (1984), Kapiti (1987-1989), Mokoia (1992), Moutuhora (1999), Motuihe (2005), and Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands (2011-2012). Coppermine Island was naturally colonised from Whatupuke Island in the 1970s. There are mainland populations at five fenced sanctuaries, Karori Sanctuary (2002), Bushy Park (2006),Tawharanui Regional Park (2012),&#xA0;Cape Sanctuary, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay (2013) and Maungatautari (2013).</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>North Island saddlebacks frequent coastal and inland forests, particularly scrubby regenerating areas, ranging from sea level to more than 600 m above sea level.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>North Island saddlebacks can be very abundant in suitable habitat free of introduced mammals. Recent population estimates suggest there are more than 7000 birds across all populations. However, many of the island estimates are not based on formal counts and the actual number is likely to be much higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Cavity-roosting and nesting behaviour makes North Island saddlebacks extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced mammals. Therefore, they can only exist at sites where exotic mammalian pests are either completely excluded or are at virtually zero density. Translocation has been essential for the conservation management of North Island saddlebacks (see Distribution).</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Typically spring and summer breeders. Female North Island saddlebacks build a cup nest of vegetation in tree cavities, rock crevices, tree fern crowns, epiphytes and in dense ground level vegetation. Artificial nest boxes are used on some islands. The clutch size is 1-4 and they can rear up to four broods in a season (typically 1-2 in established populations). The female incubates and broods but both parents feed and care for young.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>North Island saddlebacks are extremely active foragers utilising the forest floor to the canopy. They often have other species in attendance whilst feeding, particularly fantails and whiteheads. They use their bill as an anvil to chip away at rotten wood, investigate under cabbage tree skirts and epiphytes, burrow into leaf litter and glean branches, trunks and leaves. They are relatively weak fliers but have very stout legs that are used whilst feeding and for bounding through vegetation.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Invertebrates, fruits and nectar.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/saddleback-tieke/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/saddleback-tieke/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddleback_%28bird%29\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddleback_%28bird%29</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996 (rev 2000). <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

This endemic species is most famous for being saved from extinction in 1964, when 36 birds were translocated from rat-infested Big South Cape Island (off Stewart Island) to nearby Big and Kaimohu Islands. This was the first time that a rescue translocation had prevented a species from becoming extinct anywhere in the world. Descendents from the original translocated populations have since been introduced or reintroduced to numerous other sites (mainly offshore islands) and South Island saddlebacks are no longer at a high risk of extinction. Saddlebacks are in the endemic New Zealand &#x2018;wattlebird&#x2019; family (Callaeidae), along with kokako and the extinct huia. The wattlebird family is thought to have close affinities to the stitchbird (Family Notiomystidae).</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The South Island saddleback is a medium-sized songbird. Adults are black with a chestnut-coloured saddle across their back, while juveniles (commonly referred to as &#x2018;jackbirds&#x2019;) are entirely covered in chocolate brown plumage for their first year. Saddlebacks have distinctive fleshy, orange wattles on the sides of their mouths. The wattles of fledglings are small and indistinguishable from the gape; older birds generally have larger wattles than younger birds. Sexes are difficult to distinguish in the field except through differences in behaviour (i.e. males courtship feed their female partners, and only females incubate eggs). Males tend to have larger wattles and longer tarsus and wing lengths, and are heavier than females but the sexes can overlap in their measurements.</p>\n<p>Voice: vocalisations of the South Island saddleback can be described as <em>cheeet ta-chet ta-chet ta-chet </em>or <em>cheee cheee cheee</em>. Phrases of some vocalisations are often shared between neighbours, which is important in maintaining territories year-round.</p>\n<p>Similar species: North Island saddleback (which does not overlap in range) does not have a separate juvenile (jackbird) plumage, has a pale yellow band at the front edge of the saddle, and is slightly smaller with larger wattles, a slimmer bill, and different vocalisations. The female Eurasian blackbird is similar in size and plumage to a jackbird, but is more wary, and has a shorter beak and quite different body shape and posture.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>South Island saddlebacks originally occurred throughout the South and Stewart Islands. Predation by introduced mammals (mainly ship rats) led to their extinction on the South Island and Stewart Island by about 1900, and they became confined to the South Cape Islands (Big South Cape, Solomon and Pukeweka Islands), muttonbird islands off the south-west coast of Stewart Island. When ship rats invaded all three islands in the early 1960s, the Wildlife Service (which subsequently became part of the Department of Conservation) successfully moved birds from Big South Cape Island to nearby Big and Kaimohu Islands in 1964, thereby averting extinction of the South Island saddleback. Subsequent successful or ongoing translocations have been made to Betsy Island (1969), Womens Island (1972), North Island (north-east of Stewart Island; 1972); Putauhinu Island (1974, 1976, 1984), Kundy Island (1978), Edwards/Motunui Island (1981), Jacky Lee Island (1986), Breaksea Island, Fiordland (1992), Motuara Island, Queen Charlotte Sound (1994), Pohowaitai Island (1999), Ulva Island (2000), South Passage Island, Chalky Inlet (2001), Anchor Island, Dusky Sound (2002, 2004), Long Island, Queen Charlotte Sound (2005), Chalky Island, Fiordland&#xA0;(2008), Blumine Island, Queen Charlotte Sound&#xA0;(2009-10), Orokonui Ecosanctuary (2009, 2012), Big South Cape (2011-12, following 2006 rat eradication), Big Moggy Island (2011), Little Moggy Island (2012), and Solomon Island (2012). All islands are off the coast of Stewart Island, unless stated otherwise.The only mainland population is&#xA0;at Orokonui Ecosanctuary near Dunedin.</p>\n<p>Saddlebacks are most common in coastal forest and regenerating native forest, and occur at lower densities in mature tall native forest.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The most recent population estimate for South Island saddlebacks was 1265 individuals in 2003, but the population is now likely to exceed 2000 birds. Saddlebacks were historically widespread and abundant, but are now locally common only on offshore islands where introduced predators, especially ship rats and stoats, are absent.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>South Island saddlebacks are extremely vulnerable to introduced mammalian predators such as ship rats and stoats due to their tendency to nest, forage and roost on or low to the ground. As a result, they are confined to sites where introduced predators are absent, primarily on offshore islands. Because of the increase in number of secure island populations, the species is now listed by the Department of Conservation as At Risk/Recovering.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The female South Island saddleback builds a cup-shaped nest only in the morning, usually in cavities of mature native trees such as southern rata. Nests may also be built in cavities under banks, in overturned roots of trees,&#xA0;inside derelict buildings, in the crown of tree-ferns, or in dense epiphytes and shrubs. Females appear to select cavities with properties that reduce thermal variation. Two pale eggs with light brown spots are incubated by the female only, for about 20 days. Both adults provision nestlings for the 25-27 days they are in the nest, and continue to feed them after fledging. South Island saddlebacks can breed during their first year, but typically do so only in low density populations.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>South Island saddlebacks form long-term, monogamous pair-bonds and usually occupy the same territory for their entire lives. Pair-bonds are maintained by &#x2018;bow-fan-warble&#x2019; and &#x2018;archangel&#x2019; wing displays, as well as courtship feeding. Saddlebacks are poor fliers, and pairs are often seen noisily foraging together on the forest floor or quickly bounding between branches. Young, non-territorial individuals in high-density populations tend to forage together in small flocks of 2 to 4 individuals. Saddlebacks are frequently joined by other species, particularly&#xA0;yellowheads, native parakeets, brown creepers and fantails, to form multi-species feeding flocks during the non-breeding season. Throughout the year, fantails are often seen foraging alongside South Island saddlebacks, gleaning invertebrates that have been disturbed by the vigorously foraging saddlebacks.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>South Island saddlebacks mainly forage on or low to the ground, and males tend to spend more time on the ground than females. Both sexes feed predominantly on invertebrates, using their long, sharp bill to pick through and toss aside leaf litter, pry apart and probe trees and rotting wood, and strip bark off of trees and tree-ferns. They also take fruit and nectar.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddleback_(bird)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddleback_(bird)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nationalredlist.org/files/2012/09/THREATENED-SPECIES-RECOVERY-PLAN-SERIES-NO.11.pdf\">http://www.nationalredlist.org/files/2012/09/THREATENED-SPECIES-RECOVERY-PLAN-SERIES-NO.11.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996 (rev 2000). <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It was a striking large songbird, mainly black with long white-tipped tail feathers. Female and male huia had dramatically different bill sizes and shapes; this was the most extreme sexual bill dimorphism of any bird species. A fleshy orange wattle hung at the base of each side of the bill, and was often held pressed under the chin. Maori named the bird after its loud distress call, described as &quot;a smooth, unslurred whistle rendered as <em>uia, uia, uia </em>or <em>where are you</em>?&quot; The last accepted sighting was in 1907, but it is likely that a few huia persisted into the 1920s.</p>\n<p>New Zealand wattlebirds are crow- or starling-like songbirds. Genetic comparisons suggests that they shared a common ancestor with the satinbirds, berrypeckers and longbills of New Guinea. Together they form the New Zealand endemic bird family Callaeidae, comprising North and South Island species of kokako and saddleback (tieke), and the now extinct huia. All have (or had) rounded wings, limited powers of sustained flight, and use bounds, hops and jumps to move around forests.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The huia was a magpie-sized glossy black bird. In fresh plumage, the black feathers had a green and bluish-purple metallic sheen. The long black tail feathers had 2-3 cm white-tips, forming a bold white band across the tail-tip. The bill was pale ivory grading to bluish-grey at the base, and yellow at the gape. The female&apos;s long, slender, decurved bill was 85-104 mm long; the male&apos;s heavier, less-curved bill was 54-60 mm long. A bright orange or yellowish oval fleshy wattle up to 24 mm by 16 mm was attached at the base of each side of the bill, and was often held curled under the bill. The long legs were bluish-grey. Juveniles were brownish-black with an off-white tail band, becoming whiter with age, and white fleshy wattles becoming orange with age.</p>\n<p>Voice: various melodious and flute-like calls, audible up to 400 m away.</p>\n<p>Similar species: both saddleback species resemble dwarf versions of the male huia, but with red wattles and rufous brown &quot;saddle&quot; markings on the back.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Pre-human huia bone remains indicate it was common throughout the North Island, but absent from the South Island. Huia were widespread but sparse after European settlement, in the eastern North Island from Huiarau south, with most records from the Ruahine, Tararua and Rimutaka ranges and northern Wairarapa, also the hills around Wellington.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Genetic study indicates huia had &quot;moderate to high&quot; historical population of 34,000 to 89,000 birds; probably higher pre-human settlement.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Predation by introduced mammals and, to a lesser extent, human hunting, was the likely cause of huia extinction. Large areas of native forest containing huia were&#xA0;logged or burned in the 1800s to make way&#xA0;for farming, but this would have caused a&#xA0;modest range reduction rather than being a major contributor to their extinction. Maori traditionally prized and wore huia tail feathers as a mark of status. Tail feathers became fashionable in Britain after the Duke of York was photographed wearing one during a 1901 visit to New Zealand. Overseas bird collectors and museums bought mounted specimens and tail feathers. Austrian naturalist Andreas Reischek took 212 pairs between 1877 and 1889. New Zealand naturalist Walter Buller recorded that 11 Maori hunters took 646 huia skins from forest between Manawatu Gorge and Akitio during one month in 1863. Gilbert Mair recorded eating &quot;<em>a splendid stew of Huia, Kaka, Pigeons &amp; Bacon</em>&quot; with Buller at a bush camp in Wairarapa, October 1883, after shooting 16 huia and capturing live birds. Thousands of huia were exported overseas. Protection measures enacted in the 1890s were poorly enforced. Two male birds kept at London Zoo in the 1880s died in captivity. Plans to transfer huia to Kapiti and Little Barrier island reserves never eventuated. A pair captured in 1893 for transfer to Little Barrier was acquired by Walter Buller and apparently sent to&#xA0;Baron Walter Rothschild in England.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>A captive pair kept by Buller hopped from branch to branch, fanning their tails, and caressing bills while making low twittering contact calls. This was thought to be a courtship display. Male huia fed females during courtship, incubation and brooding, as do kokako and saddleback. Huia bred as monogamous pairs during September-February. The large saucer-like nest with cup-shaped centre had thick walls of woven grass, leaves and stems. The 2-4 stone-grey eggs with purplish-brown markings were laid in September-October. Incubation was mainly by the female. One brood of 2-3 nestlings was reared, mainly in November. Young remained in the family group, fed by both adults, for at least three months. There is also an unconfirmed record of a nest &quot;<em>in a rotten maitai tree, about fifteen feet from the ground&quot;</em> containing four eggs &quot;<em>laid in the rotten dust</em>&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Male huia used their bills as a &quot;pick-axe&quot; to dig into decaying wood, exposing and extracting huhu larvae and other insects. Females probed deeper using their longer, more decurved bill to extract larvae from more solid wood. Buller observed male-to-female transfer of food, but never in the other direction; he also described a pair apparently co-operating to hunt weta. Riley quoted Caldwell: <em>&quot;He hops along with a fine spider and very politely offers it to his better half, who seems to always appreciate his fine attention. And so they keep close together .... the female, with her slender bill, often getting a fine, fat insect, which, however, she does not give to her mate&quot;. </em>Oliver quoted Wright: <em>&quot;I have watched them in pairs hunting for wetas. The male would tear away the outer part of a green sapling. The female then tried to retrieve the weta with her long slender bill. If not successful she would stand back while the male tried to enlarge the hole. Unless the tree was a maire the birds would generally succeed, and would then fly away with the weta&quot;. </em>Different bills may have allowed pairs to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats, increasing the amount of food they extracted from a territory.</p>\n<p>Huia were &quot;ecologically naive&quot;, with little fear of humans. They seldom flew above tree-height, moving through the forest by hopping or bounding along branches and on the ground, similar to kokako, and were reputedly able to jump &quot;twenty feet&quot; at a time. Potts described huia, &quot;<em>bounding with a slight opening motion of the wings, flying only very short distances</em>&quot;. They were reportedly the first bird to call in the &quot;early dawn&quot;. The calls of the sexes differed. Duetting pairs repeatedly called alternately, answering one another; they called with their bill pointed 30-45 degrees from vertical.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Huia mainly consumed wood-dwelling insects and their larvae, including huhu, weta, mantis, butterfly, also spiders, taken from decaying wood, bark, lichen, moss, ferns and the ground. They also ate native forest fruits, including hinau, pigeonwood, <em>Coprosma</em>, and kahikatea, and &quot;<em>vegetable matter</em>&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huia\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huia</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=6260\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=6260</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Barker, F.K.; Cibois, A.; Schikler, P.; Feinstein, J; Cracraft, J. 2004.

However, thanks to successful conservation management and research, the stitchbird is now one of the better studied New Zealand bird species, and can be seen at several accessible translocation sites. Stitchbirds are often curious, approaching people for close examination whilst emitting warning calls; yet the calls&#x2019; high pitch, and the bird&#x2019;s rapid movements and colouration can make them hard to detect. Until 2006 the stitchbird was considered to be a honeyeater (Family Meliphagidae), which includes tui and bellbird and c.100 other Australasian and Pacific species. However, genetic studies showed that the stitchbird belongs to a family of its own (Notiomystidae), closest to the New Zealand wattlebirds (Callaeidae, comprising huia, kokako and saddlebacks). The stitchbird has a complex and unusual breeding system that includes pair and group nesting as well as promiscuity. They use a variety of mating positions and strategies that, when considered together, are unique&#xA0;in the bird world.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Stitchbirds are medium-sized songbirds recognisable by wren-like cocked tail, bold white wing-bar and fast movements in mid canopy. Males have a black head with white ear tufts, yellow neck and shoulder band, white wing-bar and greyish-brown body. Females are greyish-brown apart from the white wing bar. Juveniles resemble females. The blackish bill is slender and down-curved, resembling that of a honeyeater (e.g. bellbird).</p>\n<p>Voice: male stitchbirds emit many variants of a whistle call with 2-3 notes (females may include some of these sounds in their warble). Both sexes produce a single note <em>titch</em> warning call, single-note high-pitched whistles, a quiet warble; short identification or aggressive warbles; and a repetitive single-note alarm call similar to bellbird&#x2019;s. Females emit a loud single repetitive and fast alarm call when chased by males during the breeding season.</p>\n<p>Similar species: female stitchbirds can be confused with female bellbird, which are greenish rather than greyish-brown, have a white line on the cheek and lack white wing patches. Bellbirds are also slimmer than stitchbirds, do not cock their tails, and have slower movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Stitchbirds originally occurred throughout the North Island plus Great Barrier, Little Barrier and Kapiti Islands. They were first&#xA0;reported from the Bay of Islands in 1835, but by the 1870s they had disappeared from the mainland north of the Waikato. The last mainland sighting was in the Tararua Range in 1883, after which stitchbirds were confined to Little Barrier Island. Attempts to translocate them to Hen Island (1980-81), Cuvier Island (1982 &amp; 1985), Mokoia Island (1994) and Waitakere ranges (2007-08) were unsuccessful. Stitchbirds have been translocated with more success to Kapiti Island (1983-84, 1990-92, 2002), Tiritiri Matangi Island (1995-96, 2001, 2010), Karori Sanctuary (Zealandia; 2005-06, 2008, 2010),&#xA0;Maungatautari (2009-11) and Bushy Park (2013). Stitchbirds inhabit mature native forest, or can be maintained by supplementary feeding in seral habitats, which is currently required at all release sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population is unlikely to exceed 2000 birds, although the Little Barrier population alone was estimated to peak at 6000 birds following cat eradication there in 1980.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The extirpation of stitchbirds throughout the North Island and on Kapiti and Great Barrier Islands was probably due to predation by introduced rats and, possibly, introduced diseases. Their disappearance was too early for introduced stoats to have been a factor. Since 1980 the main conservation method attempted has been translocation to sites where mammalian predators have been eradicated or controlled to low densities, followed by supplementary feeding due to poor habitat quality at release sites. The conservation status of this species was moved from nationally endangered to nationally vulnerable in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Stitchbirds breed in spring and summer. They construct a deep woven cup lined with tree fern scales and feathers, on top of a stick base inside a natural tree cavity or nest box. Up to four clutches of 1-5 (average 3) eggs can be laid per season, with clutch size decreasing with later breeding attempts. Females incubate alone, but males assist with chick rearing.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Stitchbirds have a complex social structure that includes a variable mating system and a multitude of interactions between the members of a population. For example, several males and females have been reported visiting others nests; chicks from various nests get together in cr&#xE8;ches after fledging and perform behaviours that have been interpreted as play; adult males form groups with juveniles during the winter time where perhaps hierarchies are being formed. Our knowledge of such structure is only in its infancy and research is needed to understand it. Variable mating systems are unusual among birds with only six passerines in addition to&#xA0;stitchbird having been reported as polygynandrous (i.e. multiple male partners and multiple female partners occur; also recorded in dunnock (<em>Prunella modularis</em>); alpine accentor (<em>P. collaris</em>); Smith&#x2019;s longspur (<em>Calcartus pictus</em>); superb fairy wren (<em>Malurus cynareus</em>); aquatic warbler (<em>Acrocephalus paludicola</em>); and red-billed buffalo weaver( <em>Bubalornis niger</em>)).</p>\n<p>The stitchbird&#x2019;s unusual mating system means that males copulate with more than one female, and compete for copulations with other males. To support such activity, male stitchbirds have testicles four times larger than expected by body size, and produce a large amount of sperm. At the peak of the breeding season, stitchbird males&#x2019; cloacal protuberance (where birds store sperm) is three times the expected size for a bird its size.</p>\n<p>Stitchbirds copulate in two different positions: the common male-on-female&#x2019;s back, and face-to-face, with the female on her back on the ground, a position no other bird so far is known to use. In addition to storing sperm, the engorged cloacal protuberance in stitchbirds changes the angle of the cloaca, allowing successful contact with the female&#x2019;s cloaca during face-to-face copulation. Face-to-face copulations are considered forced (i.e. &#x2018;rape&#x2019;), and are mostly carried out by extrapair males. Of 105 copulations observed on Tiritiri Matangi,&#xA0;34 (32%) were face-to-face, with only&#xA0;five the male partner.</p>\n<p>Stitchbird translocations to various island and mainland sites have not yet resulted in self-sustaining populations. Fungal infections with <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>, a fungus that grows best in disturbed habitats such as those in regenerating bush, and not enough food have been identified as reasons for failure in establishing translocated populations. Currently supplementary feeding is the main management strategy used to support stitchbird translocations, with nesting boxes provided at sites with early stages of regeneration.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Stitchbirds feed on invertebrates, fruits and nectar.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hihiconservation.com/\">http://www.hihiconservation.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitchbird\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitchbird</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/stitchbird/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/stitchbird/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/hihi.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/hihi.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Alley, M.R.; Castro, I.; Hunter, J.E.B. 1999.

In silhouette it looks like a small pied stilt. It breeds across central Asia and migrates to Africa&#xA0;and Australia. The marsh sandpiper is a regular visitor to New Zealand in very small numbers, usually singly with perhaps only one or two per year, although six were seen together at Miranda in 1998. Individuals often stay for extended periods.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Marsh sandpipers have relatively small bodies but their very long greenish legs and&#xA0;long fine straight bill make this species distinctive. In flight their dark wings without wing bars and a long white back and rump and a pale tail are also diagnostic although greenshank has similar markings but is considerably larger. They are generally grey above and white below in non-breeding plumage, with a small white eyebrow. In breeding plumage they are more streaked on the head, neck, back and breast. </p>\n<p>Voice: when flushed, marsh sandpipers give a rapidly repeated loud &#x2018;yip&#x2019; or a &#x2018;plew&#x2019;, similar to greenshank but higher pitched.</p>\n<p>Similar species: in New Zealand, greenshank, which is considerably larger at 32 cm and 170 g, has a much heavier bill. Lesser yellowlegs is similar in size and structure but lacks the white back and has yellow legs. Juvenile pied stilts are darker on the back, with each feather fringed with buff; their attentive parents also remove confusion, although marsh sandpipers often associate with pied stilts.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Marsh sandpipers breed eastwards to Mongolia across central Asia, and&#xA0;formally bred in eastern Europe. After breeding they migrate to sub-Saharan Africa, India, parts of Southeast Asia and scattered coastal and inland locations in Australia. In New Zealand they are rarely seen away from the coast but prefer shallow freshwater or brackish lakes and pools rather than open mudflats. Marsh sandpipers are usually found with pied stilts in New Zealand and have been recorded at suitable sites from Northland to Southland, and occasionally on Chatham Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The estimated global population of marsh sandpipers is 260,000 - 1.2 million birds. As this species is very widespread, particularly in the non-breeding season, accurate counts are difficult to obtain. Numbers are probably decreasing, but the decline does not appear to be sufficiently rapid to be of immediate concern, hence it is classed as of Least Concern by IUCN.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Marsh sandpipers no longer breed in eastern Europe, Belarus, Moldova and western Russia due to agricultural intensification on the steppe habitat. Egg collecting may also have had an impact. High levels of pollutants have been recorded in their eggs in the Lake Baikal region of Russia. Staging habitat loss due to reclamation around the Yellow and Bohai Seas is a serious issue for this species on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, as is unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna and increasing pollution.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Marsh sandpipers breed around inland wetlands from boreal forest to open steppe, including shallow freshwater and brackish marshlands, river valleys, flooded meadows and occasionally salt-lakes. The nest is a shallow depression often on a mound at the edge of a lagoon or pool. It usually nests solitarily or in small colonies with pairs sometimes nesting less than 10 m apart. As with most sandpipers, chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and feed themselves on insects and other small invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The marsh sandpiper is a medium to long distant migrant travelling overland in broad fronts between its breeding grounds and non-breeding grounds in sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia, Indonesia and Australia. On the East Asian-Australasian Flyway this species passes through Mongolia, north-eastern and coastal China, Korea and Japan, to winter in Southeast Asia and Australia. Most pre-breeders stay on the non-breeding grounds or at intermediate sites during the breeding season. They often forage singly or in small groups although large flocks have been recorded in parts of coastal China, particularly the Bohai Sea during northward migration.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Marsh sandpipers eat terrestrial and aquatic insects, small crustaceans, molluscs and fish.

It is a rare vagrant to New Zealand with fewer than 20 records, the last being in 2004. Lesser yellowlegs breed in North America and migrate to Central and South America and are found in many types of wetlands.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The lesser yellowlegs is a medium-sized long-legged, slender wader. In breeding plumage the upperparts are mottled grey-brown, white, and black, and the underparts are white with brown streaking on the neck and breast and blackish barring on the flanks. In non-breeding plumage, the upperparts are uniform grey-brown with pale spots, and the underparts are white with fine streaking on the neck and breast. The plain grey-brown upperwings and back contrast with the white rump in flight. The bill is slender, dark and about the length of the head. The sexes are alike.</p>\n<p>Voice: a whistled <em>tew-tew</em> or <em>tu-tu</em>, similar to greater yellowlegs.</p>\n<p>Similar species: In New Zealand the closest species in size and general appearance is the marsh sandpiper, which has greenish legs and a white V extending up the back in flight. Wilson&#x2019;s phalarope has shorter legs, an unusual pot-bellied physique, and has a bolder white eyebrow contrasting with a dark stripe through the eye. Other similar species have not been recorded in New Zealand, including greater yellowlegs (<em>T. melanoleuca</em>), which is 25-30% longer and has a thicker base to the bill, which is about 1.5 times the head length. Solitary sandpiper (<em>T. solitaria</em>) is darker above with greenish legs. Wood sandpiper (<em>T. glareola</em>) has greenish or brownish-yellow legs and a high-pitched call.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Lesser yellowlegs breed in marshy, boggy habitat known as muskeg, across North America from Alaska to Hudson and James Bay in Canada. In the non-breeding season they are found from southern USA, right through Central America and across most of South America. They use a wide range of wetland habitats from coasts to mountains. The lesser yellowlegs is a rare vagrant to Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The identity of the first yellowlegs recorded in New Zealand (lesser vs greater), at Porirua Harbour in November 1962, was much debated before it was accepted as a lesser yellowlegs. This is supported by the subsequent records of at least 17 lesser yellowlegs with, as yet, none of the larger species. Most records are from coastal wetlands around harbours and estuaries from Manukau Harbour south to Washdyke and Wainono lagoons. There are two inland records (Lake Pukepuke, March-April 1974; Wanstead lagoon, Waipukurau, January 2004) and one from Te Whanga Lagoon, Chatham Island (November 1985). A few favoured locations have been visited on multiple occasions: Ahuriri Estuary, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay (November 1963, April 1973, February 1983, January 1994), Wainono (February-March 1972, November 1987) Manukau Harbour (October 1973 - March 1974, October-November 1987), Farewell Spit (March 1974, January 1977). Other accepted sightings have been at Porirua Harbour (November 1962), Lake Ellesmere (January 1964), Washdyke Lagoon (February 1971), Lake Wairarapa (January 1983), and the Avon-Heathcote Estuary (October 2002). All New Zealand records have been of single birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The global population of lesser yellowlegs is estimated at 500,000 birds and is known to be declining, although not at a fast enough rate to be of immediate concern. It is classed as of Least Concern by IUCN.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Lesser yellowlegs are safe from habitat loss during breeding as they breed in areas with low human population. They are also more secure than many wader species when on migration and on non-breeding grounds, as they use a wide range of habitats across a vast range, and are not concentrated at key staging sites during migration.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Lesser yellowlegs breed May to August, tending to nest in loose colonies in open boreal forest with scattered muskeg. The clutch size is usually 4. Chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and feed themselves on insects and insect larvae.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The lesser yellowlegs is a middle to long distant migrant within the Americas and it is unclear which route vagrants take to reach New Zealand but possibly via Asia, as it is a vagrant in Siberia and Japan. However, it is also a rare vagrant to Hawaii and French Polynesia so an oceanic route can&#x2019;t be ruled out.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Lesser yellowlegs mainly eat aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, particularly flies and beetles and occasionally small fish and seeds.

No other small wader has a long up-curved bill, and few have bright yellow or orange legs. The few Terek sandpipers that reach New Zealand often associate with wrybills. These small plovers are typically very accepting of close observation, which makes it easy to get a good look at a Terek sandpiper, as they adopt the calm demeanour of the surrounding flock. The name &#x2018;Terek&#x2019; is from the Terek River in the northern Caucasus, which flows through Georgia and Russia into the Caspian Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Terek sandpiper is a small grey-brown wader with short, conspicuously yellow or orange legs, and a long upturned bill.

Red-necked avocet has a very obvious upturned bill but it is much larger, and black-and-white with a reddish brown head.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Terek sandpiper breeds in the boreal taiga zone of Eurasia, from Russia to the Russian Far East. In the non-breeding season, they are widespread on coasts throughout much of Africa, Arabia, southern India, South-east Asia, Indonesia and northern and eastern Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The population of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is estimated at 50,000 (Wetlands International 2012). It is unclear how many Terek sandpipers now reach New Zealand. They were regular visitors in low numbers through to the 1980s, with up to eight at a time occurring at favoured sites (especially Kaipara Harbour, Miranda and the Manukau Harbour). As they were regularly present and easy to identifiy, bird watchers tended to take them for granted, and rely on biannual wader counts to monitor their numbers, rather than submitting sightings to the OSNZ Rare Birds Committee (now Records Appraisal Committee). Terek sandpipers are now a much rarer bird in New Zealand, and probably no longer reach New Zealand every year. They have been found from Northland to Southland, usually among flocks of wrybills or other small waders.

Its stout body, short powerful legs and feet, and robust wedge-shaped bill allow it to turn over large shells, stones and flotsam, such as driftwood and seaweed, while foraging for sandhoppers and other crustaceans. An annual circumpolar breeder on Arctic and subarctic tundra, the ruddy turnstone is one of around 40 Arctic breeding wading bird species that migrate south and reach New Zealand. Its migration route is not fully understood. Some birds may fly south over the Pacific Ocean and some may fly along the East Asia-Australasian flyway. After spending the austral summer in New Zealand ruddy turnstones are thought to fly to the Korean Peninsula before flying on to Siberian breeding grounds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Recorded as far south as subantarctic Campbell Island (52&#xB0;S), the ruddy turnstone is the third most numerous Arctic migrant wader species that occurs in New Zealand. Breeding adults have brightly patterned black, white, rufous-brown or &quot;tortoiseshell&quot; plumage on the upperparts, which develops annually towards the end of the austral summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The ruddy turnstone is a distinctive medium-sized, stocky dotterel-like wading bird with a short bill, short neck and short orange-red legs. It has &apos;tortoiseshell&apos; plumage on the back, which is reddish-brown with blackish-brown patches on the back and upper wings, contrasting with the white underparts. The head, neck and breast are boldly pied black-and-white. A diamond-shaped white patch on the back and the white rump are prominent in flight. The short black-brown bill is wedge-shaped with a slightly upturned tip. In breeding plumage, males are slightly brighter than females. Non-breeding birds are markedly duller. Juveniles resemble non-breeding adults, but are browner with a paler head.</p>\n<p>Voice: turnstones most commonly give a repetitive clear staccato whistle, a short tremolo, or a short squeaky staccato chuckle. Also a sharp <em>kittick</em>, a clear <em>keeu</em>, a twittering <em>kititit, </em>and a melodious <em>kewk, kee-oo </em>or <em>kuiti </em>in flight or when alarmed.</p>\n<p>Similar species: shore plover is smaller with solid black on the face (other than juveniles), a red bill with a black tip, duller orange legs, and plainer brown on the back.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The ruddy turnstone is a circumpolar annual breeder on Arctic and subarctic tundra, mainly north of 60&#xB0; N, making it one of the most northerly-breeding wader species. One bird was tracked in two consecutive years migrating from Alaska to Australia via the central Pacific and back to Siberia via the East Asian-Australasian flyway, each &apos;round trip&apos; a journey of 27,000 km. A bird banded in Invercargill has been recorded on southward migration through Broome in north-west Australia&#xA0;during September in three successive years. This, along with tracks of birds flying south to Australia via coastal China and Indonesia, indicates some birds migrate along the same route before continuing on to New Zealand. After spending the austral summer in New Zealand ruddy turnstones are thought to fly to the Korean Peninsula in north-east Asia before flying on to Siberian breeding grounds.</p>\n<p>Ruddy turnstones usually inhabit coastal areas, typically on rocky or stony shores, although sometimes on sandy beaches, salt marshes, mudflats, short grass and ploughed fields. Exceptionally they have been recorded on a braided river bed. Migration south is in August-September. Birds arrive in New Zealand during August-November and depart northwards during March-May, usually forming small flocks near the coast. They are widespread in New Zealand with regular sites in summer including Parengarenga, Rangaunu, Kaipara, Manukau and Tauranga Harbours, Waipu estuary, the Firth of Thames, Farewell Spit, Motueka estuary, Lake Grassmere, Kaikoura Peninsula, and coastal lagoons or estuaries in Southland. They are regularly recorded at Chatham Island and the Auckland Islands, and are vagrant on the Kermadec, Antipodes, Snares and Campbell Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of the ruddy turnstone is estimated to number 460,000 - 730,000 individuals, with 1,000 - 3,000 birds reaching New Zealand annually in summer. Between 70 and 500 overwinter in New Zealand, probably immature birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>As for most migratory waders that use the East Asian-Australasian flyway, the greatest threat to ruddy turnstones is reclamation and coastal development on the shores of the Yellow Sea destroying crucial staging habitat needed by birds on migration.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Ruddy turnstones breed in May-August in the Arctic, usually as solitary, monogamous pairs. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with vegetation. and the 4 eggs are incubated for 22 days, mainly by the female. The female departs a week or so later, leaving the male to guard the young until they fledge at 19 - 21 days. Immature birds usually remain in New Zealand for their first 18 months, and first breed at two years-old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Ruddy turnstones are gregarious, often in small flocks of 20-100 birds of the same species, or with banded dotterels. Foraging methods include turning stones, shells and debris, such as driftwood and seaweed, probing and digging into mud and sand with the bill, and pecking food from rocks. They are able to overturn quite large objects. Birds may join together to move objects too big for one bird to shift. Molluscs and crabs are opened by sharp downward blows of the bill. Large flocks form on migration. Despite the absence of webbing on the feet, turnstones swim well. Their flight is strong and direct, usually low, in close formation.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Ruddy turnstones eat insects, spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, worms, other invertebrates, and plant matter. They sometimes take small fish and tern eggs, and scavenge carrion and discarded food. One bird was recorded feeding on a beachcast human corpse in the UK.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3034\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3034</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J.

They have lobed toes that they use to swim, and they feed by spinning rapidly in a tight circle on the surface, stirring up small prey items that they feed on.

It usually breeds in coastal areas at lower elevations than the red-necked phalarope. After breeding, grey phalarope migrate to pelagic waters off the west coasts of Africa and South America, and inhabits upwelling zones where plankton is most abundant. It rarely reaches New Zealand where there are ten accepted records.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population is estimated to be 1 - 2 million birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Lake Wainono (June 1883, June 1987), Lake Ellesmere (1925), Hastings (July 1934), Kaituna, Bay of Plenty (June 1977), Manukau Harbour (July 1992), Inch Clutha Lagoon (July 1993), Ninety Mile Beach (July 2003), off Tolaga Bay (May 2004), and Farewell Spit (March 2005). The most recent sighting was of an adult bird in partial breeding plumage near Napier in July 2012, on a small pond behind the beach.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The nest is a shallow cup or scrape on the ground in sedges or tussock, lined with grass, stones, feathers and lichen. After 3-4 eggs are laid in June, the female abandons the male to search for another mate, if enough male birds are available. The male incubates eggs for 17 - 26 days and feeds the chicks for the first few days. Males may then leave the chicks to feed themselves, or may stay with them until they can fly, 16-18 days after hatching. After females finish laying they migrate south. Once the chicks can fly, they also migrate.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>On land, grey phalaropes feed rapidly like a sandpiper. Birds at sea have been seen following baleen whales and associating with beluga whales and walruses, and are sometimes seen pecking at the backs of whales. In the northern summer they associate with killer&#xA0;and beluga whales; in the southern summer, with sperm whales. A grey phalarope has been recorded standing on the back of a killer whale. The bird was shot and its stomach was found to contain lice of a rare species that lives in the skin of killer whales.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>At sea, grey phalaropes feed on plankton and small fish found at the surface, and parasitic lice pecked from the skin of whales. During the breeding season, they forage in and around shallow water, eating plant matter and invertebrates, such as insects, molluscs and crustaceans.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Phalarope\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Phalarope</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3065\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3065</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Alerstam, T. 1990. <em>Bird migration</em>.

They usually breed farther inland and at higher elevation than grey phalaropes. After breeding, red-necked phalaropes migrate to the Arabian Sea and seas off New Guinea and Indonesia, and Ecuador and Peru. On migration they are often seen on small pools near coasts, and are sometimes blown onshore by storms. There are 12 accepted records of red-necked phalaropes in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of red-necked phalaropes is estimated at 3.6-4.5 million birds, with 100,000-1 million along the East Asian-Australasian flyway.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Accepted New Zealand records include Lake Ellesmere (1929, December 2000, January 2002), Whanganui estuary (April 1935), Washdyke Lagoon (March 1961), Mangere sewage ponds (June 1985), Miranda (December 1996), Farewell Spit (November 2000, October 2002), Lake Grassmere, Marlborough (November 2002), and Ahuriri Estuary (June 2010). At least two birds were present at times at Lake Grassmere between May 2005 and January 2007. An inland record from Lake Wanaka was never submitted for verification.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Red-necked phalaropes usually nest as solitary pairs, sometimes in loose colonies. The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground or sparse vegetation close to water, lined with grass. Four brown eggs with dark brown blotches are laid in June. The female abandons the male to incubate alone for 17-21 days. If enough male birds are available, females may mate with several. Chicks hatch well developed and are able to leave the nest after drying, and feed themselves. The male leaves the young after about two weeks. Juveniles are able to fly well 20-22 days after hatching and also migrate south.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>At sea, sometimes associates with whales and northern sea ducks, which stir up food from the bottom while feeding.

They are unusual for their reversed sexual dimorphism and aberrant breeding systems (females are more colourful, and may leave&#xA0;two or more males to care for consecutive clutches), and in being highly aquatic.</p>\n<p>Female phalaropes compete for nesting territories, court males, and aggressively defend their nest and mate.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wilson&apos;s phalarope is the largest and most terrestrial of the phalaropes. Named after Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson, it is a tall wading bird that breeds on the open prairies of North America. It migrates to western and southern parts of inland South America to spend the non-breeding season. Unlike the other phalaropes it does not have fully lobed toes and spends little time at sea. When feeding in water, it spins around more rapidly than other phalaropes. It rarely reaches New Zealand, where there are&#xA0;four records.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Wilson&apos;s phalarope is a subtly-patterned wader identifiable by its small head, long legs and black, needle-like bill. In breeding plumage, the female has a striking broad black stripe running from the base of the bill, through the eye and down the neck, and chestnut-reddish markings on the neck, breast and back. The crown and back are grey, the underparts are white, and the legs are black. Breeding males have a white crown and throat, pale chestnut nape and mantle, and pale grey-brown back. A fine black line runs from the base of the bill to behind the eye. In non-breeding plumage, both sexes look alike: pale grey above and white below with white face and eye stripe, and distinctive bright yellow legs. Juvenile resembles non-breeding male with yellow legs, but with distinctive dark brown-black mantle and back, and buff scaling or striping on back and upper wing feathers.</p>\n<p>Voice: flight call a soft, moaning <em>wemf</em>, <em>vint </em>or <em>vimp</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: grey and red-necked phalaropes are similar but smaller, and have black eye patches in non-breeding plumage. Wilson&apos;s phalarope has a longer, thinner bill than both, and its toes are not fully lobed. Lesser yellowlegs and stilt sandpiper have more elegant physiques (not pot-bellied) and heavier bills.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Wilson&apos;s phalaropes mainly inhabit shallow freshwater prairie wetlands in northern USA and southern Canada during the April-July breeding season. After breeding, adult birds migrate west to staging areas on large lakes in Oregon and California to moult. Birds then continue migration south through Central America, July-October. During migration, birds feed and rest by shallow ponds, flooded fields and coastal mudflats. In South America, birds inhabit inland wetlands including shallow freshwater ponds and saline lakes. Vagrant birds have been recorded from Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia and Antarctica.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of Wilson&apos;s phalaropes is estimated to be 1,500,000 individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Wilson&apos;s phalaropes have been recorded in New Zealand on&#xA0;four occasions. The first was at Manawatu estuary in September 1983, two birds were at Lake Ellesmere between November 1983 and April 1984 (with both together in December-January), one was at Taharoa, Waikato in October 2004, and one was at Ahuriri estuary, Napier,&#xA0;November 2016 to January 2017. The non-breeding season is August-March, and these five birds were mainly in non-breeding plumage.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and Conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The very large global population appears to be increasing, hence IUCN Red List classifies it as Least Concern. Large areas of prairie breeding habitat have been destroyed through draining of marshes for farming. In response, breeding birds have moved westwards. Wilsons&apos;s phalaropes congregate at a small number of main staging areas during migration which puts birds at risk, hence protection of these lake sites is a conservation priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Wilson&apos;s phalaropes breed during April-July. Females arrive at prairie breeding grounds first, and compete for males as they arrive. Most pairs are monogamous, although some females mate with multiple males. Males build scrape nests lined with grass in vegetation near freshwater. Four pale buff eggs with brown spots are laid April-June; males incubates these for c.23 days, then briefly care for chicks alone. Young leave the nest within one day of hatching and then forage for their own food. Females leave the breeding grounds first; males follow once the young can fly.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In contrast to the marine grey and red-necked phalaropes, Wilson&apos;s phalarope relies more on foraging in shallow water, or on shore. It regularly associates with American avocets and black-necked stilts, and is markedly more active than other shoreline-foraging waders. It breeds further south than other phalarope species. One bird observed in Antarctica in 1968 is the southern-most record of any wading bird.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Wilson&apos;s phalaropes eat aquatic insects and small crustaceans, as well as brine shrimps and brine flies.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3063\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3063</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_Phalarope\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_Phalarope</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoBibliography\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996 (rev 2000). <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand.</em> Auckland, Viking.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Higgins, P.J.; Davies, S.J.J.F (eds). 1996. <em>Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic birds</em>.Vol. 3, snipe to pigeons.

They have reverse sexual dimorphism, with females larger and more colourful than males, and males undertaking all parental care. Denizens of densely-vegetated wetlands, painted snipe are rare birds in Australia, with a single record from New Zealand (Lake Ellesmere, 1986). They are nomadic in Australia, moving inland to breed on temporary wetlands following rain events, and retreating to coastal wetlands when the interior dries out.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The painted snipe is unmistakable if seen well. It is a medium-sized wader with a long (5 cm) drooping bill, and has unusual white markings on its otherwise dark upperparts. White feathers surround the eye and reach back to the ear coverts, forming an elongated white patch on the side of the head. White &#x2018;braces&#x2019; extend from the breast around the front of the wing, then curl down the back, separating the dark wings from the even darker nape, neck and upper breast. The head, neck and breast of the female is a deep maroon-brown, while that of the male is buffy brown lightly streaked with white. A buff stripe runs from the base of the bill over the crown. The wings are intricately patterned in olive, buff and black. The bill is pale horn, the eye large and dark, and the medium-length legs are greenish.

They are often seen in pairs probing busily for shellfish along beaches or in estuaries. Previously shot for food, variable oystercatchers probably reached low numbers before being protected in 1922, since when numbers have increased rapidly. They are long-lived, with some birds reaching 30+ years of age.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The existence of different colour morphs (black, intermediate or &#x2018;smudgy&#x2019;, and pied) caused early confusion, and they were variously thought to be different species, forms, or hybrids. This confusion was compounded by a cline in morphs, with the proportion of all-black birds increasing from north to south. The colour morphs inter-breed freely and are now all accepted as being a single species.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The variable oystercatcher is a large heavily-built shorebird. Adults have black upperparts, their underparts vary from all black, through a range of &#x2018;smudgy&#x2019; intermediate states to white. They have a conspicuous long bright orange bill (longer in females), and stout coral-pink legs. The iris is red and eye-ring orange. Downy chicks occur in two colour morphs; they have a black bill, pale-mid grey upper parts with black markings, and either grey or off-white underparts. First-year birds have a dark tip to the bill, browner dorsal plumage, and grey legs.</p>\n<p>Voice: variable oystercatchers are very vocal; loud piping is used in territorial interactions and when alarmed, and they have a loud flight call similar to other oystercatchers. Chicks are warned of danger with a sharp, loud &#x2018;chip&#x2019; or &#x2018;click&#x2019;.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the black and smudgy morphs are distinctive. Pied morph birds can be confused with South Island pied oystercatcher. If seen together, adult variable oystercatchers are noticeably larger, but first-year birds may be confused. The demarcation between black and white on the breast is generally sharper on South Island pied, and they have more white showing forward of the wing when folded, and a broader white wingbar in flight. The pied morph is similar to Chatham Island oystercatcher, but their ranges are not thought to overlap.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>Variable oystercatchers occur around most of the coastline of North, South, and Stewart Islands and their offshore islands. Strongholds are in Northland, Auckland, Coromandel Peninsula, Bay of Plenty, Greater Wellington, Nelson/Marlborough, and&#xA0;Fiordland. They occur&#xA0;at lower average densities on west coasts of the two main Islands, and have not been recorded from any outlying island groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Variable oystercatchers breed most commonly on sandy beaches, sand spits, and in dunes, but will use a wide variety of coastal habitat types, including shell banks, rocky shorelines, and less often gravel beaches. They forage in all these areas and also on inter-tidal mud-flats in estuaries, and on rock platforms. Variable oystercatchers are not usually seen far from the coast, but will forage in paddocks, and occasionally nest a short distance inland, usually on mown or grazed grassy areas or bare ground. A very few nest around lakes or a short distance up braided rivers.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There were about 2000 variable oystercatchers in the early 1970s, this&#xA0;had risen&#xA0;to about 4000 by the mid-1990s. There have been no nationwide surveys in recent years, but if the increase has continued at the same rate, the total population would now be 5000-6000. On the Northland east coast and on Coromandel Peninsula, the increase appears to be slowing, possibly as those areas approach carrying capacity. Population growth and delayed maturation mean there are many pre-breeders in the population, so the number of breeding birds is somewhat less than the total. Roughly two-thirds of the population is thought to be in the North Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Breeding success of variable oystercatchers is often low, with main causes of failure being predation of eggs or chicks by a range of mammalian and avian predators, flooding of nests by big tides, and disturbance resulting from human recreational use of the coast. Adults generally show high annual survival, but are occasionally killed by cats and stoats. No specific conservation measures are undertaken, but some birds on the east coast of the northern North Island benefit from protection programmes for New Zealand dotterels and fairy terns.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Variable oystercatchers breed in monogamous pairs, and defend territories vigorously against neighbours. Nests are normally simple scrapes in the sand, often with a marker of driftwood, vegetation, or flotsam. The 2-3 eggs are usually laid from October onwards (rarely September), and replaced if lost. Incubation is shared and takes about 28 days. Chicks fly at 6-7 weeks-old, and late chicks may not fledge until March. Chicks are vigorously defended by both parents, often well after fledging. In Northland and Auckland, most birds do not breed until they are 5 years or older.</p>\n<p>Adults show high fidelity to mate and site. Many breeding pairs remain on territory year-round, but some join flocks of pre-breeders for the autumn and early winter, typically at larger estuaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Variable oystercatchers are often highly aggressive towards people close to nests or chicks, dive-bombing (sometimes making contact) and screeching. They also undertake distraction displays on the ground in defence of eggs and chicks. On the North Island east coast, territories often overlap with those of New Zealand dotterels. There is normally little aggression, but there have been a few cases of nearby dotterel nests being taken over (usually after variable oystercatchers have lost their own nest), and a few birds have been seen killing small dotterel chicks.</p>\n<p>Unlike most shorebirds, variable oystercatchers feed their young. Small chicks often remain hidden under vegetation, rocks, etc, with parents bringing food; this probably reduces the risk of predation by gulls and harriers. As chicks grow, they gradually find more of their own food, but are often seen begging from parents well after fledging. Sibling rivalry is common; when hatching is asynchronous, there is often large variation in size of the chicks within a brood. Adults commonly false-brood to conceal the location of nest or chicks.</p>\n<p>In North Canterbury, a few mixed variable x South Island pied oystercatcher pairs produce viable offspring.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Variable oystercatchers eat a wide range of littoral invertebrates, including molluscs, crustaceans, and annelids. They favour bivalve molluscs (e.g. mussels, tuatua, cockles) when these are available; these are opened either by pushing the tip of the bill between shells and twisting, or by hammering. They occasionally take small fish. On grass, variable oystercatchers eat a range of terrestrial invertebrates, including earthworms. When foraging, they are sometimes accompanied by kleptoparasitic red-billed gulls.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Oystercatcher\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Oystercatcher</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Baker, A.J. 1973.

The conspicuous black and white plumage and long red bill make this a familiar species. It is found on most estuaries, with numbers greatest during the period December to July. Fewer birds remain in coastal areas during the rest of the year, with most of the population moving to inland South Island riverbeds and farmland to breed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species of pied oystercatchers occur throughout Europe, North and South America and Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The &#x2018;SIPO&#x2019; is one of two species of oystercatcher on the New Zealand mainland. Solidly built, it is a striking black-and-white wader with a long, stout red bill and thick pink legs. There is a sharp border on the lower breast between the black upperparts and white underparts. In flight there is a white wingbar, rump and lower back. The sexes are similar. Juveniles have a brownish tinge to their plumage, dusky red bill and dull pink legs.</p>\n<p>Voice: flight call a loud shrill &#x201C;kleep&#x201D;. Loud piping calls are given when defending breeding and feeding territories.</p>\n<p>Similar species: can be confused with pied morph of variable oystercatcher, but the latter has a smudgy border on the chest and in flight has less extent of white, also with smudgy edges to rump and lower back.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>SIPOs occur throughout New Zealand in most estuaries and harbours. They usually breed inland in the South Island, mainly east of the Southern Alps on riverbeds and farmland, but are also known to breed on high country grasslands, and in coastal areas adjacent to estuaries and lagoons. Breeding has been attempted in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and southern Wairarapa since the 1980s. SIPOs migrate to coastal areas of both the North and South Islands after breeding. They have occurred as vagrants in Australia, New Caledonia and Vanuatu, and on Lord Howe, Norfolk, Kermadec, Chatham, Snares, Auckland and Campbell Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Total population estimated at 49,000 birds in 1970-71, but numbers increased subsequently and estimated at 112,000 birds in 1983-1994. More recent counts indicate that the total may have increased over the next several years, but has since declined to the 1988 level.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>SIPOs have survived all the threats introduced to New Zealand during the past few centuries since the arrival of humans. These include the introduction of mammalian predators, hunting by humans (until 1940), and invasion of braided riverbed nesting areas by tall vegetation. Future abundance may now be threatened by land use changes in breeding areas, pollution of winter feeding areas, and increased disturbance to feeding and roosting birds at coastal sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>South Island pied oystercatcher breed in spring and summer. Nests are unlined scrapes on a mound or raised area of sand, gravel or soil with good visibility all around. Both members of the pair incubate the 1-3 eggs and care for the young. Incubation takes 24-28 days, and the young fledge 28-42 days after hatching. Most birds commence breeding&#xA0;when 3 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Oystercatchers are strong fliers and have highly ritualised displays. On the ground they undertake loud piping displays to warn off other oystercatchers from feeding and breeding areas. Banded birds from one inland area in South Canterbury left their breeding territories during December-January and moved to coastal areas from Otago to Northland, with most individuals returning to the same estuary year after year. The pair bond is not maintained outside of the breeding season, although most birds retain their partner from one breeding season to the next. Banding shows that about 89% of adults survive from one year to the next, and so the oldest birds would live for about 25 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>In coastal areas SIPOs feed mainly on molluscs and worms, and have a strongly developed behaviour for preying on bivalves; other prey in coastal areas include crustaceans, cnidarians and fish. On wet pasture in coastal areas they feed mainly on earthworms and beetle larvae. There are no detailed studies of their food on their inland breeding areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Oystercatcher\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Oystercatcher</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Baker, A.J. 1969.

It is usually found on margins of wetlands where there is close surrounding cover, both in freshwater and estuarine habitats. It is not as shy as most crake species. There is a single record of an Australian crake being found in New Zealand (in 1871), presumably after having been wind-blown across the Tasman Sea. Australian crakes have very similar behaviour to the two resident New Zealand crake species, the marsh crake and spotless crake.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian crake is a relatively small bird, similar in proportions to the two New Zealand crakes, but slightly larger. Its colouration is much like the marsh crake, with blue-grey cheeks, throat and breast, the crown, nape, back and upperwings are olive-brown streaked with black and finely spotted with white, and the belly is strongly barred black-and-white. It differs in having white undertail coverts, and in having an orange-red base to the olive green bill. The eyes are red and the legs olive-green. Juvenile birds have similar markings and colouration, but are plainer and duller with less contrast between pale and dark markings.</p>\n<p>Voice: a sharp, harsh metallic 2-note call. They also utter a high-pitched chatter.</p>\n<p>Similar species: marsh crake is smaller, has fewer white spots dorsally, and has the barring on the belly extending all the way to the undertail coverts (cf. the white undertail in Australian crake).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian crake is endemic to Australia. Its main strongholds are the Murray and Darling River systems and the river systems feeding Lake Eyre. Coastal areas of New South Wales and southern Queensland inland to the Great Dividing Range along with north-eastern Tasmania also have reasonable populations, and there are many smaller populations scattered around the edges of the continent.</p>\n<p>Australian crakes inhabit permanent wetlands during droughts; after heavy rains, large numbers move to flooded inland lakes in central Australia. Most birds inhabit freshwater wetlands, but estuarine habitats are used also, provided there is dense cover, e.g. mangroves, rushes, reeds, or thickets.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The only record of an Australian crake in New Zealand was a bird that was shot in the &#x2018;Province of Auckland&#x2019; and was presented to the Colonial Museum by Walter Buller in 1871. The specimen remains in Te Papa (NMNZ.OR.004205)<em>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Australian crakes are usually seen as singles, pairs or family groups, most often in early mornings or evenings. They walk at a slow steady stalking pace when foraging, twitching their tails as they walk. When running for cover, their tails are held erect. Australian crakes usually scurry for cover rather than fly, when threatened. Their flight is laboured with legs dangling when flying in short bursts, but they are capable flyers, moving longer distances at night.</p>\n<p>Australian crakes occasionally cross creeks and waterways by swimming and may dive and peck at underwater vegetation, but they generally wade water edges or shallows when foraging.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Seeds, molluscs, snails and insects are obtained by probing or gleaning from the ground or vegetation. Australian crakes will submerge their heads to pick food from underwater vegetation and are known to break up larger food items by smashing them against the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bartle, J.A.; Tennyson, A.J.D. 2009.

It is now agreed that the bird was a moorhen and thus it is placed in the genus <em>Gallinula</em>. This small (250 g), flightless species was present on both the North and South Islands, and was named from bones recovered from the famous Pyramid Valley swamp in North Canterbury.

In addition to its brilliant red frontal shield and deep violet breast plumage, the pukeko is interesting for having a complex social life. In many areas, pukeko live in permanent social groups and defend a shared territory that is used for both feeding and breeding. Social groups can have multiple breeding males and females, but all eggs are laid in a single nest and the group offspring are raised by all group members.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The pukeko is a large, conspicious rail found throughout New Zealand. The head, breast and throat are deep blue/violet, the back and wings are black, and the under-tail coverts are conspicuously white. The conical bright red bill is connected to a similarly coloured &#x2018;frontal shield&#x2019; ornament covering the forehead, the eyes are also red. The legs and feet are orange, with long, slim toes. Females are smaller than males, but similarly coloured. Juveniles are similar to adults but duller, with black eyes and black bill and shield that turn to red around 3 months of age.</p>\n<p>Voice: pukeko are very vocal with a variety of calls. Territorial &#x2018;crowing&#x2019; is the loudest and most frequently heard call. A variety of contact calls including &#x2018;&#x2019;n&#x2019;yip&#x2019;, &#x2018;hiccup&#x2019; and &#x2018;squawk&#x2019; are used between adults, and between adults and chicks. The defence call is a loud, shrill screech used when a harrier is nearby. A similar, but deeper and hoarser, call is made during aggressive interactions between individuals. A soft nasal drone is performed during copulation runs.</p>\n<p>Similar species: takahe are about twice the size (in weight) and flightless, with a green back and wing cover. Juveniles may be confused with the spotless crake which lacks a frontal shield and has a more slender bill. Rare vagrant dusky moorhen is more likely to be seen swimming, is not as upright as a pukeko, and is smaller and greyer with a yellow tip to the red bill, and a dark centre to the otherwise white undertail. The equally rare (in New Zealand) black-tailed native-hen is much smaller with a green-and-orange bill, white spots on the flanks and a longer tail that is black underneath.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Pukeko are found throughout New Zealand, although less common in drier regions. They are typically found near sheltered fresh or brackish water (e.g. vegetated swamps, streams or lagoons), especially adjacent to open grassy areas and pastures. Pukeko are regularly seen near roadside and drainage ditches and along the margins of scrub or forested areas, from sea level up to 2300 m. Pukeko are resident on Chatham and Pitt Islands (though scarce there in the presence of dense weka populations) and on Raoul Island in the Kermadec Islands. They have been recorded as vagrants on L&#x2019;Esperance Rock (Kermadec Islands, September 1988),&#xA0;Campbell Island (January 1947) and Snares Islands (April 2016).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Pukeko are very abundant and widespread, with high population densities in areas of the North Island and west coast of South Island. New Zealand&#x2019;s pukeko population was estimated to be &gt;600,000 birds in the 1980s.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and Economic Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Pukeko may be hunted under license in New Zealand. While many shot birds are not consumed, the pukeko is underrated as table fare. Their blue breast feathers are prized as fly-tying feathers and for use in Maori cloaks.</p>\n<p>In some areas, pukeko are considered an agricultural or garden pest, as they will pull-up and eat planted vegetables and crops. Pukeko caused much damage to tree planting programmes on Tiritiri Matangi and Mana Islands until the solution of planting seedlings inside plastic tube cloches was implemented. Large populations of pukeko may also cause minor damage to livestock paddocks by eating grasses and soiling water troughs. For these reasons, landowners and managers occasionally seek permission to cull pukeko, either by shooting or poisoning birds. The Department of Conservation has periodically controlled pukeko numbers at managed sites on Great Barrier Island to reduce their predation of brown teal ducklings. While pukeko will occasionally attack, kill and eat offspring of other bird species,&#xA0;they are not considered a regular predator.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Pukeko have a highly variable mating system. Birds may nest as monogamous pairs but can also form polyandrous, polygynandrous and, more rarely, polygynous groups. Any of these groups may also have non-breeding helpers. When multiple breeding females are present, all lay in the same nest, a phenomenom known as &#x201C;joint-laying&#x201D;. Clutch size is typically 4-6 eggs per females and when multiple females contribute to a single nest the total clutch size can be as high as 18 eggs. Incubation is predominantly by breeding males, with some assistance from breeding females. All group members contribute to chick care. Incubation begins midway through laying and lasts 23-27 days. Hatching is spread over several days, but is more synchronous than laying. Chicks begin leaving the nest after 4-5 days, but are fed by adults for c. 2 months. In the North Island, laying can occur in any month, with a peak in August to November. In the South Island, breeding normally takes place between September and January.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Pukeko are commonly seen foraging in paddocks and along roadsides. When disturbed, they prefer to run or hide rather than fly, but once airborne, they are capable fliers and can fly long distances (e.g. to offshore islands). Despite not having webbed feet, they are also strong swimmers.</p>\n<p>Pukeko are territorial, and aggressive interactions between birds from neighbouring groups are common. Such territorial interactions are noisy affairs and often involve several birds from each group. Aggressive interactions typically begin with ritualised posturing that emphasises the bird&#x2019;s size and also display the frontal shield ornament. Occasionally, aggressive interactions escalate to full on fights where individuals bite and kick one another. Territorial defence is typically performed by males.</p>\n<p>Adult pukeko have few natural predators. Juvenile birds are often targeted by swamp harriers, but adult birds will fight vigorously to defend their offspring. Pukeko have been observed attacking cats and stoats.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Pukeko are primarily vegetarian, but animal foods make up a small proportion of the diet. Most common foods are the stems, shoots, leaves and seeds of grasses (e.g. <em>Poa</em>, <em>Glyceria</em>, and <em>Anthoxanthum</em> spp.), sedges (e.g. <em>Carex </em>and <em>Scirpus</em> spp.), rushes (<em>Juncus </em>spp.), clover (<em>Trifolium </em>spp.) and bullrush (<em>Typha </em>spp.). They also eat garden vegetables and crop plants. Animal foods consist mostly of insects, spiders and earthworms however there are rare reports of pukeko taking larger prey such as frogs, lizards, fish and nestling birds. The bill is used to cut, rip or dig up plants which are typically held and manipulated in the foot (i.e. &#x2018;parrot style&#x2019;) as they are eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pukeko\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pukeko</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fishandgame.org.nz/taranaki/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/pukeko/\">https://fishandgame.org.nz/taranaki/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/new-zealand-game-bird-species/pukeko/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Carrol, A.L.K. 1966.

It was described in 1848 by the anatomist Richard Owen at the British Museum, based on bones collected near the Waingongoro River mouth, South Taranaki the previous year by Walter Mantell (1820-95). Owen coined the genus name <em>Notornis</em> (Greek for &#x2018;southern bird&#x2019;) for the specimens, which were assumed to be of an extinct species. This name, through twists of fate, was to be the inspiration for the names of both the journal of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand (<em>Notornis</em>) in 1950, and also for the magazine of the Society, which was called <em>Southern Bird</em> from 2000 to 2013.</p>\n<p>One year after Owen named the North Island bird, the scientific community was astounded by the discovery of what is now called the South Island takahe, at Dusky Sound, Fiordland. The skin was secured by Walter Mantell, no less, and was described by his father, Dr Gideon Mantell (1790-1852), at a meeting of the Zoological Society in London in 1850. Gideon Mantell&#x2019;s major claim to fame is as the discoverer of the world&#x2019;s first dinosaur &#x2013; Iguanodon &#x2013; in 1822. It is through the unlikely connection of the elder Mantell having a naturalist son based in New Zealand at the time of his death, that the world&#x2019;s first dinosaur fossil &#x2013; an Iguanodon tooth &#x2013; ended up in the collection of the Colonial Museum (now Te Papa).</p>\n<p>For the next 147 years, the South Island takahe was considered the living embodiment of the bones that Walter Mantell had found in Taranaki. This was, perhaps, a unique set of circumstances, where a living bird was called by a name (<em>Notornis mantelli</em>) originally assigned to fossil bones. The South Island takahe was to acquire further fame, as three further specimens only were secured before its apparent extinction in 1898, only for it to be sensationally rediscovered in the Murchison Mountains by Dr Geoffrey Orbell in November&#xA0;1948. This rediscovery thrust the Notornis into the international spotlight a mere 5 years after a fledgling Ornithological Society of New Zealand had published the first issue of its journal under the name <em>N.Z. Bird Notes</em>. A resolution to change the journal name to <em>Notornis</em> was passed at the AGM in Wellington on 19 May 1949.</p>\n<p>New Zealand ornithologists continued to use the genus name <em>Notornis</em> through to 1990, and the North and South Island birds were regarded as being conspecific until the relationships of the two takahe were reviewed by Steve Trewick in 1996. It is only since then that the North Island takahe has been widely accepted as being a full species, distinct from the South Island takahe, with the northern bird still bearing Walter Mantell&#x2019;s name.</p>\n<p>As this tale unfolded, there was a subplot developing in the North Island. In the autumn of 1894, the surveyor Morgan Carkeek is reported to have caught an unfamiliar, large blue bird in the northern Ruahine Range. The skin was delivered to the home of Mr Roderick McDonald of Horowhenua, where it caused great excitement among older Maori, who recognised the bird as being &#x201C;the rarely seen Mohoau&#x201D;. The specimen (which no longer exists) is tentatively regarded as having been a North Island takahe, the only one known to have been seen by Europeans.</p>\n<p>Morphometric analyses of bones indicate that the North Island takahe was taller than its South Island counterpart, and was more similar in shape to a pukeko, though substantially larger at 3 kg (cf. about 1 kg for a pukeko).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution, habitat and threats</strong></p>\n<p>The North Island takahe occurred throughout the North Island. Fossil records indicate its former presence in Wairarapa, Hawke&apos;s Bay, Horowhenua, Taranaki, Waikato, Coromandel, Northland and the Far North. Palaeoecological evidence from sites where bones have been found (caves, swamps and dunes) indicate that North Island takahe inhabited grassland, scrub and forest, although data are few. Localities ranged in altitude from sea level to ~1000 m. North Island takahe bones have been found in seven midden deposits from South Taranaki and Manawatu, confirming that North Island takahe were captured and eaten by Maori. This is presumed to be the main cause of its extinction.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_takah%C4%93\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_takah%C4%93</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Mantell, G.A. 1851.

Four specimens were collected from Fiordland between 1849 and 1898, after which takah&#x113; were considered to be extinct until famously rediscovered in the Murchison Mountains, west of Lake Te Anau, in 1948. Until the 1980s, takah&#x113; were confined in the wild to the Murchison Mountains. They have since been translocated to seven islands and several mainland sites, making them more accessible to many New Zealanders. Conservation work by the Department Of Conservation and community groups aims to prevent extinction and restore takah&#x113; to sites throughout their original range. The success of DOC&#x2019;s Takah&#x113; Recovery Programme relies heavily on a partnership with Mitre 10 who through Mitre 10 Takah&#x113; Rescue is helping to ensure the long-term survival of this treasured species.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p>The South Island takah&#x113; is the largest living rail in the world. An enormous gallinule, it has deep blue on the head, neck and underparts, olive green on the wings and back, and a white undertail, The huge conical bill is bright red, paler towards the tip, and extends on to the forehead as a red frontal shield. The stout legs are red, with orange underneath. Juveniles are duller with a blackish-orange beak and dull pink-brown legs.</p>\n<p>Voice: the main calls of takah&#x113; are a loud shriek, a quiet hooting contact call, and a muted boom indicating alarm.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the extinct North Island takah&#x113; was taller and more slender. Pukeko can fly, and are smaller and more slender, with relatively longer legs, and black on the wings and back<em>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>South Island takah&#x113; originally occurred throughout the South Island. Hunting, predation and habitat loss resulted in a remnant population in the mountains of Fiordland. The modern conservation programme has set up additional populations; a captive breeding and rearing facility at Burwood Bush near Te Anau, plus free-ranging populations on wildlife reserves in the North and South Island and several offshore islands including Tiritiri Matangi and Motutapu (Hauraki Gulf), Kapiti and Mana (Wellington) and Maud (Marlborough Sounds).</p>\n<p>Takah&#x113; inhabit grasslands predominantly, using shrubs for shelter. In Fiordland, alpine tussock grasslands and the red tussock river flats are preferred. When winter snow covers these areas, birds move into adjacent beech forest. At other sites the vegetation is regenerating farm pasture in various stages of reversion to mixed native lowland forest. Some now have substantial forested areas. At these sites takah&#x113; prefer the grassland areas with scattered shrubs, although they do spend some time under forest.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The South Island takah&#x113; population in 2011-12 was approximately 276 birds, with ~110 in Fiordland, ~107 at restoration sites, 11 at captive display sites, and 48 at the captive breeding site.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Natural hazards influencing the Fiordland takah&#x113; population include avalanches and cold climate. Modern threats include predation by introduced stoats, and competition for food from introduced red deer. Deer numbers have been controlled to low levels since 1980, allowing tussock grasslands to slowly recover their original size and nutrients. Stoat predation impact is relatively low in most years but when environmental conditions conspire, stoat populations increase significantly, and have greater impact on takah&#x113; survival. The Fiordland takah&#x113; population is under a recently extended stoat trapping programme.</p>\n<p>From 1986 - 2009, takah&#x113; in Fiordland were managed by captive-rearing wild eggs, releasing yearlings back into the wild. Artificial incubation and puppet-rearing were used to maximise productivity. From 1986-1991, yearlings were released outside of the source population in an attempt to extend the range. From 1991-2009 there was a change to releasing among the source population which improved survival of released birds.</p>\n<p>Also, from 1984, captive-reared birds were used to establish breeding populations on predator-free offshore islands and predator-proofed mainland reserves. Now that the island/reserves population is well established, eggs for captive rearing are no longer removed from Fiordland. Since 2010, rather than augment the Fiordland population, captive-reared yearlings have been used to establish populations at new sites and expand the captive breeding population.</p>\n<p>Numbers on island/mainland reserves are managed by the removal of surplus young. This activity both limits population density to a suitable level and avoids inbreeding by mixing genetic lines between different sites. At the captive breeding facility, puppet rearing is redundant and artificial incubation is minimised. Instead, the enlarged breeding group is intensively managed through egg and chick fostering, ensuring each pair is laying, incubating good eggs or raising chicks. Genetic lines are managed to ensure none is over-represented.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Takah&#x113; in Fiordland lay late October-January. In the lower altitude sites nesting begins in September. One to three eggs (usually two) are laid two days apart; male and female share incubation and chick rearing equally. Eggs are pale buff colour with reddish-purplish blotches (c. 74 x 48 mm, and 95 g when fresh). Incubation takes 30 days, with chicks hatching two days apart. Chicks stay in the nest for about a week, as they become stronger they climb out and follow their parents begging for food. Chicks are brooded in the nest in cold or wet weather. Parents provide tussock shoots for the chicks with the tougher outer leaves peeled off. Parents move the family to access a fresh feeding area as soon as the chicks are able, repeating as necessary. If the first clutch fails, takah&#x113; may lay a second. They can lay a third in an intensively managed situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Takah&#x113; live in pairs or small family groups. Young stay with parents until just before the next breeding season, or stay for a second year. Unusual cases of breeding trios or greater (two females laying) have been observed. Pairs defend their breeding territory by calling, or fighting if necessary, returning to the same areas each year.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Fiordland takah&#x113; feed mainly on leaf bases of tussock grasses (<em>Chionochloa</em> spp). Sedges (<em>Uncinia</em> spp, <em>Carex coriacea)</em>, rushes<em> (Juncus</em> spp) and <em>Aciphylla</em> spp are sometimes taken. Smaller grasses are grazed from the tips down, this being the staple on islands and lowland reserves. When available, grass seeds are stripped from the stem while still attached. In Fiordland winter (forest) habitat, alternative carbohydrate is found by grubbing starchy rhizomes of a fern <em>Hypolepis millefolium</em> and the rhizomes of the sedge <em>Carex coriacea</em>. In other sites the diet does not vary as much seasonally - pasture grasses are available all year round. Takah&#x113; opportunistically take a protein in the form of large insects (moths, beetles, weta), or very rarely will take ducklings or lizards.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://takaherecovery.org.nz/\">Takah&#x113; Recovery website&#xA0;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/takahe/\">Department of Conservation&#x2019;s website, takah&#x113;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takah%C4%93\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takah%C4%93</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Grueber, C.E.; Maxwell, J.M.; Jamieson, I.G.&#xA0; 2012.

Coots are related to gallinules &#x2013; the branch of the rail family that includes pukeko and takahe. Out of the water, a coot&#x2019;s stance is more like a small pukeko than a duck. But instead of the pukeko&#x2019;s long thin toes, coots have broad fleshy lobes on their short toes, used to give propulsion when swimming. The Australian coot is a recent arrival in New Zealand, first recorded breeding here in 1958. Their colonisation partially fills the niche left vacant by the extinction of the New Zealand coot,&#xA0;which was widespread before the arrival of Maori.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Adult Australian coots are entirely slate-grey with a white bill and frontal shield. They have red eyes and large grey feet with lobed toes. Sexes are alike. Juvenile and immature birds have duller and paler colouring, with some pale grey on the chin and throat. They have brown eyes and smaller frontal shields. Coots are rarely seen in flight, where they differ from scaup in&#xA0;that their legs trail behind their tails&#xA0;in flight.</p>\n<p>Voice: a loud discordant <em>krark</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: New Zealand scaup have similar body size, shape, colouration and diving behaviour, but differ in having a blue-grey bill and no frontal shield, plus males have a yellow eye, and females often have white around the bill base (cf. blackish facial feathers in coots).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Australian coots are found throughout mainland New Zealand other than Northland, but there are few parts of the country where they are abundant. Coots are entirely aquatic, and there are large parts of the country that do not have their preferred freshwater lakes and ponds with submerged vegetation and reedy, grassy islands or edges.</p>\n<p>Single coots, possibly the same bird, have occurred as vagrants on Stewart Island (December 2012) and the Snares Islands (April 2013). Coots have reached Macquarie Island Island at least twice, with at least 7 birds in May-October 1957, and one in June-October 1975.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian coot is a subspecies of the Eurasian coot that self-introduced into New Zealand from Australia in the 20th century, and was first recorded breeding in New Zealand on Lake Hayes, Otago in 1958. There were about 2,000 coots estimated to be present in New Zealand in 2005.</p>\n<p>Coots reached New Zealand on many occasions before they established, with at least 9 records from the South Island between 1875 (Lovells Flat, Otago) and 1957 (Heathcote River, Christchurch), before the first eggs and chicks were seen at Lake Hayes in November 1958. The first North Island record was at Lake Tutira, Hawkes Bay in 1954. There was an influx of coots in or before 1957, and they rapidly established as a breeding species.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>As a self-introduced species, Australian coots are automatically covered by the Wildlife Act, and are fully protected. They are well-established in New Zealand, with no recognised threats.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian coot breeds between September and March and is very territorial during this time. They breed as monogamous pairs, often raising 2 broods per year.&#xA0; Three to 5 eggs, cream with dark spots, are laid in a floating nest of twigs and vegetation anchored to branches or reeds.&#xA0; Both sexes incubate the eggs for about 22 days, and older young help feed and raise the new offspring.&#xA0; The whole family group often remains together until the next spring.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Coots are the most aquatic members of the rail family, and are less secretive than most other rails. Although they do graze on short grass, they spend most of their time in the water, bobbing their heads as they swim and making short dives after a little forward jump. When alarmed they seek cover among emergent vegetation on the water rather than flying away. They appear to fly reluctantly from the water, pattering across the surface with a lot of splashing before finally taking off or settling in another area.&#xA0; However, they are strong fliers frequently covering large distances, usually at night. These flights and changes of location do not appear to be seasonal.&#xA0; Large flocks of coots may form after the breeding season.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Coots eat mainly vegetation &#x2013; seeds, algae, grass, leaves, shoots and fruit &#x2013; but also feed on invertebrates and occasionally, eggs. They will also take bread thrown to ducks.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/10\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wetland-birds/10</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Coot\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Coot</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Fleming, C.A.

They are gregarious and opportunistic, with large flocks sometimes gathering around cattle yards, slaughterhouses and refuse dumps where they scavenge for scraps. Black kites will also rob nestlings, steal food from other birds, as well as prey on small birds and insects. They are excellent soarers, and occasionally cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The black kite is a medium-sized dark brown hawk with longish rectangular, harrier-like wings, with pale brown across the shoulders. It has a long distinctly forked tail, and the legs and feet are short and weak. The soft parts including eyes are yellow. They are commonly seen gliding, soaring, or quartering the ground in search for food. Their flight is very distinctive and buoyant, the tail is continually opening, closing and flexing with the air-currents and when gliding, the carpal joint is often well forward with the wingtips slightly drooped.</p>\n<p>Voice: a high pitched quavering &#x201C;kwee-err&#x201D;; a staccato &#x201C;keee-ki-ki-ki&#x201D; including whistles and squeals.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the black kite is similar to the much more common swamp harrier. Unlike the harrier, the black kite does not soar with its wings held in a shallow V, but has a more flattened profile. It also lacks the harrier&#x2019;s distinctive pale rump and long legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Widespread and common throughout southern Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.&#xA0; </p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong> </p>\n<p>There are&#xA0;eight widely scattered records from both the North and South Islands: Renwick, Marlborough (1992-1994, and again 2000-15), Glentanner, Lake Pukaki (1994), Wanaka Airport (1996), various South Auckland localities (2001-2003), Pirinoa, Wairarapa (2002), Inglewood, Taranaki (2009), and near Mercer (2016-17). The single vagrant black kite seen near Renwick in 1992-94 is likely to be the same bird reported there in 2006. This bird was still present near Renwick in early 2015, having presumably been in the area some 23 years, roosting in a group of gums off the Waihopai Valley Road. This area of Marlborough has an open landscape and warm climate, similar to areas where these kites live overseas.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology </strong></p>\n<p>Black kites prefer open plains and countryside, in warm to dry, semi-arid to arid areas. They are typically gregarious, and are often seen in small to very large flocks. They are able to soar effortlessly to great heights. When walking, they appear to shuffle along on short legs with their tails held horizontally off the ground. In New Zealand, reports of the Renwick black kite indicate that the bird was quite sedentary. The decades-long presence of this bird shows that black kites can survive long-term in parts of the New Zealand landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>The black kite is a very opportunistic and successful hawk. Its diet is mainly carrion but it also includes human refuse, shellfish, fish, small mammals, reptiles, insects and birds. It will also steal food from other birds. In their native lands, they take advantage of rodent and insect plagues, as well as capturing small birds, mammals and insects fleeing from&#xA0;bush fires and agricultural burn-offs.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Kite\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Kite</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wingspan.co.nz/\">www.wingspan.co.nz</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cupper, J; Cupper, L. 1981. <em>Hawks in focus, a study of Australia&#x2019;s birds of prey</em>.

It is an opportunistic hunter that searches for food by slowly quartering the ground with its large wings held in a distinctive shallow V-shape. Adapted to hunt in open habitats, its numbers have benefitted from widespread forest clearance and the development of agriculture. Although carrion is a major component of the harrier&#x2019;s diet, it also actively hunts live prey such as small birds, mammals and insects. Capable dispersers, birds from New Zealand visit islands as far north as the Kermadec Islands and as far south as Campbell Island. Known for their dramatic &#x2018;sky-dancing&#x2019; courtship display the swamp harrier is the largest of the 16 species of harriers found worldwide.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Often seen perching on fence posts at the side of the road, swamp harriers are a large, long-legged bird of prey with sizeable taloned feet, prominent facial disks and a strongly hooked bill. Fledglings and juveniles have dark chocolate brown plumage all over, a whitish patch on the nape, brown eyes and a pale yellow cere, eye ring and legs. Although plumage is highly variable, adults generally have a tawny-brown back, a pale cream streaked breast and yellow eyes. They become paler with successive moults. Females are slightly larger than males. Harriers most often search for food low to the ground in a gently rocking glide interspersed with lazy wing beats. When gliding or soaring, their wings are set in a shallow V-shape with upturned fingered wing tips and an outspread tail. The cream/white rump is obvious in flight. They can hover clumsily for short periods. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: harriers mainly vocalise as part of their courtship displays during the breeding season. Their call is a series of same note, high-pitched, short, sharp &#x201C;kee-o kee-o.&#x201D; At other times of the year they are generally silent.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: sometimes confused with the New Zealand falcon. Falcons very rarely feed on carrion, are smaller and are more often seen in active chasing flight rather than the slow quartering flight typical of the harrier. Also the falcon lacks the obvious cream/pale rump of the harrier and glides with its wings set flat. Juvenile black-backed gulls are a similar size to harriers. However, young gulls have a stout, straight bill and are a more mottled greyish/brown colour. Gulls also have narrower angular wings that, unlike harriers they beat almost continually in traversing flight or set rigidly in a slightly downwards droop when soaring/gliding.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Swamp harriers occupy a wider ecological niche in New Zealand than elsewhere in Australasia. Abundant throughout most of New Zealand including the coastal fringe, estuaries, wetlands, pine forest, farmland and high-country areas. Less abundant over large tracts of forest and in urban areas. They are resident on the Chatham Islands, and often reach offshore islands as distant as the Snares, Auckland, Campbell and Kermadec Islands. Harriers are particularly abundant where plentiful food sources are available. They breed in wetlands, areas of long grass and scrubby vegetation. </p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Widespread and very common.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Harriers provide some level of control over introduced pests such as mice, rats and rabbits. They benefit farms and road users by clearing carcasses. However, they can take poultry and game birds where unprotected, and will also kill new-born lambs in some circumstances. They are partially protected, and it is legal to control individuals that are causing harm to property. At some sites, harriers are controlled to reduce the predation risk to endangered bird species. However, the effectiveness of control as a threatened species management technique or a method of reducing predation on poultry, game and lambs remains poorly understood. Harriers are susceptible to collision with cars and wind turbines.</p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Solitary breeders. Courtship displays start as early as June and continue through October. During displays both birds of a pair perform spectacular rocking dives, then swoop back up in a large U-shaped loop. A high-pitched <em>kee-o</em>, <em>kee-o</em> call is made during displays. These displays are often performed over the nest area. Eggs are laid between October-December. Incubation and brooding are undertaken by the female alone. Food is passed from male to female in dramatic aerial food-passes where the female turns upside down to take prey from the male. Bulky nests comprised of sticks are placed on the ground or on low bushes, in long grass, scrub or wetlands. Nests may be added to over multiple seasons. Harriers are sensitive to disturbance when nesting. </p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Their long legs enable them to catch prey by dropping down into the canopy of trees or long vegetation, legs outstretched and wings held back behind them. Wings are held in a shallow V-shape to allow birds to react to variable air currents while flying low to the ground. As a generalist predator they are universally harried by other birds especially magpies and spur-winged plovers. Harriers often circle up high on thermals, and are able to disperse great distances in this manner. Although partly migratory elsewhere in Australasia, they are not generally thought to be migratory in New Zealand. However, some local movements between breeding and wintering grounds, annual movements across Cook Strait and visits to offshore Islands as far away as the Kermadec Islands suggest some migratory behaviour may occur. During the breeding season they have a home-range of &#xA0;about 900 ha, may be far less in some habitats. In the non-breeding season harriers often form communal roosts which can contain several hundred birds.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Small to medium-sized birds and mammals, insects, lizards and frogs. Road-kill carrion can make up a large proportion of the diet e.g. possum, rabbit and hedgehog, especially during winter when other food sources are limited. Lamb carcasses and afterbirth, tadpoles, fledgling birds and crickets are taken when seasonally available. Cast pellets of undigested material. </p>\n<p class=\"MediumGrid21\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_Harrier\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_Harrier</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wingspan.co.nz/\">www.wingspan.co.nz</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The larger North Island form of Eyles&apos; harrier was approximately the size and weight of the smallest living golden eagle subspecies.

All but adults have prominent white windows on the underwing.</p>\n<p class=\"NoSpacing\">Voice: &#x2018;honk-honk-honk&#x2019; rapidly repeated, or loud and explosive &#x2018;ank-ank-ank&#x2019;. The calls are deep and basal, and somewhat goose-like.</p>\n<p class=\"NoSpacing\">Similar species: the swamp harrier&#x2019;s bill, legs and feet are noticeably slight in contrast to the robust features of the sea-eagle. The swamp harrier is far more delicate all round, having relatively narrow wings and a long square tail, in comparison to the deep rounded wings and wedge-shaped tail of the sea eagle. The swamp harrier also has a distinctive cream coloured rump which is absent in the seaeagle. Other large birds of prey that could potentially reach New Zealand that could be confused with the sea-eagle include the wedge-tailed eagle and the osprey.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Found around the coast, on rivers and lakes in Australia. Can venture some distance inland but not into the Australian interior. Occurs throughout most Indonesian Islands, south-east Asia, as far west as India and as far east as the Solomon Islands. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Considered a vagrant to New Zealand based on &#xA0;a specimen donated to Buller by Gould, which was apparently collected in New Zealand. There are several unconfirmed historical records mentioned in Oliver (1955), including Rakaia river (1866), Matukituki bush, Otago (1870), Wellington Harbour (1873), Tuarangakumu, Hawkes Bay (1935), and Nelson and Marlborough (1953). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Well-known for their ability to catch fish, white-bellied sea eagles generally enter a shallow dive from a high perch, until they are gliding close to the surface of the water; stalling, they plunge their talons into the water to grasp their prey. They then use powerful wing-beats to propel themselves upward and forward, often without entering the water at all. They will also plunge into water from soaring or from cumbersome hovering flights. Nests are a huge pile of sticks that are added to each year. These are situated near water, in large trees, on cliffs or sometimes on ground.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White-bellied sea eagle feed mainly on fish and sea-snakes but will also take young water birds, reptiles and mammals. They also pirate prey off other birds of prey and take some carrion.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-bellied_Sea_Eagle\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-bellied_Sea_Eagle</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wingspan.co.nz/\">www.wingspan.co.nz</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"NoSpacing\">Buller, W.L. 1873. <em>A history of the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It is the largest, heaviest eagle species yet described, weighing up to 17.8 kg and had a wingspan up to 3 metres. Near-complete skeleton finds show that it had the body and wings of a giant eagle, legs and bill larger and stronger than the largest living vulture species, and feet and claws as big as a modern day tiger&apos;s. These characteristics made it the top predator in prehistoric South Island terrestrial ecosystems. Like the iconic moa, Haast&apos;s eagle evolved through - and survived - multiple glacial periods, when larger body size would have increased survival chances. The species was named after Julius von Haast, first director of Canterbury Museum.</p>\n<p>Morphological study suggests it specialised in hunting moa up to the size and weight of adult South Island giant moa (up to 3.6 m and 249 kg). Study of near-complete skeleton finds suggests it dived on its moa prey from a high isolated treetop perch or rocky outcrop in open terrain. Bone remains show it would have been able to kill moa by flying into their hind quarters and grappling the moa with its large feet and talons before crushing the moa&apos;s skull with an extremely powerful grip. Haast&apos;s eagle became extinct 500-600 years ago, around the same time that New Zealand&apos;s moa species became extinct. Centuries-old cave drawings of huge eagle-like birds and finds of Haast&apos;s eagle bone tools in middens strongly suggest it was known to Maori, and may have been hunted. Maori oral tradition records huge birds called &quot;pouakai&quot; and &quot;hokioi&quot; that were possibly inspired by it. Haast&apos;s eagle was large enough to attack human children, as described in Maori oral tradition.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A robust, large-bodied eagle with proportionally large head, bill, legs and talons. The vulture-like bill was up to 130 mm long, and the thick talons were up to 75 mm long. The wingspan of Haast&#x2019;s eagle was up to 3 m, body length was up to 1.4 m, and adults stood up to 90 cm tall. As with other eagles, the male was smaller than the female. Maori oral tradition from the late 1800s records that it had red, black and white plumage with &quot;<em>black feathers tinged with yellow or green</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>a bunch of red feathers on its head</em>&quot;.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the much smaller Eyles&apos; harrier, which (in the North Island) reached the size of a small golden eagle.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Haast&#x2019;s eagle bones have been found at dozens of sites in the South Island and one on Stewart Island. Most were in the south and east of the South Island, with a handful in the north-west Nelson area. None was found in Fiordland or Westland. It appears to have inhabited the drier parts of the South Island, east of the Southern Alps, ranging from sea level to the subalpine zone. Its range apparently reduced during the last glacial period, retreating to mountainous areas east of the Southern Alps. Maori oral tradition from the late 1800s records that it lived &quot;<em>in the mountains</em>&quot; until its extinction.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One study estimated the prehistoric total population at 3,000 - 4,500 breeding pairs.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Haast&#x2019;s eagle became extinct 500-600 years ago, around the same time that all moa species became extinct. Overhunting of its moa prey by humans was probably the main cause of its extinction. Loss of habitat due to the burning of South Island dry mosaic forests and shrublands by humans may also have caused declines in its prey species. Haast&apos;s eagle may also have been hunted by humans because its bones, some of which had been worked into tools, have been found in middens. Two claimed sightings from the 1800s are unlikely to have been Haast&apos;s eagle.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Behaviour unknown. The largest individuals were markedly larger and almost twice as heavy as the largest living eagle species: the South American harpy eagle (&lt;9 kg; c2.2 m wingspan) and north-east Asian Steller&apos;s sea eagle (&lt;9 kg; c2.5 m). It is the only known example of an eagle species becoming the top predator in a complex ecosystem. Bone evidence shows its upper leg muscles were more suited to perching than walking. Damage found on ancient moa pelvis bones suggest that the eagle&#x2019;s bill was long enough to reach the kidneys. Its body mass was greater, and its head and bill larger, than the Eurasian black vulture. Its long, muscular toes and long, thick, sharp talons were able to drive points through moa pelvis bone. DNA study shows it evolved from a common ancestor of the Australian little eagle, 700,000 to 1.8 million years ago. The suggested 10-15 fold increase in the average weight of Haast&apos;s eagle over that period would represent the largest, fastest evolutionary increase in average weight of any known vertebrate species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mainly South Island moa species, and possibly South Island goose, and larger rail and duck species of the South Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haast%27s_Eagle\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haast%27s_Eagle</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=1360\">http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=1360</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bunce, M.; Szulkin, M.; Lerner, H.R.L.; Barnes, I.; Shapiro, B.; Cooper, A.; Holdaway, R.N. 2005.

Pale rufous/chestnut brown back with black triangular spotting, black flight feathers and a cream/white streaked breast. Small sharply hooked bill with an understated moustache/malar strip running vertically down from the back of the gape. Distinctive black subterminal band at the end of a long rectangular or fanned tail. Adult males have a grey head and tail, are sparsely spotted on the back, and are more rufous than females. Adult females have brown heads and tails, and are more heavily spotted on the back than males. Juveniles are similar to adult females, but with a less chestnut shade of brown and heavier triangular spotting on the back. The hovering flight, with angular crooked wings is characteristic. </p>\n<p class=\"NoSpacing\">Voice: a high pitched chattering <em>kee-kee-kee</em> call usually uttered during the breeding season.</p>\n<p class=\"NoSpacing\">Similar species: the most commonly seen falcon in New Zealand is the New Zealand falcon, a magpie-sized raptor that is far larger and more robust than the more delicate nankeen kestrel. New Zealand falcon have deeper, more rounded wings, rarely hover (and cannot do so for long periods like the kestrel) and are much darker brown on the back. Kestrels also lack the distinctive rufous/red &#x2018;trousers&#x2019; of the New Zealand falcon.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"NoSpacing\">Nankeen kestrels occur throughout the Australian mainland, but are uncommon non-breeding visitors to Tasmania. They are partial migrants to North Australia and Indonesia in the winter. Kestrels have bred on Lord Howe Island since 1944 and Norfolk Island since c.1971. Vagrants to New Zealand have been recorded in most regions, where they prefer open grasslands and scrubland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"NoSpacing\">Relatively frequent visitor to New Zealand. Records dating back to late 1880s are widely distributed over both main islands. Arrivals are usually of individual birds however sporadic irruptions in numbers occur, e.g. observations were made from nine locations in 1969 and 13-15 birds spread between Hokitika and Cambridge were recorded in 1990. Boom and bust population trends of prey influence productivity, and may be a factor in the numbers arriving in New Zealand, as could drought conditions, large bushfires and prevailing weather conditions. Despite multiple birds being present at one time, including two birds observed together in Hawke&apos;s Bay for five years in the 1980s, there has been no indication that kestrels have bred in New Zealand.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Quartering flights interspersed with hovering are used to search for prey in open habitats. Kestrels also hunt from a perch using a glide attack, sometimes resulting in a tail chase. Overseas they most often nest in trees, in cliff cavities or in stick nests of other birds. They will occasionally nest on the ground or on buildings. The absence of medium-sized stick nest making birds in New Zealand and a general lack of tree cavities may be factors that restrict the ability of this species to breed here. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Small birds and mammals, insects and reptiles.

Adapted to hunt within the dense New Zealand forests they are also found in more open habitats such as tussocklands and roughly grazed hill country. More recently they have been discovered breeding in exotic pine plantations. Laying their eggs in simple scrapes they can nest in a variety of locations, from within the epiphytes that grow in large trees, to on the ground under small rocky outcrops. Where they nest on the ground they are well known for attacking intruders, including humans, with aggressive dive-bombing strikes to the head.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Often seen hunting small passerines in dramatic chases, they have long pointed wings and a long tail. Wings and tail open out into a more rounded shape when soaring. When perched they have an upside-down teardrop shaped silhouette. Males are approximately a third smaller than females. All ages have a dark eye and a distinct moustache or malar stripe running from the back of a strongly hooked bill vertically down the face. Adults have yellow legs, eye-ring and cere, are largely dark brown on the back, have a streaked cream breast and a rufous under tail and thighs. Recent fledglings and juveniles are more uniformly dark brown, lacking the defined cream streaks on the breast, and their legs, eye-ring and cere are blue-grey.</p>\n<p>Voice: A loud &#x2018;kek kek kek&#x2019; is commonly uttered in defence of a territory by both adults during the breeding season. The female&#x2019;s call is deeper than the male&#x2019;s more high pitched call. Adult females and juveniles will also &#x2018;whine&#x2019; for food and a &#x2018;chitter&#x2019; is often uttered during interactions between falcons.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Sometimes confused with the swamp harrier that is commonly seen feeding on road-kill, the falcon very rarely feeds on carrion, and is smaller. Falcons are more often seen in active chasing flights rather than the lazy quartering flights typical of the harrier. The falcon lacks the obvious cream/pale rump of the harrier and glides with its wings set flat rather than in a shallow V-shape. Long-tailed cuckoo also have long pointed wings, a long tail and rapid wing beats. However falcons have a deeper wing, their tail is not quite as pronounced and their flight is less erratic. Easily distinguished by the difference in calls: the cuckoo almost always uttering its harsh chatter &#x2018;rrrp pe-pe-pe-pe-pee&#x2019; when flying. The falcon could also be confused with vagrant raptors that occasionally arrive in New Zealand from Australia. The black kite is larger (roughly the size of a harrier) and has a distinctive forked tail. The nankeen kestrel is more delicate, has a cinnamon brown back, long slender wings and a habit of hovering which our falcon does not. The black falcon is more uniformly sooty black and has far longer more pointed wings that when folded almost reach the end of the tail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Widely distributed on both main islands where suitable habitat occurs. Sparse breeder north of a line between northern Taranaki and Rotorua. Absent from Northland. Although rare on Stewart Island, populations extend as far south as the Auckland Islands. Was once present on the Chatham Islands. Falcons breed in a wide variety of habitats from the coast to above the tree line, including native podocarp and beech forest, tussocklands, roughly grazed hill country and pine forest. They may also breed in more intensively farmed areas where suitable bush remnants remain. Falcons have recently been encouraged to breed in vineyards in the Marlborough region. Although absent as breeders from most urban and intensive agricultural landscapes, juveniles can be observed almost anywhere in New Zealand during winter as they disperse from their natal territories. A pair that breeds in Zealandia/Karori Sanctuary has a foraging territory that includes much of the central city.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Widespread but rare; population estimated in the 1970s at c.4000 pairs. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Clearance of native vegetation and the intensification of land-use practices have significantly reduced the amount of habitat suitable for breeding. Habitat degradation and modification has also affected prey populations. Cats and mustelids have been filmed preying on adults and chicks. Pigs and possums take eggs and chicks, and hedgehogs may do so in some areas. Electrocution is a major problem in areas where many un-insulated power lines occur. The persecution of falcons remains commonplace throughout New Zealand, with some birds being shot every year. Captive-rearing, fostering and release techniques are well refined, and populations are being supplemented in several areas around New Zealand. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spring and summer breeding. Clutch size 1-4. Incubation is generally shared, but brooding is predominantly done by the female, while the male does most of the hunting. Eggs are laid into a simple scrape in the ground with varying amounts of cover, on a ledge or within an epiphyte in a tree. In hill country they generally nest part way up a slope. In forested areas this may be on the ground where a tree fall affords a suitable view over the surrounding gully.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A very versatile and adaptable species compared with many other falcon species. The relatively short, deep rounded wings, and long tail make them exceptionally manoeuvrable. Combined with their relatively long legs and toes this allows them to weave through dense bush and catch small birds on the wing. They often hunt from a perch &#xBE; up a tree but also hunt along habitat edges or surprise prey by contour-flying close to the ground. Home-range size differs between habitats but is around 9 km2 in pine forest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mostly small to medium-sized birds, but occasionally takes prey much larger than itself such as black shags, poultry and pheasants. Will also take mammals such as rabbits and &#xBE; grown hares. Juveniles especially will feed on insects including cicadas, dragonflies and huhu beetles, especially during the period that they are learning to hunt for themselves. Prey is generally taken in proportion to its abundance.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/nz-falcon-karearea/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/nz-falcon-karearea/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.falcons.co.uk/default.asp?id=93&amp;menu=1\">http://www.falcons.co.uk/default.asp?id=93&amp;menu=1</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.mfct.org.nz/\">http://www.mfct.org.nz</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzfalcon.org.nz/\">http://www.nzfalcon.org.nz</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.wingspan.co.nz/\">http://www.wingspan.co.nz</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Barea, L.P. 1995.

There are four records of cranes in New Zealand, but the species was not determined in any of these sightings. Two species occur in Australia: sarus crane <em>Grus antigone</em> <em>gillae</em> and brolga (Australian crane) <em>G. rubicundus</em>. The brolga occurs uncommonly in eastern Australia but is still common in northern areas. The sarus crane is an Asian species that was first recorded in Australia in 1966, since when it has spread rapidly and is now found across the north of the country. The sarus crane is slightly larger than the brolga &#x2013; it is the tallest flying bird in the world. Either species might occur in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The plumage of both crane species is generally grey; both have bare, red skin on the face and back of the head. The plumage of juvenile birds of both species is gingery, with the bare skin flesh coloured.</p>\n<p>There are four key distinguishing characters to check in order to separate brolga and sarus crane:</p>\n<p>1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The extent of red skin on the head and neck (this is confined to the face and back of the head only in brolga, but extends part way down the neck on sarus cranes)</p>\n<p>2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The presence or absence of a dewlap &#x2013; a flap of skin hanging under the chin (present in brolga where it is largest in males, absent in sarus crane)</p>\n<p>3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The colour of the trailing edge to the secondary flight feathers (dark tips in brolga, pale tips in sarus crane)</p>\n<p>4.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Leg colour (dark pink in brolga, dark grey in sarus crane)</p>\n<p>Voice: a trumpet-like call is given when flying and on the ground. The call of the sarus crane is higher pitched than that of brolga.</p>\n<p>Similar species: white-faced heron is much smaller and lacks red on the head. Cranes fly with the neck held straight out, whereas all herons and egrets usually (but not always) hold the neck retracted in an &#x2018;S&#x2019;.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Cranes occur in freshwater swamps and marshes as well as on pasture and arable farmland.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There are four New Zealand records of unidentified cranes: Clevedon, South Auckland (March-May 1947), Punakaiki, Westland (January 1968), Mossburn, Southland (March 2009), and Te Anau Downs, Southland (February 2012).</p>\n<p>The north Australian population of sarus crane is estimated at about 15,000, while that of the brolga is between 25,000 and 100,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Both brolga and sarus cranes are known to fly into powerlines in Australia and concerns have been expressed about possible windfarm mortality. Stock fencing around wetlands has also resulted in crane deaths.Cattle grazing and consequent reduction in scrub cover and an increase in grasses around wetlands may have resulted in an increase in sarus cranes, but brolgas have suffered from wetland loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Usually 2 eggs are laid in a nest of reeds and grasses in a wetland.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Both brolga and sarus cranes are partially migratory in Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Brolga feeds principally on the bulkuru sedge <em>Eleocharis dulcis</em> in Queensland, but both species will also take a wide variety of seeds, invertebrates, frogs, small mammals and reptiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2787\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2787</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2788\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2788</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brolga\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brolga</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarus_Crane\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarus_Crane</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ozcranes.net/index.html\">http://ozcranes.net/index.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Booth, C. 2007. <em>Barbed wire action plan</em>.

Their long, thin pointed bill, long slim neck, long wedge-shaped tail, and long broad wings make them look like a flying cross when in soaring flight. In Australia, darters disperse widely after breeding, using hot air thermals to glide and soar, and so it is unusual that there are only four records from New Zealand. However, it is likely that others are overlooked because of their similarity to the various shag and cormorant species that occur in the same lakes, coastal lagoons and estuaries.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Darters are large and slim, with a very long thin neck with a distinctive kink about half way down, long pointed straight yellow bill, and a very long tail. A white stripe extends from behind the eyes to about halfway down each side of the neck, and there are prominent creamy streaks on the upper wings. Males are otherwise brown-black, with a reddish patch on the middle of the throat; females and immatures are paler, with grey-brown upperparts and whitish underparts. The long, snake-like kinked neck, long straight, pointed bill (lacking a terminal hook) and slim appearance are key features that separate this species from the various shag species that occupy the same habitats.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: during nesting makes raucous, repetitive <em>kah, tjeeu, krrr</em> and <em>kururah</em> sounds, and hisses; makes clicking sounds away from the nesting site.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: black shag is markedly bulkier, slightly taller, and has all-black rather than pink and yellow legs and feet, and a hooked bill.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Darters breed from Africa and the Middle East, through India and South East Asia to Australia. In Australia most breeding colonies are in the Murray-Darling catchment and along the eastern seaboard. After breeding they disperse widely. They are most commonly found on inland waters and sheltered coastal waters; they occasionally occur at sea, near the shore, in calm conditions. Vagrant to New Zealand, there are only four records, all from freshwater or coastal waters.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are four confirmed New Zealand records of darters. The fresh skin of an adult female was found nailed to the wall of a shed near Hokitika in January 1874. Over 100 years passed before the next records with sightings of single birds at Lake Waiharara, near Kaitaia, in December 1992; Lake Daniels, Nelson, in November 2003; and Wellington Harbour in December 2003.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Darters usually forage alone, and nest solitarily or in small groups, sometimes with shags/cormorants. They usually roosts in trees and bushes over water, rarely on the ground or in reeds. Darters require smooth, open water for feeding, and riparian trees or posts for perching and to dry their wings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Darters feed by swimming underwater, then darting their necks out to impale fish on their needle-like bills. On surfacing, they toss the fish into the air and catch it head first before swallowing. They also eats insects caught above the water.

There are five species worldwide. All are large, black-and-white, with long angular wings, deeply forked tails, and long, hooked bills. As their name suggests, they are aerial pirates, often robbing other seabirds of their food during spectacular aerial manoeuvres. The great frigatebird is the larger of the two species that reach New Zealand. Adult males are completely black, whereas females, immature birds, and all plumages of the lesser frigatebird have some white on the underparts.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The great frigatebird is a large, sinister-looking seabird with predominantly or entirely black plumage. It has long narrow wings (205-230 cm wingspan), a deeply forked tail and a long hooked bill. The male is entirely black, with (when breeding) a large red sac on the throat which is inflated during courtship displays. The head of females is black, with a grey chin and throat that merges with the white breast and flanks; the underwing is black. Immature birds have orange on the head and white underparts, with completely dark underwings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: generally silent, some warbles given in flight over breeding grounds, and repeated whistling when landing. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the very similar lesser frigatebird also has distinct male, female and immature plumages. The key features to note on all frigate birds are the extent of any white markings on the underparts, particularly whether these extend onto the underwing or chin, and any orange on the head indicating immaturity. Adult male lesser frigatebirds are black with a narrow white pectoral girdle extending a short distance on to each underwing. Adult females have a black chin, and the white patch on their breast is not divided into two lobes (cf. female great frigatebird) but which extends slightly on to the underwing. Immature frigatebirds of both species are very similar (orange head, white on belly), differing only in whether the white breast patch extends onto the underwing, which is a consistent and diagnostic marker of lesser frigatebirds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Great frigatebirds are found throughout the tropical and subtropical Indian, Pacific, and south Altantic Oceans. They are vagrant to the south Pacific, including New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There have been about&#xA0;20 sightings of great frigatebirds in New Zealand since 1851, south to Castlepoint, Nelson, Cape Farewell and Westport. Most sightings have been of single birds, but there were at least eight birds on and over the Herald Islets and Raoul Island (Kermadec Islands) in March-April 2016.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Frigatebirds have a very light skeleton and long, narrow wings, making them adept and efficient fliers. They rarely swim and cannot walk on land. Great frigatebirds are the only birds known other than swifts that are able to stay aloft for months, and are assumed to be able to sleep while airborne. By using wind-drift circling, soaring and long periods of gliding, frigatebirds are able to use both convection and wind as energy sources, travelling long distances with low energy costs. Great frigatebirds&#xA0;nest in low vegetation, where they can land and take off directly from the nest site. Frigatebirds catch flying fish in mid-flight, and harass other sea birds to force them to disgorge their catch, which is then caught in mid-air by the frigatebirds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mostly flying fish and some cephalopods, all food taken while in flight.&#xA0; No New Zealand data.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Frigatebrid\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Frigatebrid</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

There are five species worldwide. All are black-and-white, with long angular wings, deeply forked tails, and long, hooked bills. As their name suggests, they are aerial pirates, often robbing other seabirds of their food during spectacular aerial manoeuvres.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lesser frigatebirds are large, predominantly black birds with long narrow wings (175-195 cm wingspan), a deeply forked tail and a long hooked bill. They are most often seen soaring stiff-winged high over the sea or coastline, occasionally descending to pursue other fish-eating birds. The male is mostly black, with a white patch on each flank which continues as a spur on to the underwing. When breeding, males have&#xA0;a large red sac of skin on the throat which is inflated during courtship displays. The neck and breast of females&#xA0;are white, contrasting with the black chin and head, which gives them the appearance of having a black hood. Females also have a white spur extending onto the underwing. Immature birds have pale orange heads, white bellies extending as a V towards the vent, and white extending onto the underwing as for adults</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: repeated whistling when landing.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the very similar great frigatebird also has distinct male, female and immature plumages. The key features to note on all frigate birds are the extent of any white markings on the underparts, particularly whether these extend onto the underwing or chin, and any orange on the head indicating immaturity. Adult male great frigatebirds are completely black. Adult females have a white chin, and the white patch on their breast is divided into two lobes by a black V reaching forward from the belly. Immature frigatebirds of both species are very similar (orange head, white on belly), differing only in whether the white breast patch extends onto the underwing, which is a consistent and diagnostic marker of lesser frigatebirds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lesser frigatebirds are found throughout the Indian Ocean, western and central Pacific Ocean, and off Brazil in the Altantic Ocean.

It is a tall elegant bird, and similar in size and proportions to the white heron, and markedly larger than a white-faced heron. Pacific herons are common throughout Australia other than the arid interior, and regularly visit Tasmania and New Guinea. One was seen on Norfolk Island in 1978, and birds have reached New Zealand on at least&#xA0;twelve occasions.</p>\n<p>The name &#x2018;Pacific heron&#x2019; is preferred to the alternative &#x2018;white-necked heron&#x2019;, as the latter is also used for the cocoi heron <em>(Ardea cocoi) </em>of South America<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Pacific heron is a large, long-legged bird with the long neck, small head and pointed bill, typical of all herons. The head, neck and breast are white except for a series of grey circular markings running centrally down the lower neck onto the breast. The back, upper wings and tail are very dark grey (maroon when breeding), and the under-wings are greyish brown. In flight a prominent white patch shows at the elbow. The bill, legs and toes are black. Flight is slow and laboured, on broad, rounded wings. The neck is folded back in flight, and the legs extend past the tail. The usual flying height is up to 50 metres, however&#xA0;Pacific herons use updrafts to soar and glide to much greater heights.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a harsh croak, usually given in flight.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: partially leucistic white-faced herons can have entirely white heads and necks, but are much smaller and paler birds compared to the big, blackish (other than head and neck) Pacific heron.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pacific herons are found in wetlands, lakes, rivers, swamps or boggy grasslands throughout most of Australia most notably in the Murray-Darling River system. They prefer freshwater locations but occasionally can be found in estuarine areas. Pacific herons migrate to otherwise arid inland areas if heavy rain events create temporary lakes and wetlands. They also use farm dams, irrigation channels or roadside drainage ditches. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are&#xA0;twelve accepted records of Pacific herons in New Zealand: Methven (April-July 1952), Macauley Island, Kermadec Islands (November 1980), Onepu, Houhora (October 1981), Waipu (January 1984), Hokitika (June-July 2002), Totara, Timaru (January-March 2003),&#xA0;Toko, Stratford (June 2003), Otapiri, Southland (May 2013), near Wellsford (September 2013), Athol, Otago (December 2013), Oreti River, Southland (April 2014), and Wakefield, Nelson (May 2014).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pacific herons are most often seen as singles or in pairs, but can form flocks when moving inland to areas that are flooded after rain. They breed in colonies, often with other heron species, ibises or spoonbills. They can be aggressive when foraging, defending a feeding territory. When foraging, Pacific herons walk at a steady pace, then hesitate with neck extended before lunging at prey. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pacific herons eat a range of small aquatic and terrestrial animals, but surprisingly, they rarely take fish. Their diet includes insects, molluscs and crustaceans, and they may make use of a hard surface to smash a shell or carapace against to access the meat. Pacific herons glean insects from foliage, and are often seen parting grasses or reeds in search of food. They sometimes steal food from other birds, and will eat carrion.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-necked_Heron\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-necked_Heron</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Its sole New Zealand breeding site near Okarito Lagoon in Westland is well-known and well-protected, but elsewhere it is &apos;He kotuku rerenga tahi&apos; or the bird of single flight, implying something seen perhaps once in a lifetime. When seen in close proximity it is a magnificent bird, with its large size and clean white plumage.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A large white heron with a long yellow bill, long dark legs and a very long neck. When breeding, the bill becomes grey-black and&#xA0;long filamentous plumes develop, mainly on the back. In flight, the white heron tucks its&#xA0;head back into&#xA0;its shoulders so that the length of its neck is hidden, giving it a hunched appearance. When walking, the white heron has an elegant upright stance showing the extreme length of its neck. When resting it is more hunched with its head tucked in, making the bird appear more bulky. Important identification characters when separating white herons from other white egret species in New Zealand include overall size, relative neck length, bill colour and shape, and how far the gape (i.e. the corner of the mouth) extends back in relation to the eye. The white heron is the largest, longest-necked of the egrets, and the gape extends well behind the eye.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a harsh croak.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the most similar species in New Zealand is the plumed egret, a vagrant species which is smaller (the size of a white-faced heron),&#xA0;has a shorter neck, never has a dark bill (cf. breeding white heron), and the gape extends to level with the eye, but not beyond. Plumed egrets show a strong preference for freshwater wetlands, and so rarely occur in estuaries, whereas white herons are equally at home in both freshwater and brackish habitats.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The royal spoonbill is nearly as large as the white heron but, as its name suggests, it has a very large spoon-shaped (black) bill. This makes it easy to distinguish between the two species. Non-breeding cattle egrets have similar colouration but are a third the size of a white heron, with a much shorter neck. Cattle egrets are often seen as flocks in pasture, but beware of lone birds in estuarine habitat or wetland. The little egret is much smaller, with a rapier-thin black bill.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White herons are most often seen in harbours and estuaries, but they also visit freshwater wetlands, including high country lakes, and are vagrant to several outlying island groups (Chatham, Snares, Auckland, Campbell and Macquarie Islands). The only New Zealand breeding colony is on the Waitangiroto River, just north of Okarito Lagoon, Westland. About 30 pairs of white herons breed here, mainly in the crowns of tree ferns overhanging the river, under tall kahikatea forest. A viewing hide at the site can be visited during the breeding season via a jetboat ride and a short walk, with access managed by an ecotourism operator licensed by the Department of Conservation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White herons are widespread and abundant throughout Asia and Australia, where they are generally known as eastern great egrets. The New Zealand population is small (150-200 birds) but apparently stable.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Okarito heronry has occupied essentially the same site since before its location was revealed by a surveyor in 1865. White herons have never been recorded attempting to breed anywhere else in New Zealand. Despite the risks of the entire population breeding at a single location, the colony has thrived throughout. It is well protected legally (as a nature reserve) and by predator trapping and carefully controlled visitation. The most common cause of white heron mortality in New Zealand is birds being hit by cars, as many roads pass close to coastal wetlands, and white herons fly low and slow when first getting airborne.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Birds arrive at the breeding colony in August. Nests are built in trees and tree ferns up to 15 m high. Adjacent taller trees are used by royal spoonbills. The 3-5 eggs are laid in September-October and are incubated by both parents. Nestlings are fed by partial regurgitation by both parents. Leaving the nest begins with short flights, followed by final departure about 64 days after hatching.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Males occupying a nest site will defend it against intruders. Courtship displays include shaking twigs gathered from near the nest, preening displays and fanning of the nuptial plumes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The breeding season at Okarito Lagoon coincides with the whitebait run, and these fish are the primary food during nesting. At other locations their diet includes small fish, frogs, skinks, invertebrates and even small birds, which can be caught if they fly too close to a foraging heron. Hunting is usually in daylight, with the bird waiting motionlessly for prey to pass, or walking slowly. White herons will sometimes steal fish from other birds such as shags. They usually feed alone, even when several birds are present at the same site.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Egret\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Egret</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/herons/page-1\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/herons/page-1</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kotuku.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kotuku.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whiteherontours.co.nz/\">http://www.whiteherontours.co.nz/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005 <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand. </em>Auckland, Viking.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>International Union for Conservation of Nature</em><em>.</em> <em>IUCN red list of threatened species.</em> <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\">http://www.iucnredlist.org</a> (sighted 21 July 2012). </p>\n<p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

In breeding plumage there are extensive areas of ginger on the crown, neck and mantle, and long plumes on the neck and back; the legs become yellow and the bill is reddish.

They arrived in Australia in 1948, and were first recorded in New Zealand in 1963.Cattle egrets can be found over much of lowland New Zealand. Flocks are loyal to particular areas in successive years. They are more widespread soon after arriving in autumn, but birds tend to congregate in preferred areas as winter progresses. Favoured sites include Kaipara Harbour, Rangiriri (Waikato), Lake Ellesmere (Canterbury), Tasman Bay, and Inch Clutha (Otago). They are predominantly found in damp pasture, and associate with cattle and, to a lesser extent, sheep.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Following the first Canterbury records in 1963, increasing numbers arrived in autumn over subsequent years, peaking in the late 1980s at over 3200 birds. The wintering population has declined fairly steadily since then, mirroring a fall in breeding numbers in Australia. They usually occur in small flocks, though occasionally in excess of 100 birds.<strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Not considered globally threatened, but the reduced population in Australia is causing some concern.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cattle egrets are monogamous and breed colonially, frequently with other egrets and herons, nesting in small trees, often near water. Up to 7 (but normally 2-4) eggs laid in unlined nest of twigs and small branches. Not confirmed to have bred in New Zealand.<strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cattle egrets feed in association with stock, hunting prey that is disturbed by cattle and sheep. They are often found alongside white-faced herons, and occasionally perch on the backs of stock. In New Zealand they are wary of humans, but are often habituated to humans and approachable elsewhere in their range. They frequently fly short distances within or between paddocks, and prefer to roost in macrocarpas or other large trees. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Birds tagged in Australia have been seen in New Zealand on at least two occasions. Although none has been proven to make the return journey, it is assumed that most birds go back to Australia after overwintering. A few birds spend the summer in New Zealand</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main food in New Zealand is earthworms, but also grass grubs and moth larvae.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_egret\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_egret</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>Field guide to the birds of New Zealand.</em> Viking: Auckland</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Maddock, M.; Geering, D. 1993.

A birder with a library of field guides from around the world or on-line checklists may encounter an array of common and scientific names for this bird. Plumed egret and intermediate egret are the common names used in New Zealand. Some recent books and on-line lists use the scientific name <em>Mesophoyx intermedia</em>. <em>Egretta intermedia</em> appears in older books. <em>Ardea intermedia</em> is the scientific name in the 2010 <em>Checklist of the birds of New Zealand.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The plumed egret is a medium-sized all-white egret with a relatively short, stout yellow bill. The bill turns reddish in breeding plumage. The neck is about the same length as the body, and typically held in an &apos;S&apos;-shaped curve. When breeding, plumed egrets acquire long filamentous plumes from scapulars and breast, and green facial skin. The long legs are generally dark.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: silent in New Zealand</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: eight species of mainly white egrets, herons, ibises and spoonbills have been recorded in New Zealand. All are sometimes seen on their own, making size estimation difficult. Other field marks should be added to impression of size, for separation, particularly from little egret and white heron.&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The white ibis and both species of spoonbill have very different bill shapes from egrets and should be easily separated. Royal spoonbill, which has a black bill, is the only common species among this group. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cattle egret in non-breeding plumage is all white with a yellow bill, but is much smaller and more stocky with shorter neck and legs. Long feathers under the bill give a &#x201C;jowly&#x201D; appearance. The white morph reef heron has been recorded at least once in New Zealand. It has a more hunched, horizontal stance and dark grey bill. The reef heron is strictly marine and usually seen on rocky shorelines. In contrast, the plumed egret is most often seen inland around fresh water.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little egret and white heron, like plumed egret acquire filamentous plumes from the breast and scapulars in breeding plumage. The little egret is smaller with a long, black bill which is much finer than in the plumed egret, with only traces of yellow. Little egrets in New Zealand will have some yellow on their feet, even if only on the underside. They are typically more active and erratic than plumed egrets which by comparison are slow and graceful when feeding. The white heron is bigger and has a longer neck that is 1.5 times its body length, with a more sharply kinked &apos;S&apos; shape than plumed. A diagnostic field mark separating these two species is that the gape line on white herons goes back beyond the eye, but on&#xA0;plumed egrets it&#xA0;stops level with the back of the eye.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Plumed egrets are widespread and common through much of Africa, Asia and Australia, mainly occurring in freshwater wetlands. This contrasts with little egret (especially) and white heron, which are more often seen in estuaries. Ironically, the first New Zealand record was at Manawatu Estuary (1973).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand records </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Plumed egrets have been recorded in New Zealand at least 18 times, with several more unconfirmed sightings. &#xA0;They have been seen from Kaikohe south to Lake Ellesmere, and from Cobden (West Coast) to Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, with 4 records from the wetlands of the lower Waikato River. The most recent record&#xA0;was one&#xA0;at Tomahawk Lagoon, Dunedin, in November&#xA0;2014.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A bird primarily of marshy freshwater, inland wetlands, river edges, suburban ditches, or wet paddocks, and occasionally saline estuaries. Overseas, plumed egrets are often seen near human habitation. Some may arrive in New Zealand with migrating cattle egrets. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fish, frogs and insects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_Egret\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_Egret</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brazil, M. 2008. <em>Birds of East Asia</em>.

It is a tall, elegant, blue-grey bird that can be seen stalking its prey in almost any aquatic habitat, including damp pasture and playing fields. Because it occupies space also shared with people it is usually well habituated to their presence, and may allow close approach.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The white-faced heron is a medium-sized heron with primarily blue-grey plumage. As the name suggests it has white on the face and the front of its neck. The back is medium blue-grey with the chest and underside more brown-toned. In breeding plumage, white-faced herons have strap-like grey plumes on the back, and shorter pinkish brown plumes on the breast. The dagger-like bill is dark grey, dull yellow at the base, and the legs are pale yellow. In flight the white-faced heron usually tucks its head back towards its shoulders in the characteristic heron posture, but it will also fly with the neck out-stretched. Its open wings show contrast between the pale grey fore-wing and dark grey main flight feathers on both the upper and lower surfaces. Immature birds lack the white face.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a harsh croak, usually given in flight.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the reef heron is similar in size but is much darker and uniform in colour and has a more hunched stance&#xA0;than the white-faced heron</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White-faced herons occur throughout Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. They are a relatively new species in New Zealand, having self-introduced in the 1940s. From the 1950s onwards&#xA0;numbers have grown rapidly and they are now widespread throughout the country, including the Chatham Islands. It is primarily a bird of rocky shores and estuary mudflats, but can also be found near the shallow edges of lakes up to 500 m altitude, and on farm ponds. Following rain, white-faced herons are often seen in damp pasture and on sports fields, including within urban areas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White-faced herons have been recorded as vagrants at the Kermadec Islands, Snares Islands, Antipodes Island, Auckland Islands and Campbell Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The white-faced heron is one of New Zealand&apos;s commonest large birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White-faced herons are usually tree-top dwellers, favouring the tops of large pine trees or macrocarpa growing near water. They have also been know to nest on man-made structures.&#xA0;A loose platform is built where the 3-5 eggs are incubated by both parents. There is usually only one nest per tree, but some breed in loose colonies. In northern areas, nesting starts as early as June, but is later further south. Laying peaks around October. Incubation takes about 26 days. It is unusual for more than two chicks to be raised per brood. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Foraging white-faced herons walk slowly with long, controlled steps, watching for any signs of prey, which&#xA0;is grabbed with lightning speed. When white-faced herons occur at high densities, e.g. on mudflats, aggressive displays may be directed to other herons that approach too close. Roosting white-faced herons perch in trees or on top of man-made structures such as street lights. They roost solitarily or occasionally as pairs. During courtship and nesting, white-faced herons raise their plumes, and they may perform aerial displays near the nest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">White-faced herons catch and consume a wide range of prey, including small fish, crabs, worms, insects, spiders, mice, lizards, tadpoles and frogs.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-faced_Heron\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-faced_Heron</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/6434/white-faced-heron\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/6434/white-faced-heron</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whitefacedheron.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whitefacedheron.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.

Its legs and bill are black, with yellow soles to its long toes. In breeding plumage, a pair of long, slender plumes grow from the back of the head, curving elegantly down to the back, and filamentous plumes develop on the lower back and breast. The facial skin turns bright red or blue when breeding, but this has not been reported in New Zealand. Juvenile birds have greenish-black legs and duller yellow feet. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The little egret is widely distributed throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is reasonably common in most states of Australia but is listed as threatened in Victoria. The main threats to little egrets elsewhere are from coastal reclamation and wetland draining, especially in its feeding and breeding areas of Asia. In New Zealand, little egrets occur almost exclusively in estuarine habitats.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little egrets are scarce annual migrants to New Zealand, arriving in autumn and departing in early spring, with some individuals remaining over summer. They are usually seen as single birds, with the largest New Zealand flock being five birds. The first New Zealand record was a bird initially thought to be a white morph reef heron, at Wairau Rivermouth in 1944-45. Little egrets have subsequently been seen throughout the country, from the Three Kings Islands and Parengarenga Harbour to Bluff. One or two birds have long been resident at the Clive wetlands in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, which is the most reliable place in New Zealand to view this scarce species. There was a minor influx in 2013-14, with birds seen at numerous locations from Northland to Southland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little egrets are generally solitary in New Zealand, frequenting coastal areas in preference to freshwater wetlands. There are no breeding records from New Zealand. In countries where it does breed it is usually a silent species except for croaking and bubbling calls that are made at breeding colonies. It does have a harsh alarm call when disturbed. It is an active predator that hunts its prey using a variety of methods.They use stealth to either stalk their prey in shallow water or wait in ambush. They also run through the water with raised wings to disturb small fish and invertebrates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_egret\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_egret</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

They use a wide range of nesting sites, including on the ground, cliff ledges and at tree bases. They may nest alone or in loose groups, breeding as monogamous pairs. Both adults incubate the single egg and feed the chick, and are generally faithful to previous nesting sites. White-tailed tropicbirds perform acrobatic display flights in pairs or small groups, with frequent calling. They feed by both plunge-diving and surface feeding, often with other species. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mostly fish and squid.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Website</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_Tropicbird\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_Tropicbird</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3650\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3650</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Marchant, S.; Higgins, P.J.

The grey-blue legs are short for the bird&#x2019;s size. The neck is folded back in flight. Pelicans use thermal currents to attain considerable height, where they can glide from thermal to thermal. They have been recorded at up to 3000 m altitude. They often fly in V-formation when in flocks. Juveniles are white and dark brown, with the brown feathers located where adults are black.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: none.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australian pelicans are found throughout Australia except the central desert area. They also occur in parts of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. They frequent canals, rivers, lakes and estuaries. Following heavy rains, Australian pelicans breed in thousands in previously dry inland lakes. They have been recorded from Palau, Norfolk Island, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Nauru, as well as New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">First recorded at Jerusalem on the Whanganui River in 1890, with subsequent sightings on the Wairoa River near Dargaville (Aug-Sep 1976), Southland (one found dead, Nov 1977) and Canterbury (up to 4 birds, Dec 1977 - Jun 1978). At least 14 pelicans reached New Zealand in August 2012, where they were mainly seen on the Wairoa River, northern Kaipara Harbour, with individuals and smaller groups ranging between Parengarenga Harbour and the Whanganui River estuary. Eighteen were counted together in April 2013, and at least one bird was still present on the Kaipara Harbour as late as March 2015.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Usually found in flocks from a few birds to several thousand, occasionally as single birds. Pelicans can be found in residential areas as well as open country. Considered monogamous, with pairs bonding for each breeding season. Clutch size typically 1 to 3 eggs, occasionally up to 5. Nesting is in open areas where they tend to use a slight depression to build a nest of assorted materials in a circular platform. Pelicans are usually quiet both in flight and when at roost. The call has been described as a grunt or belching sound. They are more vocal when they are in breeding flocks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fish are the main food, but also crustaceans, insects and other small live animals including chicks of other bird species. When taking fish, they paddle forward with the bill open, plunge their head in and scoop up fish into their bill pouch. Pelicans often forage together in a line pushing schools of fish into shallow water where they surround the school and take turns scooping fish from the water.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Pelican\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Pelican</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.avianweb.com/australianpelicans.html\">http://www.avianweb.com/australianpelicans.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Edgar, A.J. 1978.

Their flight is also characteristic, with deep wristy flapping flight. The Cape gannet is an extremely rare vagrant to New Zealand waters, and is probably only reliably identified if it is seen closely on land, either as a bird visiting one of the breeding colonies of the similar-looking Australasian gannet, <em>Morus serrator</em>, or as a fresh corpse washed up on a beach.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Cape gannet is a large white-bodied seabird with black primary and secondary wing feathers, pale orange-yellow head, and a black tail. In general appearance, other than the tail pattern, it is similar to but slightly larger than the familiar Australasian gannet. The tail of the Cape gannet is wholly black, in contrast to the black central and white outer tail feathers of the Australasian gannet. Overall, the species is probably not reliably distinguished at sea from Australasian gannets. Seen close up, the Cape gannet has a distinctly longer black, featherless gular stripe, stretching from the base of the lower mandible down to the middle of the throat (confined to the base of the chin in the Australasian gannet); a pale orange-yellow head (more golden in the Australasian gannet); a white rather than pale grey iris; and brighter, cyan stripes down the foreleg and toes (electric blue in the Australasian gannet). Juvenile Cape gannets are much darker brown than the light brown, speckled juvenile Australasian gannets. Although immature birds are similar, Cape gannets are more uniformly dark brown above.</p>\n<p>Calls: similar to but deeper than Australasian gannet (about two-thirds of an octave lower in the Cape gannet).</p>\n<p>Similar species: apart from the Australasian gannet, the only other species with which it might be confused is the masked booby, a smaller, similarly coloured species that has a white, not yellow-orange head, and a yellow, not bluish-grey bill. The other predominantly black-and-white seabirds are the much larger royal and wandering albatrosses, which have quite different wing shapes and flight.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Cape gannets breed on arid offshore islands along the South African and Namibian coasts, foraging in adjacent seas. Outside the breeding season, birds range widely in offshore waters, often following large shoals of sardines on their annual migration north along the eastern coast of South Africa. Some birds range more widely into oceanic waters, occasionally as far afield as South America, the southern Indian ocean, and Australia.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The&#xA0;first New Zealand record of Cape gannet was an adult male observed at the Australasian gannet colony at Cape Kidnappers for five successive breeding seasons between 1997 and 2002, then again briefly at the start of the 2005 breeding season. During much of this time the bird was paired with a female Australasian gannet, hatching 3 chicks, 2 of which fledged successfully. One of these fledged birds, a male, returned to the colony 4 years later, in September 2005, where it was later seen incubating an egg. The second record was a bird among the gannet colony at the tip of Farewell Spit in December 2015. Vagrant birds have also been recorded from Australia on several occasions, with a pair fledging a chick at Point Danger, Portland, in February 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>A typical gannet, flying 20-30 m above the sea, periodically plunging down below the surface to pursue fish. Just before entering the water, the wings are swept back against the body, giving the birds the most streamlined shape possible for the dive, so that they look like javelins when hitting the water. As a result, the birds lose little or no speed initially on entering the water. Inflatable air sacs and a reinforced skull cushion the shock of impact.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to Australasian gannet, but no New Zealand data available. In South Africa, they feed predominantly on pilchard, <em>Sardinops ocellatus</em>, anchovy, <em>Engraulis capensis </em>(=<em>Engraulis encrasicolus</em>), saury, <em>Scomberesox saurus,</em> and sardine, <em>Sardinops sagax</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Webpages</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Gannet\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Gannet</a>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Adams, N.J.; Klages, N.T.W. 1999.

The trailing edges of its wings and a varying proportion of its central tail feathers are black. The wedge-shaped bill is bluish-grey, with a lining of black; the skin surrounding the eye is intensely blue. The head plumage is buff-yellow, which extends down the neck. The sexes cannot be reliably distinguished in the field. Juveniles have mottled dark brown and white plumage, and are separable from immatures, which gradually acquire more white over several moults, before acquiring full adult plumage when about 3 years old.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a distinctive &#x2018;<em>urrah urrah</em>&#x2019; to announce landing, during territorial indication at the nest site, and during mutual bill fencing and bowing with the mate. Also an attenuated &#x2018;<em>oo-ah</em>&#x2019; to indicate take-off. Both sexes&#x2019; calls are identical, with some locational and marked individual variation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the closely related Cape gannet is similar in size and appearance, and has occurred in New Zealand as a vagrant. It differs in having a longer black gular stripe extending from the chin down the throat, all its tail feathers are dark, and it has a slower, lower frequency landing call. The masked booby (which breeds on the Kermadec Islands, and occasionally strays to water off the northern North Island) is smaller, and has a yellow bill and white head. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australasian gannets nest in dense breeding colonies on the New Zealand mainland and coastal rocks and islands, as well as off south-east Australia and Tasmania. Although gannets can be seen occasionally from most places along the coasts of the New Zealand main islands, most gannetries are situated off the North Island. The largest mainland gannetry is at Cape Kidnappers, with around 5,000 breeding pairs. Other mainland breeding sites include Muriwai and Farewell Spit.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australasian gannets mostly feed on waters over the continental shelf. They prefer flat ground for nesting, rather than cliff ledges. Breeding colonies are mostly situated at sites that are completely or largely surrounded by the sea, i.e. on islands or headlands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">New Zealand holds the bulk of the Australasian gannet breeding population, with about 13% of the population breeding in Australia. The New Zealand population was about 46,000 pairs in 1980-81 and continued to increase at about 2% per annum, although some former breeding sites have been abandoned. Their population is probably regulated by the availability of suitable prey within easy flying distance of breeding colonies. Southern black-backed gulls take some eggs and young nestlings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The breeding season extends from July, when birds first return to the gannetries, to fledging in March-April. Males arrive earlier than females, and re-occupy or establish and defend a nest. From the onset of breeding, the male brings nesting material such as brown algae <em>Carpophyllum</em>, which he retrieves from the shallows. Both members of the pair form and maintain the nest mound, particularly when the surrounding ground is soft from rain. The single egg is produced during an asynchronous laying period that starts in August at Hauraki Gulf gannetries, and September at Cape Kidnappers. A replacement egg can be laid within 4 weeks if the first egg is lost. Laying of replacement eggs can extend into January. Rare two-egg nests may be due to two females laying in the same nest. Eggs are incubated while being held between the webbings of the gannets&#x2019; feet. The Australasian gannet can only successfully incubate a single egg. Both sexes share the incubation duty, and later brood the chick on the top of their webbed feet. Feeds are delivered by both parents as incomplete regurgitations, which the chick receives by pushing its bill into the parents&#x2019; throats.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Characteristic behaviours at breeding colonies include mutual bill fencing and bowing of mates at the nest, the territorial headshake and bow at the nesting site, and sky-pointing as an indication of the intention to take flight. The torpedo-like plunge dive of gannets is a spectacular sight, particularly when large foraging flocks form over surface aggregations of fish. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fledglings from New Zealand fly directly to Australia, and typically do not return to their home colonies until their third year. Some New Zealand breeders migrate to Australian and Tasmanian waters to winter between breeding seasons. Australasian gannets often breed with the same partner over consecutive seasons. Some birds retain the same mate for the rest of their lives, but divorces do occur.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australasian gannets mainly eat fish, particularly pilchards, Australian anchovies, barracouta, garfish, mackerel and horse mackerel. Other recorded prey includes New Zealand piper, saury, flying fish, yellow-eye mullet, a puffer, and also squid.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Gannet\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Gannet</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/takapu.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/takapu.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bunce, A. 2001.

Found throughout tropical seas, it exhibits a range of plumages from mostly white to entirely mid-brown (all morphs have black trailing edge to the wing). At close range its bright red feet are diagnostic. There have been two New Zealand records: 2-3 birds seen at the Kermadec Islands in 2016, and one at Muriwai gannet colony in 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-footed boobies are slender gannet-like birds that occur in a range of plumages. Like other members of the family, they have a long conical bill, slender neck, long narrow wings, and long pointed tail. White morph birds are mainly white with light buff or orange on the head, and black primaries and secondaries (the main flight feathers on the wing), plus black coverts. There is a diagnostic black patch near the carpal joint on the underwing. Brown morph birds are mid-brown all over, with darker flight feathers. A common intermediate morph is mid-brown with a white rump and tail. Birds may be any shade between mid-brown and white, and are never as dark as the chocolate brown plumage of brown boobies. It is the only booby that can have a white tail (though it can be black in the Galapagos subspecies, and is dark in the darkest brown morph birds). All morphs have pale blue bills with pink base, pink facial skin, and bright red feet and legs. Females are slightly larger than males. Juveniles are brown or grey-brown, streaked darker, and are usually paler below, with grey or greyish-pink legs and feet. Birds become paler with age, until adult plumage and bare-part coloration is attained when about 2.5 years old.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: juvenile Australasian gannet and masked booby are both predominantly brown, but are much larger than [brown morph] red-footed booby and have dorsal plumage speckled with white. Juvenile brown boobies are darker brown on the back, head and upper breast, sharply demarcated from the paler brown underparts. Adult Australasian gannet and masked booby are much larger than [white morph] red-footed booby, always have some (or all) tail feathers black, and do not have a black patch near the carpal joint on the underwing. None of the other gannet or booby species have pale blue bills or red feet. Red-footed boobies hold their wings more forward, and flexed at the carpal joint (other boobies hold their wings straighter).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-footed boobies have a wide distribution over tropical seas of the Pacific, Indian and western Atlantic Oceans, including the Caribbean Sea. They forage over deep water up to 150 km from land. The nearest breeding colony to the Kermadec Islands is on &#x2018;Ata (the southernmost Tongan island, 780 km to north-east), where 10,000 birds were estimated to be present in 1990. They also breed on cays in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). Nests are almost always in trees or other vegetation, up to 70 m above sea level.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The first New Zealand record was two or three birds seen and photographed on and over Napier Islet (Herald Islets, Kermadec Islands) on 31 Mar and 2 Apr 2016. At least one each&#xA0;intermediate and&#xA0;brown morph birds were present. The next record was less than ten months later, when a white morph bird with a dark tail (indicating that&#xA0;it was from the eastern tropical Pacific) was first seen at Muriwai gannet colony on 18 Jan 2017.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-footed boobies are one of the most abundant and widespread members of the sulid family. However, many breeding colonies are subject to human disturbance, and rats may take chicks and unguarded eggs. As they nest in trees, red-footed boobies are very vulnerable to habitat destruction.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-footed boobies are more pelagic than other sulids (gannets and boobies), and are the species most likely to be seen far from land. They nest and roost in trees (most other boobies are ground-nesters), and often roost on moving vessels. Red-footed boobies may follow boats for hundreds of kilometres. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Their main food is flying-fish, but they also take squid (including flying squid). Prey is caught by plunge-diving (usually up to 8 m, sometimes higher) or in flight, when the fish and squid are air-borne, after being chased by underwater predators (including dolphins, mahi-mahi and tuna) or disturbed by ships. Red-footed boobies may feed in mixed flocks with other seabirds (including tropicbirds and noddies), and are frequently pursued by frigatebirds intent on stealing food items that the boobies have caught.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Red-footed boobies are colonial, with some colonies holding thousands of pairs. A single egg is laid (cf. 2 in masked booby and brown booby). Breeding can occur throughout the year, at intervals of 11-15 months after the&#xA0;last successful laying (with failed breeders relaying sooner). They can live to at least 23 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-footed_booby\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-footed_booby</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22696694/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22696694/0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2016/09/28/two-new-birds-for-new-zealand-herald-petrel-and-red-footed-booby/\">Two new birds for New Zealand&#xA0;&#x2013; Herald petrel and red-footed booby</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A.; Sargatal, J. 1992. <em>Handbook of the Birds of the World, vol. 1: Ostrich to Ducks</em>.

It is slightly smaller than a gannet, and similar to one in shape and behaviour, if not colour. Vagrant brown boobies reach New Zealand waters most years, mainly around the northern North Island, but also frequently around Nelson and Golden Bay. They often enter harbours, or roost alongside gannets at their colonies.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Female brown boobies are slightly larger than males, with an approximate wingspan of 150 cm and average weight of 1.3 kg (140 cm and 1.0 kg for the male). The head, neck, back and top side of wings are a uniform chocolate brown in colour. The brown finishes abruptly across the breast, with the belly and undersides of the wings being white, apart from broad brown edges to the underwing. The legs are yellow shading slightly green. The bill is long and conical. Facial skin colour differs between the sexes, with the male having blue skin and blue-grey bill and the female yellow skin and the bill yellow shading to grey. Immature and juvenile birds differ from adults in having the underparts mottled brown or grey, though still sharply separated from the chocolate brown breast and upperparts. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: juvenile Australasian gannet and masked booby are both predominantly brown, but are much paler than juvenile brown boobies, especially on the hind neck, and lack the chocolate brown hood extending to the upper breast, sharply demarcated from the paler underparts. Brown morph red-footed boobies do not have a sharp demarcation line across the breast (this is prominent even in juvenile brown boobies).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown boobies have a wide distribution over tropical seas of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, plus the Caribbean Sea. The closest breeding sites to New Zealand are islands and cays of the Australian Great Barrier Reef. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There have been dozens if not hundreds of sightings of brown boobies in New Zealand since the first record at Napier in July 1888. Most records have been from the Hauraki Gulf and Northland, with multiple records among the gannets on Horuhoru Island (north-east of Waiheke Island) and at Muriwai. Other sites with multiple records include Houhora Harbour, Nelson, and the Farewell Spit gannet colony. The southernmost record was off Stewart Island, in March 2015. Three birds were seen together at L&apos;Esperance Rock, Kermadec Islands in March 2016, and another three at the Muriwai gannet colony in May 2016.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown boobies are not a threatened species, but many breeding colonies are subject to human disturbance, and rats may take chicks and unguarded eggs.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brown boobies feed solitarily or in small groups. They can form large rafts sitting on the water when resting. Most New Zealand sightings have been of single birds. Males tend to call with a whistling sound but seldom when in flight, whereas females have a honking call particularly when nesting. Brown boobies are often seen close but rarely over land. Flight height is usually&#xA0;up to 30 metres with most plunge-diving carried out from 15 metres or less. They typically dive at a shallower angle than gannets. Brown boobies also chase flying fish (their major food item) while they are airborne, catching the fish either in flight or as they re-enter the water. Other fish and squid are also taken by plunge diving.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_booby\">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_booby</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Hawkins, J.M.; Cook, W.; Smit, . 1992.

The dark facial skin surrounding the eyes and bill resembles a mask. Masked boobies range widely over tropical and subtropical open ocean, feeding mostly by plunge diving. When these birds are sighted close to land, it is usually a sign of a breeding location. Some individuals remain close to their breeding grounds and defend these throughout the year. The breeding distribution of the masked booby includes tropical oceanic islands around the world. The New Zealand indigenous subspecies also breeds on Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The adult masked booby resembles a small gannet that is lacking the yellow head markings. The neck, body and wings are long and slender, and the tail is long and wedge-shaped. The plumage is pure white, apart from black flight feathers on the trailing edge of the entire wing, and black tail feathers (though the central tail feathers can be white). The long straight serrated bill is yellow. Foot colour can vary between individuals from greyish-green over olive to yellow. The species&#x2019; name is derived from the dark grey-blue, almost black, facial skin, which is reminiscent of a mask. The Tasman booby is distinguished from other subspecies by its dark brown iris and longer wing; the irides of other subspecies of masked booby are yellow.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The plumage of juvenile masked boobies is mostly grey-brown above and on the head, with a lighter mottled belly, underside of the wings, and collar. The feet and bill are not as brightly coloured as in adults, with a blue-green tinge to the yellow tones. Immature birds show an increased proportion of white in their plumage compared with the juveniles, particularly a lighter-coloured head.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: sexually dimorphic; the adult male produces a high-pitched descending whistle, the female a honk or a croak. Both types of vocalisations can be produced as a single call or as a series of calls. Juvenile calls resemble the voice of the female. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Australasian and Cape gannets are larger, with shorter tails and yellow heads. Juvenile masked boobies are similar to brown boobies (especially juveniles), which occur as vagrants to New Zealand. Young brown boobies are darker than young masked boobies, having a much darker head and neck, sharply separated from the paler, mottled brown belly. In contrast, young masked boobies are much paler on the hind neck and belly, without any sharp demarcation between the dark head and pale belly. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Masked boobies breed on offshore islands all around the tropics, and have a widespread distribution at sea extending into the subtropics. The proximity of breeding grounds to clear, deep waters is important. In New Zealand, masked boobies breed only on the Kermadec Islands, and are a rare vagrant to the coasts of the North Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Masked boobies prefer to nest on unvegetated wind-exposed level ground such as on cliff tops and island plateaux, or, in other parts of the world, low-lying cays and atolls. The foraging habitat is the open ocean, where prey is caught by deep-plunging.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About 100 pairs of masked boobies nest on the Kermadec Islands, 100s of birds on Lord Howe Island, and around 900 birds on the Norfolk Islands. The total population for the subspecies is probably fewer than 2000 individuals.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Across its breeding range, the masked booby is most threatened by humans and introduced predators. The Kermadec Island breeding populations are well protected, and all introduced predators have been eradicated from the group. Declines in populations have occurred during severe El Ni&#xF1;o events.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Masked boobies mostly breed in loose colonies with very low densities of nests. The pair bond is monogamous, and mates are often retained across several seasons. The pairs defend their breeding territories, often re-using the same nest spot over several years. Both sexes share incubation as well as brooding and chick rearing. The eggs are incubated under the webs of the feet. The first-hatched chick expels its sibling from the nest, typically within the first days after its hatching. Exceptionally, both chicks have been observed to survive for several weeks. The chick is brooded for the first 3-4 weeks, and is fed by incomplete regurgitation by both parents, right through to about 4-8 weeks after fledging.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Masked boobies forage solitarily or in pairs or small groups at sea, mostly over deep water, and sometimes large distances from breeding colonies. Nutrient-rich upwelling zones are often important feeding grounds. Masked boobies typically deep-plunge for their prey. They are also capable of shallow plunges and occasionally take flying fish on the wing. On land, the masked booby shows a suite of agonistic, territorial behaviours. These include out-posting, leaning forward, bill held high, to mark its nest site against incoming birds; yes-no headshaking, also with the bill held upwards against approaching birds; and wing-flailing and jabbing against intruders at the nest. Skypointing is used in two contexts: to indicate take-off, or during advertising for a mate. Behaviours of pair formation include parading, mostly by the male, intent gazing, mandible clashing between mates in ritualised mutual jabbing, and symbolic nest building. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A landing call is produced when incoming to the nest site; at sea, a high-pitched call occasionally precedes the descent for prey capture. Birds are very vocal at the colony, both during agonistic and pair-bonding behaviours.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Masked boobies eat fish, squid and octopi. Fish species taken include flying fish, needlefish, and various perciforms, also flying squid and other cephalopods. Few data are available on the prey of birds breeding on the Kermadec Islands, although flying fish have been reported.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><cite><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Booby\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Booby</a></cite></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><cite><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Booby\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Booby</a></cite></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090811-extinct-booby-masked.html\">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090811-extinct-booby-masked.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><cite><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/gannets-and-boobies/3\">www.teara.govt.nz/en/gannets-and-boobies/3</a></cite></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><cite><a href=\"http://www.avianweb.com/maskedboobies.html\">www.avianweb.com/maskedboobies.html</a></cite></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><cite><a href=\"http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/maskedbooby.htm\">www.nhptv.org/natureworks/maskedbooby.htm</a></cite></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><cite><a href=\"http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/607/_/Masked_Booby.aspx\">http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/607/_/Masked_Booby.aspx</a></cite></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anderson, W.G. 1954.

It also has the most variable plumage of any New Zealand shag. The face, throat, breast and belly plumage range from completely black through to white, with a range of partial combinations in between. These pose a challenge to identification, at least until the observer becomes familiar with the little shag&#x2019;s diagnostic short-billed and long-tailed silhouette, along with its small size and stubby yellow bill. Shape alone is sufficient to identify a little shag.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The little shag is a small shag that exhibits bewildering plumage variation. Most adults are black with white cheeks and throat, a colour morph sometimes referred to as a &#x2018;white-throated shag&#x2019;. At the other extreme, 8-60% of adults (depending on location) have completely white underparts, from face to undertail, indistinguishable from the little pied shags/cormorants of Australia. &#x2018;Intermediate morph&#x2019; or &#x2018;smudgy&#x2019; are terms used for about 5% of birds that have white faces and throats and variegated patches of black and white on the breast and belly. All three morphs develop a crest during the breeding season. The bill is short, stout and yellow, dark on the ridge. The eye is brown, and facial skin yellow. Legs and feet are black. The pied morph of the little shag is more common in the north of New Zealand. In 1987, white-breasted birds made up 60% of the population in the Far North, 32% in Auckland, 15% in the rest of the North Island, but just 8% in the South Island, where the white-throated morph is predominant.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first plumage of juveniles is either white-breasted or entirely black. Examples of each type can be present in the same nest where the adults are of different plumage forms. The all-black fledglings develop a white throat after becoming independent and until then can be confused with little black shags (but note differences in bill colour and shape). Further variation is added by birds with stained white feathers, appearing orange-breasted. This may be due to iron-staining and persists for an extended period, for example throughout the nesting period of a recognised individual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All little shags have relatively longer tails than black, pied and little black shags. When flying or roosting with wings held out, their wings are also shorter and broader than these three other &#x2018;black-footed&#x2019; shag species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: silent except at nesting colonies, where males give characteristic bi- or tri-syllabic &#x2018;cooing&#x2019; sounds during courtship displays. A greeting call, consisting of a series of notes, <em>uh, uh, uh, uh, </em>fading away, is used by both sexes when approaching the nest to change over or to bring food.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: black shag, pied shag, and little pied shag all have plumage that is similar to one of the patterns seen in adult or juvenile little shag colour morphs. In all ages and plumages, little shags can be distinguished from these three other species by their small size combined with a short, stout yellow bill and relatively long tail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little shags are widespread in both coastal and freshwater habitats that include lakes, rivers, ponds and streams. They sometimes feed in ditches and small patches of shallow water, which may account for the tendency to acquire stained plumage. Vagrant birds have been recorded from Chatham, Snares, Auckland and Campbell Islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little shags are reported to be on the increase in Wellington Harbour and southern parts of the North Island, but have decreased markedly in the Auckland region where some colonies have disappeared since the 1980s or fallen below 10 pairs. Published estimates of 5000-10,000 pairs nationally may overstate the abundance of this species, but it is common throughout the country.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The main threat to the little shag appears to be depletion of its prey species, particularly by pollution or habitat degradation. A well-established colony at Hobson Bay, Auckland, studied during the 1980s and 90s died out despite most broods yielding 1-3 fledglings. Take-over of nest sites by the larger pied shags was a detrimental factor but not the only cause. As for other shag species, little shags are vulnerable to capture in recreational or commercial fishing nets, particularly unattended set-nets. The conservation status of this species was moved from &apos;at risk - naturally uncommon&apos; to &apos;not threatened&apos; in 2013.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little shags nest in trees over-hanging water and also on ledges or sea cliffs, forming colonies alone or with other shag species, especially pied shags. In mixed colonies, pied shags make large stick nests occupying open sites, whereas the nests of little shags tend to be built of thinner twigs and to be hidden in the foliage. Nests may be no more than one metre apart and are sometimes reused. Some little shags begin nesting in July or August, while others join the colony later and breeding can extend to April or May. Peak activity occurs in October-December. Up to 5 eggs may be laid from which 1-3 chicks are raised. Little shag nestlings begin life with bare black skin, black bill, and pink scalp and throat. A black downy stage follows, during which the scalp is bald and the salmon pink throat pouch is conspicuous. Feathers grow through the down and the young remain in or near the nest until ready to fly.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little shags are generally solitary when feeding (cf. the flock-feeding little black shag), although small groups may occur where birds are attracted to a food source or a convenient perch. Elaborate bowing courtship displays are given by males at or near the nest. Breeding colonies range in size from 5 to over 200 pairs.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Small fish, eels and crustaceans; also frogs, tadpoles and insects. Little shags generally forage alone, making a succession of shallow dives around 20 seconds long. Chicks are fed by regurgitation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Pied_Cormorant\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Pied_Cormorant</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It usually forages alone. Even though readily seen about harbours and estuaries associated with cities or towns, black shags are wary of close approach by people, probably as a result of persecution by fishers and waterfowl hunters. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A large black shag with black-brown wings and tail, and white-cream feathering over cheeks and throat. The skin about the eyes and base of bill is yellow, feet and legs black, bill grey, and eyes green. Adults early in the breeding cycle have the skin below eyes red-orange, white thigh patches, a small black crest on nape and upper neck, and variable amounts of white filoplumes on the crown and upper neck. Juveniles and immatures have black-brown plumage, which fades to sandy brown, and have variable amounts of white on foreneck, breast and abdomen, from none to extensive. Their facial skin is yellow, and eyes grey-brown turning to green.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: generally quiet away from nest. At the nest a variety of calls with marked sexual differences, males having a range of loud raucous sounds, females soft and husky sounds early in the breeding cycle but becoming more like those of males during incubation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: little black shag is smaller, more slender with very thin bill and without yellow facial skin. White-throated morph of little shag is much smaller with a short stubby yellowish bill. Juveniles and immatures of black shag can be difficult to distinguish from similar sized juveniles and immatures of pied shag. Both can have underparts nearly all brown to nearly all white; latter have paler face, sides of neck and throat (black shag mainly dark head and upper throat), and lack yellowish facial skin. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The black shag is almost cosmopolitan in distribution, being present in Australasia, Eurasia, Iceland, Africa, the northeast coast of North America and Greenland. It is widespread throughout New Zealand, although sparsely so. It is found from Northland to Stewart Island, and on many offshore and some outlying islands, including the Chatham Islands. It is a vagrant to Macauley Island (Kermadec Islands), and the subantarctic Snares, Auckland and Campbell Island groups. Black shags are found in a variety of habitats, including coastal waters, estuaries, harbours, rivers, streams, lakes and ponds, including up to the subalpine zone. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While counts of black shags, along with other wetland species, have been undertaken at a few harbours and lakes, no attempt has been made to carry out a national count of the species or to locate all colonies and determine the number of nesting pairs. However, the population in 2012 was estimated to number 5000-10,000 mature individuals. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Black shags were persecuted for decades by fishers who believed that they ate large numbers of trout. While few black shags are shot these days, it still occurs occasionally. The eggs and nestlings of tree-nesting black shags seem not to be preyed upon by possums, rats and stoats. However, the species is sensitive to disturbance by people and will leave nests when closely approached. Black shags swallow fish on broken-off portions of snagged fishing lines. If the lines come free, some birds are found dead with hooks penetrating the gut, or caught up at tree roosts by sinkers or hooks from these lines. Set-nets left unattended in estuaries and harbours occasionally result in black shags drowning. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Timing of nesting by black shags depends on whether the colony is at a coastal or inland site, and whether it is a pair&#x2019;s first nest of the season or a replacement for an earlier failed attempt. Therefore, while most pairs lay clutches in autumn-winter, it is possible to find black shags nesting in any month. Colonies occur on trees or shrubs, on the ground in swamps, coastal cliffs and headlands, and on artificial structures. Nests, often used repeatedly over several years, are mostly made of sticks, twigs and foliage. Clutch size is typically 3-5 eggs. Both members of the pair incubate the eggs and care for the young. Chicks start flying at 7-8 weeks of age, and continue to be fed by their parents for a further 5-11 weeks. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While a few juveniles disperse widely (one banded at a Lake Wairarapa colony was recovered on Lord Howe Island), adults tend to remain year-round within a few kilometres of where they nest. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Generally black shags feed alone, but they occasionally form into flocks to forage cooperatively where prey is abundant. They sometimes forage in highly turbid waters, and even forage at night in mid-winter at high latitudes. Black shags have also been recorded wading in shallow streams searching for prey under pebbles. They forage mainly in water less than 3 m deep, dives averaging 21 seconds, with 7 seconds between dives. Black shags have poor aquatic visual acuity, and so may locate prey by touch using the bill (prey-flushing strategy) or detect prey visually at very short distances, and then possibly rely on the rapid extension of their long necks to capture food without an energetically expensive pursuit. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Black shags mainly consume small and medium-sized fish (&lt; 35 cm long) of a variety of species, both pelagic and benthic. Common prey species in New Zealand waters include mullet, carp, red cod, spotties, smelt, eels, bullies, galaxids, trout and perch. They also take freshwater crayfish, large invertebrates, molluscs and ducklings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Cormorant\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Cormorant</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kawau.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kawau.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gill, B.J.; Bell, B.D.; Chambers, G.K.; Medway, D.G.; Palma, R.L.; Scofield, R.P.; Tennyson, A.J.D.; Worthy, T.H. 2010. <em>Checklist of the birds of New Zealand, Norfolk and Macquarie Islands, and the Ross Dependency, Antarctica</em>.

In regions where it occurs, it can usually be readily seen about harbours and estuaries associated with cities or towns. Unlike most other shag species, the pied shag is reasonably confiding, allowing close approach when roosting or nesting in trees. It generally forages alone, but occasionally in small groups when prey is abundant.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pied shags mainly inhabit coastal habitats about much of New Zealand. Adults have the crown, back of the neck, mantle, rump, wings, thighs and tail black, although on close inspection the upper wing coverts are grey-black with a thin black border. The face, throat, sides of neck and underparts are white. The long, hooked beak is grey, the iris is green, and legs and feet black. On breeding adults, the skin in front of the eye is yellow, at the base of beak is pink or pink-red, and the eye-ring is blue. Non-breeding adults have paler skin colours than breeders. The upperparts of juveniles and immatures have dark and pale brown tones. Their underparts are white but with varying amounts of brown mottling, from almost entirely brown to little at all. The skin in front of eye is pale yellow, at the base of the beak is grey - pale pink, and eye-ring is grey.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: generally silent away from nesting colonies, but quite vocal at colonies during pair formation, nest building and when one of a pair returns to nest during incubation. Females give wheezy <em>haa</em> calls, while males give a variety of loud calls, that may be repeated several times, and that sound like <em>aark</em>, <em>kerlick</em> and <em>whee-eh-eh-eh</em>. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the pied morph of the little shag is much smaller and has a short stubby yellow beak. Both the king shag and pied morph of the Stewart Island shag have black heads with white throats, patches of white feathers on the upper wings, and pink feet. Juveniles and immatures of black shag can be difficult to distinguish from the similar-sized juveniles and immatures of pied shag. Both can have underparts from nearly all brown to nearly all white. Juvenile black shags have dark heads and upper throat, and have extensive yellowish facial skin about base of the beak, whereas the yellow is only in front of the eye on the pied shag. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The pied shag has a mainly coastal breeding distribution, occurring in three separate areas of New Zealand. Northern North Island: colonies on the western and eastern coasts of Northland and Auckland, and extending down to East Cape. Central New Zealand: Wellington, Nelson, Marlborough and Canterbury as far south as Banks Peninsula. Southern South Island: Fiordland and Stewart Island. Pied shags mainly forage in coastal marine waters, harbours and estuaries, but occasionally also in freshwater lakes and ponds close to the coast.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While counts of pied shags, along with other coastal species, have been undertaken in a few areas (Wellington Harbour, Marlborough Sounds), no attempt has been made to carry out a national count of the species or the number of pairs at all colonies. However, the population in 2012 was estimated to number 1000-5000 mature individuals. An examination of numbers of pairs at colonies during three periods (pre 1980, 1980-1999, post 1999), suggests that populations in the northern North Island and southern South Island are in decline, while those in central New Zealand are increasing (M. Bell pers. comm.). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are a variety of threats to pied shags. They were formerly occasionally shot by fishers who considered&#xA0;that they&#xA0;competed for fish; probably few pied shags are shot these days. Pied shags have drowned in craypots, set-nets and on inshore longlines. Some birds have been affected by oil spills, including following the grounding of the container ship <em>Rena</em> off Tauranga in October 2011. During the recent population expansion in central New Zealand, pied shags have established colonies in trees adjacent to peoples&#x2019; homes. The noise and smell of such colonies has resulted in a few nesting trees being felled. It is unknown whether changes in prey abundance as a result of commercial fishing or climate change, has impacted, positively or negatively, on the pied shag. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pied shags mainly nest in trees along coastal cliffs, with a few colonies in trees in or about freshwater lakes near the coast. There is one inland colony known, on Lake Hakanoa, Huntly. Clutches are laid in all months, with peaks during February-April and August-October. Clutch size is typically 2-5 eggs, and both sexes share incubation and care of young. Chicks start flying at 7-8 weeks of age, and remain at or near the colony to be fed by their parents for a further 10-11 weeks. Nearly 80% of nesting attempts at Makara Beach, Wellington, were successful, with a mean of 1.4 fledglings per nest.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Adult pied shags appear to be sedentary, but some juveniles disperse widely. When resting during the day, birds occur on undisturbed beaches, shoreline rocks, trees and artificial structures. During the late afternoon or evening, pied shags return to nesting colonies or favoured roosts in trees near water for the night. They are generally a solitary forager, but occasionally small groups gather where prey is readily available. When swimming slowly at the surface, they use&#xA0;alternate feet, but when foraging underwater they use both feet at the same time for propulsion. Pied shags generally forage in water less than 10 m deep. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No comprehensive studies of diet in New Zealand. Pied shags feed mainly on fish (6-15 cm long), and occasionally on crustaceans. Prey species include flounder, mullet, eel, goldfish, perch, goatfish, kahawai, wrasse and common trevally.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Pied_Cormorant\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Pied_Cormorant</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/piedshag.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/piedshag.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It breeds in northern central Siberia, and the bulk of the population spends the non-breeding season in northern Australia, with occasional birds reaching New Zealand. It is a bird of dry grasslands more than mudflats. In New Zealand, little whimbrels are often found in the same dry saltmarsh habitat as Pacific golden plovers, though not generally closely associated with the plovers. As most bird-watchers focus their attention on the large flocks of waders that assemble on mudflats and their high tide roosts, it is likely that many little whimbrels escape detection in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The little whimbrel is a medium-sized shorebird with a long neck, small head, upright stance, and long usually blue-grey legs. The first impression is of a miniature whimbrel with a shorter bill, and it is easy to see that it is related to other <em>Numenius</em> species. The little whimbrel is slightly larger than a Pacific golden plover, and noticeably smaller than a whimbrel or bar-tailed godwit. It has similar bold crown and supercilliary stripes to the whimbrel. The little whimbrel&#x2019;s slightly decurved bill is 40-50 mm long and mostly dark, but the base of the lower mandible is pinkish. It is longer and finer than for golden plover (and is decurved), but is much shorter and straighter than for whimbrel. The little whimbrel&apos;s upperparts are blackish and brown, fringed and notched with buff. The underparts are whitish buff.</p>\n<p>Voice: rising <em>te,te,te.</em></p>\n<p>Similar species: The once numerous, and very similar, eskimo curlew is probably extinct, and was never recorded in NZ, it was slightly larger and had cinnamon wing linings. Bristle-thighed curlew and whimbrel are much larger with much longer, more decurved bills. Upland sandpiper lacks the bold head stripes of little whimbrel and has a shorter, straight, yellow bill, yellow legs, and a much longer tail.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Little whimbrels breed in north and east Siberia. The majority of the population migrates in the northern autumn to the northern states of Australia, where it prefers short grassland. It is rated &#x201C;least concern&#x201D; by IUCN.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>Little whimbrels (usually a single bird) occur in New Zealand every year or two, where they have been seen on short grass or salt marsh, but also associating with godwits on tidal flats. Given their preference for grass it seems likely that others have come to New Zealand without being noticed. Those seen with godwits on tidal mudflats at Miranda have seemed unsettled and stayed for hours or less, rather than days.</p>\n<p>The first record for New Zealand was two birds at Lake Ellesmere in June 1900, followed by birds at the same site in March 1921, 1922 &amp; 1935, before the first North Island bird at Napier in 1952. Lake Ellesmere has continued to be a hot-spot for little whimbrel sightings, along with Manukau Harbour and Miranda. More exceptional were records from Browns Island, Hauraki Gulf (October 1996) and Nine Mile Beach, Charleston (September 2010).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Little whimbrels that migrate to northern Australia gather in flocks, sometimes of thousands, mostly in short, dry grasslands near fresh water, and marshes with short vegetation. They are often seen on mown grass such as sports fields and airfields. Flocks are very mobile and turn up unexpectedly, depending on grassland condition, rain etc.</p>\n<p>A vagrant little whimbrel observed on Norfolk Island for five consecutive mornings December 2004 - January 05, was always with Pacific golden plovers on grass [Kingston Common], and never with two whimbrels on a nearby mud, rock and sand beach a few metres away. That bird was seen to squat when startled.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Little whimbrels eat small insects from ant-size to crickets and grasshoppers, but also some seeds. They feed by picking or short probing, and will also bury their bill fully.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Curlew\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Curlew</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3007\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3007</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Chandler, R. 2009. <em>Shorebirds of the northern hemisphere</em>.

The whimbrel has a brown-and-white barred underwing without the orange tones of the bristle-thighed curlew. Whimbrel rarely shows as much pink on the bill as bristle-thighed curlew, and usually has more streaking and barring on the underparts. Whimbrel also has a very different call (a seven note whistle: <em>ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti</em>). Far-eastern curlew is larger with proportionately much longer bill and no crown stripe. Little whimbrel has a crown stripe but bill is finer and only slightly down curved.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Bristle-thighed curlews breed in two separate tundra areas in western Alaska &#x2013; the Seward Peninsula and the Nulato Hills, Yukon delta. They migrate to spend the non-breeding season on Pacific islands ranging from northwest Hawaiian Islands, through the Marshall and Gilbert Islands to the Marquesas and Tuamotu. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population is estimated at 10,000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There have been 3 New Zealand records, all from the Kermadec Islands: Macauley Island (August 1966), North Meyer Islet (September 1972 &#x2013; a dried corpse now in Te Papa), and Raoul Island (September 1972).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The main threats to bristle-thighed curlews are in the non-breeding areas on Pacific islands.

But there is nothing nondescript about the migrations of bar-tailed godwits. They perform the longest nonstop flights of any non-seabird, and, unlike a seabird, there is no chance of an inflight snack.</p>\n<p>Godwits hold cultural significance for many New Zealanders. For Maori they were birds of mystery, (&#x2018;<em>Kua kite te kohanga kuaka?</em> <em>Who has seen the nest of the kuaka?&#x2019;</em><em>)</em> and were believed to accompany spirits of the departed; but they were also a source of food. They are the most numerous tundra-breeding shorebird species to occur in New Zealand, with around 75,000 here each year. Virtually all New Zealand birds are from the <em>baueri </em>subspecies breeding in western Alaska. &#xA0;They are relatively common at many harbours and estuaries around the country. Following the breeding season, birds generally begin arriving from early September, usually after a non-stop 8-9 days flight. They begin departing on northern migration from early March, heading for refuelling sites around the Yellow Sea. They do not breed until their third or fourth year, so each southern winter there are hundreds of non-breeding birds remaining in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The bar-tailed godwit is the most common Arctic migrant in New Zealand. It is a large long-legged wader, predominantly brown above, pale below, with a long tapering and slightly upturned bi-coloured bill, pink at the base and black towards the tip. Males are markedly smaller with shorter bills than females. While some overlap in size and bill-length does occur, most of the time sexes can be separated in the field. In non-breeding plumage both sexes alike: crown and hind neck pale brown with dark streaks; scapulars and coverts brown with dark centres and pale fringes giving streaked appearance; lower back, rump and tail barred with brown. Underparts pale with grey-brown wash and fine streaking on neck and flanks. In flight uniform colour and pattern, wing stripe often indistinct; feet partly project beyond tail. In breeding plumage most males undergo a complete transformation, becoming bright rufous on the head, neck, breast and belly, with strongly contrasting upperparts &#x2013; dark feathers with buff fringes and notches. Females are considerably less colourful, becoming strongly streaked and barred on neck, breast and flanks, sometimes with pale rufous wash. Juveniles that have recently arrived in New Zealand are recognisable by the broader buff margins to their scapular and back feathers, making them appear more mottled than adults; this plumage is rapidly moulted and replaced.</p>\n<p>Voice: godwits most commonly call in flight, usually&#xA0; <em>a-wik,a-wik,a-wik. </em>For most of their time in New Zealand they are usually silent on the ground, but immediately before migration departures there is a notable increase in both frequency and volume of calls from individuals that are about to leave.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Similar species: black-tailed godwit and Hudsonian godwit are both smoother grey-brown on the back, have&#xA0;prominent white-and-black wingbars, and a white rump contrasting with their black tail. The bill is slightly upturned in Hudsonian godwit, but is straight in black-tailed godwit. Whimbrels are slightly darker, with striped heads and down-curved bills.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Eastern bar-tailed godwits breed in western Alaska and migrate to New Zealand and eastern Australia. They are widely distributed around the country and some birds may occur on almost any harbour or estuary, although the bulk of the population occur at larger sites: Parengarenga, Kaipara, Manukau, Firth of Thames, and Farewell Spit. Other good sites include Rangaunu, Whangarei,&#xA0;Tauranga, Ohiwa, Kawhia, Porongahau, Foxton Beach, Tasman and Golden&#xA0; Bays, Avon-Heathcote,&#xA0; Blueskin Bay, and Invercargill Estuary/Awarua Bay. Bar-tailed godwits predominantly forage on soft intertidal substrates but may also be found probing in wet pasture.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The population of subspecies <em>baueri</em> (eastern bar-tailed godwit ) is likely less than 150,000 birds, 75,000 of which occur in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Bar-tailed godwits are fully protected in New Zealand. Current count data indicates an annual population decline of nearly 2%, the primary driver of which is extensive habitat loss at staging areas in the Yellow Sea region.&#xA0;Godwits tend to be wary and easily spooked, and so preventing or minimising disturbance at high tide roost sites is an important conservation consideration. As with other migratory species using the East Asian Australasian Flyway, bar-tailed godwits face a real and potent threat from habitat loss, particularly at critical migration stopover sites in the Yellow Sea region. They are subjected to subsistence harvest by indigenous people in Alaska, but the number of birds taken is probably minimal. Predicted Global Climate Change is likely to affect birds at all stages of their annual cycle. &#xA0;Expansion of shrubs and trees into tundra regions is likely to reduce suitable breeding habitat. Earlier peak invertebrate emergence in response to temperature changes may lead to major disruption of breeding strategy: that is, peak food supply may have occurred before hatching. Utilising suitable wind patterns is a key component of godwit migration strategies, so changes to synoptic weather patterns on migration routes is likely to pose major problems for these birds. Rising sea levels will greatly reduce intertidal foraging habitat at wintering, staging and post-breeding sites. The conservation status of this species was changed to At Risk, Declining in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding </strong></p>\n<p>Eastern bar-tailed godwits breed on upland and coastal tundra on the western rim of Alaska, from the coast to up to 200 km inland, from the Gulf of Alaska to North Slope. A clutch of four eggs is laid in a shallow bowl often lined with lichen. Each egg is approximately 11% of a female&#x2019;s body mass. The pay-off for these huge eggs is fully developed and mobile chicks at hatching.&#xA0;Parents share incubation and brooding post-hatching, but one parent may depart for the migration staging area earlier. Young fledge after 28-30 days. Juveniles arrive in New Zealand after their first trans-Pacific flight when barely four months old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Bar-tailed godwits forage over the intertidal zone at low tide &#x2013; either individually dispersed or in loose formations. They congregate in flocks at high tide roosts, but can be extremely wary birds, often difficult to closely approach at New Zealand sites. In parts of Auckland, flocks are commonly seen commuting between the Manukau and Waitemata Harbours. Migration departures are staggered through March, in flocks varying between less than ten birds to over a hundred. Individual birds have their own departure schedule and will aim to leave within the same 3-4 day window each year. Time of departure from New Zealand is determined by a bird&#x2019;s destination: birds leaving in early March breed in more southern areas of western Alaska while birds leaving in late March breed north of the Brooks Range. Snow cover which clears in southern areas from early May but not until the beginning of June in the north explains these staggered departures. Post-breeding adults and juvenile birds congregate along the southern coast of the Alaskan Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta preparing for southward migration. Birds tracked by satellite on their 11,000-12,000 km flights to New Zealand took 8-9 days, with an average flight speed of 56 kph.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>On non-breeding grounds bar-tailed godwits mainly eat polychaetes (probably over 70% of diet) but also small bivalves and crustaceans. They also forage in wet pasture for terrestrial&#xA0; invertebrates.</p>\n<p>On breeding grounds, they consume cranefly larvae and other invertebrates, and some berries, particularly soon after arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-tailed_Godwit\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-tailed_Godwit</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wading-birds/page-7\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wading-birds/page-7</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kuaka.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kuaka.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/sfc315.pdf\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/sfc315.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3005\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3005</a></p>\n<p><a title=\"The Flight of the Godwit &#x2013; Science Express on Te Papa Channel\" href=\"http://channel.tepapa.govt.nz/audio/the-flight-of-the-godwit/\">The Flight of the Godwit &#x2013; Science Express on Te Papa Channel</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Battley, P.F.; Warnock, N.; Tibbitts, T.L.; Gill, R.E.

The Asiatic sub-species of black-tailed godwit, <em>melanuroides,</em> migrates from north-east Asia to wintering grounds in tropical Asia and Australia, with a small number annually over-shooting and reaching New Zealand. Here, they are mainly found at sites that hold large flocks of bar-tailed godwits, but the black-tailed godwits often keep to themselves, or prefer the company of pied stilts.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The black-tailed godwit is a large greyish wader with a long, straight, bi-coloured bill, long black legs and long wings. On the ground it looks very similar to the bar-tailed godwit, which is an abundant wader on most New Zealand estuaries. However, the black-tailed godwit has a slimmer profile, a straighter bill and smooth greyish upperparts and breast which appear subtly different to the browner and more &#x201C;scaly&#x201D; upperpart feathering of bar-tailed godwits. Identification is easily confirmed when a bird stretches or takes flight. The distinctive black tail and white rump of the black-tailed godwit becomes very obvious and quite different to the brownish-barred tail and mottled rump of the bar-tailed godwit. Likewise the broad white wing-bar contrasting with dark-tipped primary and secondary feathers is very conspicuous and allows a single black-tailed godwit to be spotted even when flying in the midst of a large bar-tailed godwit flock. The underwings of the two are quite different as well, with the black-tailed godwit having a white underwing, compared to the heavily barred brown-and-white underwing of eastern bar-tailed godwits. In breeding plumage (seen mainly in March and April), the neck, breast and belly become mottled with a chestnut-red wash and an intricate pattern of black and white barring.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Hudsonian godwit is the American form of the black-tailed godwit. It differs in having a diagnostic dark underwing (particularly the inner wing) and having a smaller white bar on the upperwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Asiatic black-tailed godwits breed in scattered pockets across eastern Siberia, Kamchatka Peninsula, Mongolia and north-east China. They have a more temperate breeding range than other godwits and prefer damp grasslands and marshes. After breeding, they migrate in large numbers to India, South-east Asia and northern Australia where they occur on estuarine habitats as well as on inland lakes, flooded grasslands, freshwater wetlands and ricefields. The global population of black-tailed godwit is estimated at over 700,000 birds with the Asiatic sub-species numbering about 160,000. A tiny number, usually only 1-2, and rarely more than 10, reach New Zealand annually.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand Records</strong></p>\n<p>The black-tailed godwit was first recorded in New Zealand in 1952 at Miranda (Firth of Thames) and subsequently recorded from many mainland localities as well as the Chatham Islands and Auckland Islands (twice). In New Zealand they tend to occur on estuarine and coastal lake habitats and are usually seen in the company of pied stilts or bar-tailed godwits. Occasionally small flocks have been recorded, including 6 at Miranda (1963), 3-8 at the Avon-Heathcote Estuary (1985-1988), and 11 at Lake Ellesmere (1985).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In the non-breeding season, black-tailed godwits are gregarious and usually form large flocks. In New Zealand, birds tend to stay together in tightly-knit groups, or if a lone bird is present, it will usually attach itself to a flock of pied stilts or less often to a flock of bar-tailed godwits. Individuals may spend several years in one locality, either returning each new migration season or sometimes staying year round and apparently not migrating at all. Occasional birds exhibit reverse moult cycles in New Zealand, having bright red breeding plumage during the southern summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>In estuarine habitats, black-tailed godwits forage mainly by probing to catch marine worms, shellfish and crabs. On grasslands they forage for earthworms, fly larvae and other insects.

The Hudsonian godwit is a North American species that undertakes a long-distance migration from the Arctic to southern South America. A small number migrate in the wrong direction, reaching Australasia and the Pacific Islands in very small numbers. Here they are mainly found among large flocks of bar-tailed godwits. Very occasionally they can be seen alongside the very similar black-tailed godwit (also a vagrant species in New Zealand). These two &#x2018;black-tailed&#x2019; godwits mainly differ in the colour of their underwing, which is diagnostically dark (almost black) in Hudsonian godwit.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Hudsonian godwit is a large greyish-brown wader with a long, slightly upcurved , bi-coloured bill; long black legs and long wings. In winter plumage it is greyish-brown above and white below and looks very similar to the common bar-tailed godwit and almost identical to the slightly more numerous black-tailed godwit. In breeding plumage it has dark upperparts spotted with white, and rich chestnut-red underparts with an intricate pattern of black and white barring on the belly and flanks. Hudsonian godwits are easily identified when they stretch and lift their wings. The pattern of black tail, conspicuous white rump and broad white wing bar contrasting with darker wing feathers separates them instantly from the drab brown bar-tailed godwits. To distinguish Hudsonian godwits from black-tailed godwits the under-sides of the wing must be clearly seen &#x2013; the forward part of the underwing is blackish in Hudsonian godwit but white in black-tailed godwit.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Hudsonian godwits breed in coastal or riverine wet meadows and marshland in Alaska, north-west Canada and Hudson Bay. After breeding, they undertake a rapid long-distance migration to Argentina and Chile and are rarely seen elsewhere in the Americas. In the non-breeding season they prefer estuaries, coastal wetlands and wet grassland. The global population of black-tailed godwit is estimated at c.70,000 birds. A tiny number, usually less than 3 birds, reach New Zealand annually.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The Hudsonian godwit was first recorded in New Zealand in 1902 at Lake Ellesmere and has subsequently been recorded from many localities throughout the country, including Chatham Island and Campbell Island. In New Zealand they tend to occur on inter-tidal mudflats and coastal lakes and usually associate with bar-tailed godwits. Occasionally two birds will occur together but the vast majority of sightings in New Zealand are of lone birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In New Zealand, Hudsonian godwits tend to forage and roost amongst flocks of bar-tailed godwits where they go un-noticed until an individual raises its wings or takes flight. Their feeding behaviour is much like that of their far more abundant cousin, where they walk over mudflats, wade in shallow water and find most of their prey by deep probing in soft sediment.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>In estuarine habitats Hudsonian godwits feed mainly on marine worms, shellfish and crabs. On grasslands they forage for earthworms and insect larvae.

It breeds on grasslands in North America and winters in similar habitats throughout South America. It is a very rare vagrant to New Zealand, with a single record from the Manukau Harbour in 1967.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The upland sandpiper is warm-brownish streaked medium-sized wader with an erect stance. It has a small pigeon-like head, large dark eye on an unmarked buffy face, long neck and a disproportionately long, barred tail. The underparts are white with dark brown chevrons on the breast merging into barring on the flanks. The underwings are barred black-and-white, and are often held extended up when the bird lands, particularly on elevated perches (e.g. fence posts) on its breeding grounds. The upperwings are plain brown, with darker primaries (no wingbar). The bill is straight and yellowish, and the legs long and greenish-yellow. The <em>Tringa</em>-like upright posture; small, bland-looking head and straight, thin bill are characteristic of upland sandpiper. In New Zealand, upland sandpiper should be looked for in similar habitats as Pacific golden plover.</p>\n<p>Voice: whistles usually heard only on breeding grounds.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the buff-breasted sandpiper (not yet recorded from New Zealand, but multiple records from Australia) is chunkier, with shorter, brighter yellow legs, and shorter bill and tail, as well as having bright white underwings. Little whimbrel has a striped head, down-curved bill, dark legs and shorter tail. Pacific golden plover has a larger head, thicker, darker bill, shorter tail and plain underwings. Ruff has longer, darker bill, smaller eye, shorter tail, lacks chevrons and barring on its underparts, and has a plain white underwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>This American species occurs in the Pacific only as a rare vagrant. Although its preferred habitat is grasslands, a wide variety of grassland types is utilised.</p>\n<p><strong>Population&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The overall population of upland sandpiper is stable, and is estimated at around 350,000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The only New Zealand record was a single bird at Karaka, Manukau Harbour, in February 1967. The only other record from the western Pacific is a specimen taken near Sydney in 1848 and now in the Australian Museum.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>In its native range, the main threat to upland sandpipers is conversion of grasslands to livestock and grain production.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_Sandpiper\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_Sandpiper</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/upland_sandpiper/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/upland_sandpiper/id</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The wandering tattler is the rarer of the two in New Zealand. It is a familiar bird on many of the islands of the tropical Pacific, but does not reach New Zealand every year. In contrast, there are 5-10 grey-tailed tattlers present most years, as an overflow from the large population that spends the non-breeding season in northern Australia. The two species have marked, but not absolute, habitat preferences, with wandering tattlers mainly found on rocky headlands and wave platforms, and grey-tailed tattlers more often on soft substrates in harbours and estuaries. One of the best ways to tell the two apart are from their loud calls given in flight &#x2013; a rippling <em>pew-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu</em> by the wandering tattler, and an up-slurred <em>too-wheet</em> by the grey-tailed tattler.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The wandering tattler is a medium-sized, straight-billed wader with a dark grey upper body and upper breast, with dense grey barring on the white underparts in breeding plumage. In non-breeding plumage this changes to a more uniform grey breast and flanks with white lower breast and belly. Short white eyebrow stripes do not extend past the eye, but often meet on the forehead. These lie above dark loral stripes, which contrast with narrow white eye-rings. The bill is dark grey grading into dull yellow at the base. The legs are yellow and of medium length. The very long wings give the bird an attenuated rear end, adding to its graceful profile. Wandering tattlers often teeter or bob when feeding.</p>\n<p>Voice: a whistled, rippling trill of 6-10 syllables, often against a background of breaking surf.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the very similar grey-tailed tattler is best distinguished by its 2-syllable call. Other more subtle differences include overall paler grey plumage of the grey-tailed tattler, less barring on underparts in breeding plumage (the belly and undertail coverts remain white), longer white eyebrows extending behind the eye and not meeting on the forehead, and shorter wings not extending much beyond the tail. Grey-tailed tattler also has a shorter nasal groove on the bill (less than half the bill length, cf. more than half in wandering tattler), and 4 or fewer primary tips extending beyond the tertials on the folded wing (cf. 5 in wandering tattler).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat </strong></p>\n<p>Wandering tattlers breed in Siberia, Alaska and north-west Canada and migrate south to Pacific islands and Australia and (rarely) New Zealand. Birds also migrate south down the Pacific Coast of America.</p>\n<p>Wandering tattlers are typically birds of exposed, rocky coasts, with reefs or rock platforms rather than mudflats.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records </strong></p>\n<p>The wandering tattler is a rare visitor to New Zealand with far fewer records than for grey-tailed tattler. Mainland records extend from Spirits Bay (Far North) to Brooklands Lagoon (Canterbury), with several records from the Kaikoura and Marlborough coasts. Both species of tattlers have occurred on wave platforms on Kaikoura Peninsula, and so all distinguishing characters need to be checked. Offshore and outlying island records are from Raoul, Macauley and Curtis Islands (Kermadec Islands), and Cuvier, Red Mercury and Portland Islands, Chatham and Rangatira Islands (Chatham Islands) and Enderby Island (Auckland Islands).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The wandering tattler is a long-distance migrant.

New Zealand is well south of its usual wintering range and consequently the species is seldom recorded here. It is likely however that many common sandpipers go undetected in this country as they occur in a wide range of wetland habitats, both coastal and inland, and do not favour estuarine mudflats as most migratory waders and therefore birdwatchers do.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The common sandpiper is a medium-sized sandpiper with nondescript dark greyish-brown plumage above and white below. The most distinguishing plumage feature is a white shoulder &#x201C;tab&#x201D; which separates the grey breast from the front of the closed wings. This gives the impression that the bird is wearing a bib. Other useful identification features are a white eye-ring, a black eye-stripe, pale eyebrow, and a brownish bill approximately the same length as the head. In flight the upper surface of the wing is brownish with a prominent white wing-bar which extends from the primary feathers into the secondaries and reaches the body. The underwing is mainly white. At rest, the tail extends well beyond the folded wings. The legs are dull greenish-grey.</p>\n<p>Voice: the flight call is a distinctive <em>hee-dee-dee</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the common sandpiper is most similar to three species that have not been recorded from New Zealand: spotted sandpiper (<em>T. macularia</em>), green sandpiper (<em>T. ochropus</em>) and wood sandpiper (<em>T. glareola</em>). Spotted sandpiper is the North American sister species, and is very similar to common sandpiper when in &#x2018;unspotted&#x2019; non-breeding plumage. Spotted sandpiper could reach New Zealand and so all sightings of common sandpiper need careful scrutiny to determine the correct identity of the bird. Distinguishing characters include spotted sandpiper having a reduced wingbar, not reaching the body, and a shorter tail, not extending much beyond the folded wings. Green and wood sandpipers do not have the white tab in front of the folded wing. Green sandpiper has a white rump and dark underwing. Wood sandpiper has a more prominent white eyebrow, and longer, yellower legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The common sandpiper breeds across Europe, central and northern Asia east to Japan. Its global population is estimated at over two million birds. During the non-breeding season it is found throughout Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, south and south-eastern Asia, Philippines, New Guinea and Australia. Within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the common sandpiper is considered the most widely distributed shorebird species, but the southern limits of its regular migration are the southern coastlines of Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The common sandpiper is a rare visitor to New Zealand. Since the first verified record in 1964 there have been less than eight records per decade, with the vast majority in the North Island. There have been&#xA0;eight South Island records and one sighting on Stewart Island. All records in New Zealand have been of single birds on a range of habitats including tidal riverbanks, braided riverbeds, brackish lagoons and oxidation ponds.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Generally solitary in the non-breeding season, common sandpipers tend to avoid flocks of other waders on estuarine mudflats and high tide roosts. Instead they visit a wide range of freshwater and brackish wetland habitats and a sizeable proportion of those reaching New Zealand no doubt occur at sites (such as riverbanks, rivermouth lagoons and farm ponds) that ornithologists seldom visit. They forage in shallow water and on muddy and stony substrates. They often bob their head and teeter their tail up and down as they walk about, exaggerating this action when they become wary of an approaching human or potential predator.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Common sandpipers consume aquatic and terrestrial insects and their larvae, worms, small crustaceans and molluscs.

They are less common in New Zealand than formerly. Up to six were recorded annually during OSNZ wader surveys in the late 1980s and early 1990s but none was recorded during the counts in the period 1994-2003 (although there were accepted records of birds in 1998 and 2002 that were missed during the surveys).

Single birds have been recorded in New Zealand on a dozen occasions since 1947, and since 2008 a single pair has bred in Northland. The nearest populations outside of New Zealand are in Australia and the islands of the Southwest Pacific. Some barn owls are thought to have flown to New Zealand from Australia, while others are known or presumed to have arrived as stowaways on aircraft and ships.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p>The barn owl is a very pale, medium-sized owl with a distinctive white, heart-shaped face, black eyes and a pale bill. Its crown, nape, back and upper-wings are orangey buff and grey, delicately marked with white spots. The throat, breast and belly are white below with some dark spots. The long legs are fully covered with white feathers, down to the greyish toes.</p>\n<p>Voice: a loud hissing screech. Recently fledged juveniles call more plaintive and higher pitched than adults.</p>\n<p>Similar species: there are no other medium-sized pale owls in New Zealand, and so the barn owl cannot be confused with the smaller darker native morepork and the even smaller little owl. The barn owl&#x2019;s loud hissing screech could possibly be confused with some brush-tailed possum vocalisations.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Barn owls are widespread on mainland Australia and on the islands of the Southwest Pacific.</p>\n<p>In New Zealand they have been recorded at scattered locations throughout the country, particularly on the West Coast. They have arrived in New Zealand by a variety of means, including as windblown stragglers, and on aircraft and ships. Evidence of captive-bred cage escapees near Auckland during the 1990s, and the ability of barn owls to disperse widely, makes it difficult to deduce the origin of the pair established near Kaitaia. The Kaitaia barn owls nest in open woodland within an open grass farmland matrix. Their surrounding habitat consists mainly of long kikuyu grass dairy pasture with numerous drains. The adults and fledglings have been observed roosting in the small stands of native trees in the vicinity of the nest tree and up to 6 km away. The current nest tree entrance is c.11 m above ground level in an old puriri tree.</p>\n<p>Recent reports to Wingspan include South Brighton (Christchurch), Hunua Ranges, Kumeu, Whenuapai, and across Northland. </p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records </strong></p>\n<p>There are thirteen records for New Zealand including the breeding pair near Kaitaia. Accepted records include: Barrytown 1947, Haast 1955, Rununga 1960, Papatoetoe 1983, Auckland International airport 1985, Hokitika 1988, Christchurch 1989, South Kaipara Heads 1990, New Plymouth 1991, Whenuapai 1992, Waikato 2001, Lyttelton 2001, and Kaitaia 2008.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Wire fences and vehicle collisions are likely to be a threat to barn owls in New Zealand. In Kaitaia a recently fledged barn owl was found with a broken wing probably caused by a collision with a wire fence, and an adult bird found dead with lacerations to its wing, likely the result of barbed wire. When caught out in daylight, the barn owls in Northland have been harassed by magpies. Other threats include intensive farming practices in the vicinity of the nest tree, domestic and feral cats, swamp harriers, possums and mustelids, and the use of anticoagulant rodenticides. Wingspan Birds of Prey Trust has erected 12 nest boxes in the area to provide potential nest and roost sites for offspring from the pair. Potential risks to endangered native bird species&#xA0;if barn owls establish and spread in New Zealand have not been assessed.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding </strong></p>\n<p>Barn owls in Australia can be prolific breeders with eggs found at any time of year. In New Zealand in April 2008, an injured, fledgling barn owl was found in the vicinity of a known pair of barn owls. In June 2008, two dead chicks were removed from the nest cavity. One of these chicks was estimated at c. 56 days old showing that the nest had been initiated in early March. From observations of this pair of barn owls over five years, it appears they have bred at least twice a year since 2008. Fledged chicks have been observed within the vicinity of the nest tree in April, June, July, August, November and January. The number of fledged chicks observed at this site at any one time has varied from three to four.</p>\n<p>The discovery of a second breeding pair of barn owls approximately 10 km from the first nest, along with recovery of five deceased barn owls in winter 2016 in Northland, and further reported sightings from the public, suggest that&#xA0;this species has an established and growing population&#xA0;in Northland. </p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology </strong></p>\n<p>In New Zealand, barn owls are mainly quiet and unobtrusive, but they are vocal during the breeding season when the male takes a prominent perch and gives an incessant screech for 15-20 minutes. Dependant juveniles are very vocal when the adults arrive with food. Foraging and roosting has been observed around cowsheds and poultry farms. Barn owls have a very buoyant flight and quarter over fields before hovering momentarily then dropping into long grass to seize their prey. They often perch on fence posts alongside grass roadside verges, listening for prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Barn owls are small rodent specialists but take birds also, depending on prey availability. Analysis of 18 pellets cast by the Kaitaia barn owls revealed they had consumed mice, rats and small birds, including house sparrow, greenfinch, yellowhammer, starling and a fernbird.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_Owl\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_Owl</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wingspan.co.nz/birds_of_prey_new_zealand_barn_owl.html\">http://www.wingspan.co.nz/birds_of_prey_new_zealand_barn_owl.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Falla, R.A. 1948.

Seven of the nine extant species are found in New Guinea, with species also found in north Maluku (Indonesia), Australia, and New Caledonia. The name owlet-nightjar derives from the owl-like forward-facing eyes set in a facial disk combined with a small beak, rictal bristles, and large gape reminiscent of nightjars. However, appearances can be deceptive and owlet-nightjars are not related to nightjars (Order Caprimulgiformes), but to swifts and hummingbirds (Order Apodiformes). The extinct New Zealand owlet-nightjar was most closely related to the New Caledonian species <em>Aegotheles savesi</em>. Together, these two species are considered to have separated from the owlet-nightjars tree long before any of the other surviving species.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand owlet-nightjar was the largest of all the owlet-nightjars. It is known only from isolated bones and partial skeletons, but reconstructions show the typical upright stance of the group. It is likely to have had a facial-disk and forward facing eyes, small bill with a large gape, relatively small wings, and long legs. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Found throughout the North and South Islands in forest or heavily wooded habitats.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand owlet-nightjar was probably extinct by the 13th Century due to predation by the Pacific rat (kiore, <em>Rattus exulans</em>) introduced when Polynesian settlers first arrived about a thousand years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No information, but extant species lay white eggs in cavity nests.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While the New Zealand owlet-nightjar had a well developed keel on the sternum, its relatively small wings and long legs indicate that it was either flightless or a poor flier. It is thought to have been nocturnal, spending most of its time foraging on the forest floor for insects and, possibly, frogs and small reptiles.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owlet-nightjar\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owlet-nightjar</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Clere, N. 2010. <em>Nightjars of the world</em>.

They have the&#xA0;big heads, long bills, and relatively small bodies and tails typical of the Southwest Pacific forest kingfishers to which they are related. They are native to eastern Australia and were introduced into Kawau Island, Hauraki Gulf, by Sir George Grey in 1866, and to Wellington, Nelson, and Otago between the 1860s and 1880. Only the Kawau population successfully established and subsequently colonised the adjacent mainland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unmistakable because of their large size and typical kingfisher shape. They have a pale head with dark brown ear-coverts, off-white underparts, brown back, and black-barred rufous tail, with blue on the rump and upper wing-coverts. The sexes are similar, but females tend to be larger. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kookaburras have a repertoire of different vocalisations including&#xA0;their famous laugh (<em>koo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ha-ha-ha-HA-HA-hoo-hoo-hoo</em>) which is a territory song usually heard at dawn or dusk throughout the year and delivered by a number of birds simultaneously. Individual birds repeat the song for between 5 and 8 seconds. Six shorter calls have been recorded relating to courtship, feeding, contact, and danger.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Found on Kawau Island, Hauraki Gulf, and the adjacent mainland east coast from the Whangarei district south to Kaukapakapa and Riverhead, and the southern Waitakere Ranges. Birds have also been recorded further north from the Bay of Islands. Sightings of single birds from elsewhere in the North Island (Cape Maria van Diemen, Waikato, Gisborne) and from the South Island (Westland, Otago) are regarded as vagrants, either from Northland or Australia. Kookaburras inhabit open wooded country and forest margins.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Scarce, with a restricted geographic range and a probable total population of under 500. The New Zealand population is thought to be stable.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The New Zealand population is too small and restricted to cause widespread ecological impacts, but kookaburras may have significant local impacts on small native passerines and particularly threatened geckos.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kookaburras are monogamous and mate for life. Breeding is cooperative with non-breeding family members helping in incubation, brooding, and feeding of young. In Australia this helping phase may last for up to four years. Kookaburras use nest holes which are often reused over many years. A clutch of 2-3 white eggs is laid between November and May. Larger clutch sizes in Australia are attributed to laying by female helpers. No information is yet available on breeding behaviour or success in New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kookaburras live in family groups and keep in visual and audible contact during the day, roosting together at night in a tall tree. They are strongly territorial. Kookaburras are &#x201C;perch-and-pounce&#x201D; predators. They sit on a prominent perch when foraging, often for long periods, until prey appears below when the bird pounces on it. It returns to its perch, where it often stuns the prey repeatedly until it is immobilised, when it is swallowed whole. Kookaburras are long lived, with individuals surviving for at least 12 years in the wild.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Australia snakes and reptiles form about one third of a kookaburra&#x2019;s diet, and the absence of snakes in New Zealand may well be a limiting factor in the expansion of this species. Its diet includes earthworms, snails, insects, freshwater crayfish, frogs, lizards, rats, mice, and small birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/introduced-land-birds/5\">www.teara.govt.nz/en/introduced-land-birds/5</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_kookaburra\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_kookaburra</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fry, C.H.; Fry, K.; Harris, A. 1999. <em>Kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers</em>.

These early images showed in detail the prey, the foraging skills and the development of chicks in the nest and as fledgings. Equally recognisable is the hunched silhouette waiting patiently on a powerline or other elevated perch over an estuary or mudflat which converts in a flash to a streak of green diving steeply to catch a prey item.</p>\n<p>Kingfishers are found widely in New Zealand in a wide range of habitats: the key ingredients are elevated observation posts to hunt from, banks or suitable&#xA0;standing trees&#xA0;to&#xA0;excavate nests in, and open or semi-open habitats which support a range of prey items.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>A distinctive bird with a green-blue back, buff to yellow undersides and a large black bill. It has a broad black eye-stripe from lores to ear-coverts, and a white collar in adults. The underparts vary with wear; orange buff to buff when fresh but fading to cream or white when worn. The bill is black with a narrow pale strip on the lower mandible; the iris is dark brown with a black orbital ring. The legs and feet are grey or pink-brown. There are slight difference between the sexes, with females greener and duller above. Immatures are duller, with buff feather edges on upper parts and brownish mottling on the chest and collar. The distinctive hunched silhouette on power-lines over water, and direct flight between perch and food and return to perch are characteristic. Flight swift and direct with rapid shallow wing beats interspersed with fast glides.</p>\n<p>Kingfishers have a wide range of unmusical calls, the most distinctive of which is the staccato &#x2018;<em>kek-kek-kek&#x2019; </em>territorial call.</p>\n<p>The distinctive green-blue back and cap along with heavy black bill distinguishes it from other species. </p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>Present on all three main islands and the Kermadec Islands. Vagrant to the Chatham Islands, and absent from the subantartic islands. Recorded in both coastal and inland freshwater habitats. Common on farmland with trees, and along river banks. Uncommon well inland and in mountainous regions. More frequently encountered in the North Island than in the southern South Island. </p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>A wide range of forest, river margins, farmland, lakes estuaries and rocky coastlines; anywhere where there is water or open country with adjacent elevated perches.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Common and widely distributed. Kingfishers congregate in coastal districts and lowlands during winter. They have benefited from the creation of artificial structures such as powerlines and posts beside and over estuaries. They have also probably benefited from forest clearance and the increased amount of forest edge habitat and the planting of exotics (willow &amp; poplar along rivers). Population densities have been measured at 0.75/km based on several road-based surveys in the North Island, and 0.106/km from the northern South Island. </p>\n<p>Kingfishers are occasionally caught by cats, and many are killed or stunned by flying into window glass. They have been considered a threat to goldfish, trout, domestic fowls and bees in the past, and were persecuted as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Nest sites are in a wide range of trees sites, cliffs, banks and cuttings. In all sites a nest chamber is excavated initially by repeatedly flying at the intended site and using the bill to chisel out dirt. Once a purchase point is created, the birds peck and scoop out the rest of the nesting tunnel and nest chamber. The nest is generally not lined, but regurgitations can accumulate. Incubation is shared,&#xA0;but predominantly by&#xA0;the female. Based on limited banding in Wellington, kingfishers appear to have high fidelity to breeding sites. The same burrow has been reported in use for 20 consecutive years, but it is not known how many birds were involved.</p>\n<p>Mating occurs in early September with nest building or refurbishment in October. Second clutches can be laid as late as February.</p>\n<p>Can be evicted by starlings, mynas and sparrows. Adults&#xA0;can be&#xA0;extremely aggressive in defending nesting site, strategies include repeated staccato calls from nearby perches, responses to calls by neighbouring pairs, and dive-bombing of birds (including other kingfishers) and mammals. </p>\n<p>Chicks are fed by both parents on food similar to the adult diet. At some sites small chicks were fed spiders and insects, with larger items of food such as fish included as the chicks grew. At other sites there was reported to be no difference in food size fed to chicks. Chicks are initially fed in the nest but as they grow they are called out to the entrance by the adult. Chicks are fed for 7-10 days after leaving the nest and then start to catch food for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Mostly recorded singly or in pairs. The breeding pair is the most normal social unit, only occasionally at the end of the breeding season will larger groups be observed. They are most conspicuous when roosting on powerlines along estuaries or coastal roads. Kingfishers will use a wide range of perches, including washing lines, fences stacked rocks etc. generally more than two metres above the ground. They rarely perch on the ground. In New Zealand, kingfishers migrate altitudinally, with those birds breeding inland at up to 700 m&#xA0;above sea level,&#xA0;moving to the coast in the winter. There is no direct data about internal migration; seasonal movements more relate to use of habitats and secondarily to movements between higher altitude nesting sites and winter coastal roosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>A wide range of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates are taken, mostly from the ground, depending on the habitat. Aerial foraging and foraging from flowers and/or leaves has been reported. Kingfishers have been recorded diving between 2 cm and 1 metre into water to take prey. In estuarine mudflats the diet is mainly small crabs. In freshwater habitats a range of tadpoles, freshwater crayfish and small fish are taken. In open country insects such as cicadas, beetles, stick insects and weta are caught, along with spiders and small vertebrates, including lizards, mice and small birds. Kingfishers return to a perch with their prey, where they batter larger items before consumption. Various hunting strategies have been reported where birds sally forth from a perch and return with prey, plunge either shallowly or deeply into water, or probe into rotten logs. Prey are swallowed whole and pellets of indigestible remains are regurgitated.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Andersen, M.J.;&#xA0;Shult, H.T.;&#xA0;Cibois, A.; Thibault, J-C.;&#xA0;Filardi, C.E.;&#xA0;Moyle, R.G. 2015.&#xA0;Rapid diversification and secondary sympatry in Australo-Pacific kingfishers (Aves: Alcedinidae:&#xA0;<em>Todiramphus</em>). <em>Royal Society Open Science&#xA0;</em><em>2</em>: 140375;&#xA0;DOI:&#xA0;10.1098/rsos.140375.</p>\n<p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>Field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Since the first known occurrence in the 1880s there have been more than twenty records, sometimes of several birds in a year. They have occurred throughout the North and South Islands, but Westland and the Far North have had more&#xA0;occurences than other areas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With a range of unusual vocalisations consisting of conspicuous grunts and chattering calls, dollarbirds are frequently heard before being seen.&#xA0;They are fairly large, about the size of a tui but much stouter,&#xA0;stocky with short legs, a short tail and a very big head with a flat crown. In adults, the head and breast are dark brown, and the throat is glossy bright blue. The body is greenish blue and the flight and tail feather dark blue. The bird&#x2019;s name is inspired by the pale blue patches near the wing tips that resemble &#x2018;silver dollars&#x2019;, which are very prominent in flight.&#xA0;The bill is large and bright orange-red in colour and the legs are almost as bright. Young birds are a little duller, have very little blue on the throat, and brownish legs and bill.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The flight pattern varies from slow and direct with deep wing beats to fast and manoeuvrable when feeding.

Birds return to the breeding areas from late September to November and depart from February to April. These migration periods coincide with the dates of most records in New Zealand, suggesting that they are usually travelling birds blown off course. Most New Zealand records have been from lightly wooded rural areas.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Accepted records include: Mikonui River mouth (February 1881); Parihaka, New Plymouth (autumn 1881); Piha (November 1881); Waiwhakaio River, New Plymouth (late 1881); near Hokitika (late 1882); Wairoa district, Northland (&#x201C;some specimens&#x201D; November 1892); Awatere (November 1894); Stoke (April 1895); Te Kao, Far North (early spring 1923); near Greymouth (1933); Great Barrier Island (1935); Havelock North (April 1956); Farewell Spit (April 1956); Tikitiki, East Coast (May 1956); Fortrose (March 1967); Waihue Valley, Dargaville (May 1971); Westhaven Inlet (March 1983); Blenheim (March 1983); Hokitika (April 1995); Pukenui (October 1996); Pukenui (October 2000); and Kaitaia 8 January 2002.

They mostly live in open woodland but also use pasture with scattered trees and suburban parks and gardens. They feed in the morning and especially in the evening, with a period of inactivity around the middle of the day. The main prey is large insects which are watched for from&#xA0;prominent perches, often a dead branch or sometimes a power pole, with the bird sitting motionless except for the turning head. Prey are caught on the wing after a quick and agile pursuit and may be taken over the canopy, in clearings or over water from low levels, occasionally from the ground, and also up to great heights. Dollarbirds sometimes engage in aggressive territorial disputes with other bird species whilst defending feeding perches. Nests are constructed in the hollows of trees (there are no New Zealand breeding records).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Large flying insects such as cicadas, beetles and moths.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It is one of only two surviving species within the ancient endemic New Zealand wren family. Riflemen are small forest-dwelling insectivores, and are constantly on the move, producing a characteristic &#x2018;wing-flicking&#x2019; while moving through the canopy and foraging up and down tree trunks. South Island riflemen are found throughout forests of the main divide, but are less common in the east of the South Island, and extinct on Stewart Island (apart from Codfish and Ulva Islands). The North Island rifleman survives as geographically isolated populations on North Island mountain ranges, with only three populations north of&#xA0;Kaimai Forest Park (Warawara Forest in Northland, and on Little Barrier and Tiritiri Matangi Islands).</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Riflemen are sexually dimorphic. Males are smaller than females and have&#xA0;bright green on the head and back. Females are mainly yellow-brown with darker speckles on the head and back. Both sexes have pale grey under-parts. The black bill is slender, pointed, and angled slightly upwards. Riflemen are very small birds with short wings and a very short tail and forage predominantly within the canopy and on tree-trunks.</p>\n<p>Voice: a short, simple, high frequency <em>zip</em>, <em>pip</em> or <em>chuck</em> produced by both sexes. The alarm call is a rapid high frequency decrescendo. Riflemen utter almost constant contact calls while foraging. Calls are produced at a high frequency often inaudible to people.</p>\n<p>Similar species: rock wren (South Island alpine areas only) is larger, with longer legs and a stouter bill that is not upturned.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Riflemen are found predominantly in mature forest, especially beech, kauri, kamahi and podocarp forest. They are now mainly confined to higher altitude forest throughout both the North and South Islands. Their distribution in the North Island is patchy, including throughout the eastern ranges south to the Rimutaka range and on the Central Plateau (including Pureora Forest Park and Tongariro National Park). Remnant populations are present in Warawara Forest (Northland), on Little Barrier Island and in Mount Egmont National Park. Riflemen are widespread throughout the west of the South Island, and also occur on Banks Peninsula and in the seaward Kaikoura ranges. They are recently extinct on Stewart, but survive on Codfish Island. Riflemen have been translocated to Ulva Island, Stewart Island, Cape Kidnappers,&#xA0;Tiritiri Matangi Island, and to A&apos;Deane&apos;s Bush, Hawke&apos;s Bay.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Riflemen occur at high densities throughout the eastern and southern ranges of the North Island (e.g. Urewera, Kaweka and Tararua ranges), and at lower densities in other remnant populations around the North Island. They are locally common in Nelson and in Marlborough and relatively widespread through the west of the South Island but in lower numbers in the east of the South Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Population declines and fragmentation of riflemen are considered likely to be related to habitat clearance initially, compounded by the impacts of introduced pest species, particularly stoats.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Riflemen breed from August through to February. They build enclosed spherical nests within existing cavities. A diverse range of cavity types are used for nesting. Pairs can raise up to two broods per season, with more attempted if any nests fail. The male does most of the nest building, and both sexes contribute to incubation, nestling and fledgling care. Incubation of the 2-5 eggs takes about 20 days, and chicks leave the nest when about 24 days old. Riflemen breed in cooperative family groups in both sub-species, where related offspring of both sexes help to raise siblings from subsequent clutches. Helpers contribute to feeding of nestlings but not to incubation or nest-building. Help provided by related individuals results in increased juvenile recruitment at helped nests. Unrelated helpers may also assist with breeding and are thought to gain pairing opportunities from helping.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Riflemen are relatively poor flyers with limited dispersal capability. They typically move through the forest using short flights, mainly from canopy to canopy. The majority of time is spent foraging for small insects in the canopy or on tree trunks; in the absence of introduced predators, riflemen also forage on the ground. They use a variety of foraging behaviours including probing beneath bark on the trunks of trees, gleaning from leaves and branches, and are infrequently seen to aerial forage. Riflemen are a monogamous species with long-term pair-bonds, only replacing a mate if one of the pair dies. Mates forage in close proximity throughout the year, keeping in contact using frequent calls. Breeding appears to be initiated by male nest-building behaviour. Males contribute substantially to the parental effort including nuptial feeding, nest building, and a share of incubation, and nestling and fledgling care. Riflemen live in kin neighbourhoods and are often seen in cooperative groups which raise broods together. Loose territories are occupied but are rarely aggressively defended. Territory boundaries appear to be loosely defined with no vocal or behavioural advertisement of boundaries, and neighbour intrusions largely tolerated.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Riflemen are exclusively insectivorous, feeding on a large variety of small invertebrates, particularly beetles, spiders and moth species (both adults and caterpillars).</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman_(bird)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman_(bird)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/small-forest-birds/page-2\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/small-forest-birds/page-2</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/titipounamu.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/titipounamu.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Cooper, A. 1994.

All three subspecies are thought to have become extinct within 20 years of each other due to predation by rats and (probably) stoats.</p>\n<p>The bush wren was one of seven recent species in the New Zealand wren family, which was the first (or most ancient) branch within the enormously diverse order of songbirds. Two members only of the family survive &#x2013; rifleman and rock wren. The latter is the closest relative of the bush wren, and the two species were very similar in appearance and behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The bush wren was a very small, short-tailed perching bird that rarely flew. The head and back were olive-green or brown, darker on the head, often with a distinct brown cap contrasting with the greener back. A white eyebrow stripe was usually prominent, though reduced or absent in some Stewart Island birds. The underparts were slate grey, contrasting with the pale chin and dull yellow on the flanks. The female was browner than the male. Stewart Island birds were more variable in plumage, ranging from green to brown on the back. North Island birds were reported to have slate blue on sides of neck and chest, and brighter yellow flanks. All forms had long&#xA0;legs and toes.&#xA0; As for the similar rock wren, bush wrens often bobbed when otherwise stationary.</p>\n<p>Voice: a subdued trill, faint rasp or loud &#x2018;seep&#x2019;, sometimes rapidly repeated. A loud cheep when alarmed. Pairs maintained contact with continuous soft calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: bush wrens were larger and darker than rifleman, with much longer legs (rifleman also has a diagnostic upturned bill). The very similar rock wren differs in being paler underneath, without contrast between chin and breast. The cap of the rock wren usually contrasts less with the browner back plumage. Rock wren also has pale tips to the secondary feathers, forming a row of pale spots on lower back when perched (lacking in bush wren).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Bush wrens were formerly found in forest and scrub in mountainous areas in the North and South Islands, plus Kapiti Island, Stewart Island and the three nearby South Cape islands (Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island, Rerewhakaupoko/Solomon Island and Pukeweka). They were probably throughout in suitable habitat, but there were few recorded locations in the North Island in historic times (the few records included Urewera, Lake Taupo, Rimutaka Range, and Days Bay). Bush wrens were predominantly recorded from beech forest and subalpine shrubland in the South Island, podocarp forest in Fiordland and on Stewart Island, and muttonbird scrub (low tree daisy forest) on islands off Stewart Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Bush wrens are almost certainly extinct. The last recorded sightings were from the North Island in 1955 (Lake Waikaremoana), the South Island in 1968 (Moss Pass, Nelson Lakes; also Arthur&#x2019;s Pass in 1966 and Milford Sound in 1965), Stewart Island in 1951 (near Halfmoon Bay), and Taukihepa in 1964.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Bush wrens were rapidly extirpated by ship rats on Taukihepa, Rerewhakaupoko and Pukeweka Islands in 1964. Rodents (Pacific rat first, then Norway rat, and finally ship rat) were probably the main cause of decline of bush wren in the North and South Islands and Stewart Island, with stoats likely to have contributed to declines and eventual extinction in the North and South Islands after their deliberate introductions in the 1880s.</p>\n<p>Six bush wrens were translocated from Taukihepa to nearby Kaimohu Island by the Wildlife Service in 1964, in a desperate rescue attempt following the invasion and irruption of ship rats on the South Cape islands. Two birds were seen on Kaimohu Island in 1972 &#x2013; the last accepted sighting of bush wren.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Bush wrens constructed spherical nests with the entrance at the side near the top. Nests were strongly constructed with fern rootlets, moss and leaves and lined with feathers of other birds. Nests were well concealed in holes in trees or logs, among tree roots, fern clumps or in banks, often close to the ground. Nests were often in damp sites, and birds would replace the feather lining after rain. Two (sometimes 3) eggs were laid in November or December, incubation and chick care were shared. Eggs were ovoid, white, 18 x 13.2 mm (<em>X. l. longipes</em>, South Island), 21 x 15.5 mm (<em>X. l. variabilis</em>, Rerewhakaupoko).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Bush wrens were encountered as pairs or small family groups, and were territorial when breeding. On the mainland they were reported to feed among branches, cf. rifleman feeding on trunks. On islands off Stewart Island, bush wrens kept among low dense vegetation, and spent much time on the ground, including entering petrel burrows. Their movements were restless, swift and furtive. Flights were short and direct. Bush wrens often bobbed on landing, either the whole body or just the head.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Bush wrens ate small moths, flies, beetles, insect larvae and spiders, collected by gleaning and probing crevices.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushwren\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushwren</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/matuhi.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/matuhi.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cresswell, R.A. 1968.

It remains above the bush line throughout its life and is the only truly alpine bird in New Zealand. The New Zealand wrens (Family Acanthisittidae) are an ancient and endemic lineage that up until 1000 years ago included 7 species in 5 genera. Only the rock wren and the rifleman survive. The rock wren has a disjunct distribution because of its preferred habitat of alpine basins and its habit of hole-nesting on the ground leads to predation by mice and stoats. These characteristics make the species vulnerable to local extinctions.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The rock wren is a small, alpine bird with short tail, rounded wings and long legs and toes. The male is dull&#xA0;green above and grey-brown below with yellow flanks. Pale tips to the secondary feathers usually form a row&#xA0;of pale spots on the lower back when perched. The female is slightly plainer, mainly olive-brown. Rock wrens&#xA0;bob vigorously along with wing flicks, and usually hop and run rather than flying.</p>\n<p>Voice: a high pitched three note call and a &#x2018;whirring&#x2019; call.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the rifleman is similar but the habitat of each is unlikely to overlap. The rock wren is larger&#xA0;and has a shorter and straighter bill. The bush wren (considered extinct since 1972) was very similar to rock&#xA0;wren but was darker underneath (contrasting with a paler chin), and lacked pale tips to the secondaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Rock wrens are widely but patchily distributed through alpine and sub-alpine areas of the South Island. They&#xA0;are most common within the Southern Alps from Fiordland, through South Westland, and Mt Aspiring and Mt&#xA0;Cook National Parks. Localised populations exist further north in Arthur&apos;s Pass, Nelson Lakes and Kahurangi&#xA0;National Parks. Rock wrens are less abundant and even more localised in the Eyre Mountains, and parts of&#xA0;inland Canterbury and the Victoria Range. Many of these locations are seemingly disjunct from other rock&#xA0;wren populations. They are found from 900 m to 2500 m in altitude where the habitat may vary from dense&#xA0;sub-alpine scrub, through talus where stable rock falls are interspersed with low shrubbery to bare rock in&#xA0;very exposed situations. Rock wrens are no longer present in the Kaikoura Mountains and have never been&#xA0;confirmed from Stewart Island, the Takitimu Mountains and the Paparoa Range.</p>\n<p>Rock wren were transferred successfully to Secretary Island in Fiordland in 2008-10.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Not known.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Stoats and mice are known to prey on the contents of rock wren nests. There is little information on how&#xA0;frequently this occurs and whether the intensity of predation varies between years dependent on changes in&#xA0;tussock seeding, which affects mouse (and therefore stoat) population densities. During the 2012-13 summer a study in the upper Hollyford showed that most nests were preyed on by stoats. Changes in distribution and&#xA0;the frequency of sightings suggest that rock wren are declining. At present all rock wren habitat is above the&#xA0;altitudinal limit for ship rats but this may change with global warming, and cause an increase in predation. The conservation of this species was changed from nationally vulnerable to nationally endangered in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Rock wrens breed in spring and summer. A thickly lined and fully enclosed nest is constructed at ground&#xA0;level within a natural cavity. The average clutch size is 3, with only one brood reared in a season. Both adults&#xA0;incubate the eggs and care for the young.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Rock wren typically spend most time hopping and flitting through the alpine boulder fields they inhabit, calling&#xA0;intermittently to others. Foraging birds will occasionally disappear amongst large rocks or into the surrounding dense alpine shrubbery. When stationary the bird bobs up and down, often with flicking wings. Flights are&#xA0;short and close to the ground. This behaviour suggests a sedentary species with poor dispersal ability and&#xA0;yet there have been occasional records in previously uninhabited alpine areas and in valley floors. Birds are known to over-winter in the alpine zone. One banded bird survived for 5 years.&#xA0;Rock wrens often have an anklet of dead skin around one or both legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Rock wren mainly eat insects (especially moths, moth larvae, flies, beetles, scale insects) and spiders. Fruit&#xA0;from <em>Gaultheria</em> and <em>Coprosma</em> spp. are also eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Rockwren\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Rockwren</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://faunarecovery.org.nz/rock-wren\">http://faunarecovery.org.nz/rock-wren</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22698585/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22698585/0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3992\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3992</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/rockwren.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/rockwren.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Michelsen-Heath, S. 1989, The breeding biology of the rock wren<em>, Xenicus gilviventris</em>, in the Murchison Mountains, Fiordland National Park, New Zealand. <em>Unpubl.

It was common around the Chatham Island coast, and its remains are also known from a few sites on Pitt Island. It had relatively long, slender legs, and retained strong powers of flight. It probably attended seal, sea lion and seabird colonies, where they would have had access to unprotected pups, spilt regurgitations, eggs, chicks and carrion.

The presence of raven bone remains in midden sites shows that they were eaten by humans. However, it is equally likely that extinction of the Chatham Island raven was part of a trophic cascade of effects caused by humans on the Chatham Islands, as the once enormous colonies of seals and seabirds they relied on were destroyed by over-hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Raven\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Raven</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gill, B.; Martinson, P. 1991. <em>New Zealand&apos;s extinct birds</em>.

Liberations in the Nelson and Auckland areas and failed, but after a slow start, populations in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and Canterbury flourished and spread. The rook&#x2019;s diet is a mixture of invertebrates and vegetable and the rook is often vilified by farmers for its crop destruction. Others have accepted this intelligent bird as a welcome addition to our sparse large bird fauna.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Rooks are almost entirely black with a purplish gloss. The face is bare light grey skin, the beak is long, pointed and black, and the eye is dark brown. When walking on the ground they have the appearance of baggy-trouser like feathers on the upper leg. Juvenile rooks have feathered faces. With steady wing beat in the air, the rook creates a short-necked silhouette, like a black cloth being towed through the sky.</p>\n<p>Voice: usually a repeated <em>caw,</em> <em>kaah, kroh, gag, </em>and sometimes <em>kiu.</em></p>\n<p>Similar species: there are no other crow species confirmed to occur in New Zealand, although a possible Australian raven was reported from Mokohinau and Little Barrier Islands in October 1945, and other Australian crow species could occur as vagrants. The Australian raven is larger than a rook, has a feathered face and long pointed &#x2018;hackle&#x2019; feathers under the chin. All five Australian crow species are larger than the rook, have feathered faces, white eyes, and lack the &#x2018;baggy-trouser&#x2019; look, and are mainly distinguished from each other by their calls. Single, silent, vagrant birds would be very difficult to identify to species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Poisoning of nests by regional councils has eliminated the large rookeries that were common in the arable farmland and in hill country of Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and Canterbury. The populations now consist of scattered individuals across a wide geographical range. In the North Island they are known to exist or have existed in Miranda (Firth of Thames), Tolaga (north of Gisborne), Waitotara (Taranaki), southern Waikato, Manawatu (from Palmerston North to Cheltenham), and Taihape as well as their strong hold of Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and northern Wairarapa. Rooks in Canterbury have spread less but have been found in Middlemarch (North Otago). It has been claimed that rooks are now extinct in Canterbury. Juveniles have been seen in Northland, Wellington, Southland, and on Chatham and Stewart Islands.</p>\n<p>Rooks are found throughout Europe and Asia.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>It was estimated that there were about 30,000 rooks (25,000 in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and about 2,500 in Canterbury) before control was started in the 1970s. The number of rooks killed in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay between 1971 and 1985 totalled about 50,000 birds. The population now-a-days is not known due the nomadic nature of the remaining rooks, but the Hawke&#x2019;s Bay Regional destroyed 700 nests between Wairoa and southern Hawke&#x2019;s Bay in 2012. It is thought that many of the remaining rooks are males because the poisoning of nests targets the females, which do all the incubation of eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Rooks are listed as an Unwanted Organism in New Zealand, and are the focus of eradication campaigns by several regional councils. Before their numbers were reduced, they were a serious problem to germinating arable crops such as maize, sweet corn, cereals, pumpkins, peas (both at planting and maturing), and apples.&#xA0;Rooks can also damage pasture by opening it up to thistles and other weeds while looking for grass grub. On the positive side they do remove a number of pest insects and break up stock dung looking for fly larvae.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Rooks nest in colonies &#x2013; the origin of the term &#x2018;rookery&#x2019;. The largest colony in New Zealand was nearly 1,000 nests but these massive groupings are a thing of the past. Colonies are usually in eucalyptus, pine or macrocarpa trees, and they have been recorded from Norfolk pines and acacia trees. The nests are built with twigs into a rough cup and lined with pine needles, eucalyptus bark, and tufts of grass, along with roots and sometime with pieces of wool. Egg-laying is from late August to late October. Clutches typically consist of 1-4 and sometimes as many as seven eggs. The eggs are pale greenish blue with brown splotches (39 x 28 mm, 16 g). Females alone incubate the eggs (15-19 days) and broods the nestlings. The male feeds the female and nestlings, which fledge at between 26 and 38 days. Generally rooks start to breed at between 2-3 years of age. The longest living banded rook in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay was about 15 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Rooks used to feed in gregarious flocks. They would roost in large winter roosts containing birds from a number of breeding colonies. They would visit the breeding rookery first thing in the morning and again in the evening before returning to the roost site. Nowadays they are seen roosting only in small numbers. They usually travel up to 10 km from their night-time roost to feeding sites, while in the breeding season they forage within a few kilometres of the rookery. They are an extremely wary bird now and little is known of their habits.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The main foods of rooks are invertebrates, especially fly larvae and adult beetles and larvae (grass grub) during warmer months. Walnuts and acorns are taken in autumn and winter. When these foods are scarce, cereals are taken mainly from stubble. Other important foods are carrion, earthworms, peas, grass and clover. Foods fed to young rooks are similar to those eaten by adults except that the young are fed more striped dung fly larvae and a few blowfly larvae.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rook_(bird)\"><cite>Wikipedia</cite></a></p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob15630.htm\">http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob15630.htm</a></cite></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Buddle, G.A. 1947.

They are restless birds, and often hunt insects from a perch high in the canopy and sub-canopy of trees, flying out and catching insects in mid-air or picking them from branches or foliage. On alighting the tail is sometimes wagged from side to side but more usually quivered. The two sexes look quite different. Males are glossy blue-black on the upper surfaces, head and upper breast. The lower breast and belly are clean white, with a sharply demarcation line across the upper breast. Females are grey with a blue gloss on the upper parts, the chin, throat and upper breast are rusty reddish, sharply demarcated from the white lower breast and belly.

Although superficially similar to the much larger Australian magpie, the magpie-lark belongs to the monarch-flycatcher family, the other members of which are arboreal and much smaller. There is a single record from New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The magpie-lark is a slender, black-and-white ground-dwelling songbird. It is about the size of a blackbird, but with longer legs and a more elongate body. The overall plumage pattern is black above and white below, with bold facial markings, and a prominent white panel in the middle of the folded wing. The tail appears black with a very narrow white tip, as the white base is concealed by the folded wings. Males have a bold white eye-brow and a large black bib extending from the chin to the upper breast. A large white patch on the lower cheek separates the bib from a black line through the eye. Females have a white forehead and chin surrounded by a black band extending from the crown, through the eye and down to the throat. Both sexes have a slender pale yellowish bill, white eyes, and dark legs and feet. Juveniles are browner, and have a white chin (like adult females) but a black forehead, and a white eyebrow (like adult males); juveniles also have a dark bill and black eyes. In flight the outer wing is black and the inner wing white (both above and below), the back is black, and the tail is mainly white with a bold black wedge extending from the tip towards the body (both above and below). The flight is strong and direct.</p>\n<p>Voice: ringing, metallic piping call.

Although superficially similar to an Australian magpie, the magpie-lark is much smaller, and differs in having white underparts (magpies are dark underneath).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The magpie-lark is endemic to mainland Australia and Timor, with scattered records elsewhere in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, plus Tasmania. It is common on Lord Howe Island (introduced in 1924, but also vagrant before then). In mainland Australia, it is widespread and common in open country, especially near water. It is often seen in urban parks and along roadsides. Some populations move north in winter, when they may congregate in flocks of more than a hundred (mainly immature) birds. </p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>An adult male photographed at the mouth of Gorge River (75 km southwest of Haast) on 29 April 2008 is the sole accepted New Zealand vagrant record.&#xA0;Magpie-larks were introduced to multiple locations in the North Island during 1898-1900, but failed to establish.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Magpie-larks breed mainly as monogamous pairs with year-round pair bonds; most breeding is in spring and summer. A characteristic mud-cup nest (also containing straw and rootlets) about 15 cm in diameter is attached to a horizontal branch or occasionally manmade surface (e.g. the cross-beam of a power-pole). Both parents incubate the 3-4 pinkish eggs (28 x 21 mm), which takes about 18 days, followed by about 3 weeks of caring for the nestlings. Fledglings are fed for a further 3-4 weeks after leaving the nest. Multiple broods may be raised.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Magpie-larks are most often seen foraging on the ground as singles or pairs, walking with their heads moving back and forth with each stride. They form strong pair-bonds, reinforced by antiphonal singing (duetting) used to defend their territory. The song is accompanied by characteristic raising and lowering of the wings.</p>\n<p>Magpie-larks are aggressive in defending their nest sites, driving off larger birds, and diving at human intruders.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Magpie-larks are mainly insectivorous, finding prey by walking across short turf and bare ground. Seeds, small vertebrates and human food scraps are also taken.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie-lark\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie-lark</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2015/07/01/a-new-bird-for-new-zealand-magpie-lark/\">A new bird for New Zealand &#x2013; magpie lark</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gill, B.J.; Bell, B.D.; Chambers, G.K.; Medway, D.G.; Palma, R.L.; Scofield, R.P.

It is rarely seen in highly modified open habitats, such as farmland and suburbia. Tomtits have a widespread distribution through the North and South Islands, and occur on some of their offshore islands, Stewart Island, Chatham Islands, Snares Islands and Auckland Islands. Most populations are dimorphic, males being mainly black-and-white, and females mainly brown-and-white. They are often heard giving contact calls or males singing, but are sometimes difficult to see. Individuals can be quite confiding, coming within a few metres.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Adults of both sexes of Snares Island tomtit are black, juveniles being a duller black-brown. In the four other subspecies, adult males have a black head, upper chest and back, black wings with one white bar on each wing across the bases of the flight feathers, a black tail with some white on some outer feathers, and white underparts. In the South, Chatham and Auckland Islands subspecies, males have some yellow and/or orange colouration on the lower chest and belly, being brightest at the sharp demarcation with the black on the upper chest. They have a white spot at the base of the upper mandible which can be enlarged during displays. Juvenile males have duller plumage, and have subtle streaking on head as a result of white shafts of black feathers. Adult female of Auckland Island tomtit is similar in colouration to male but with black areas being duller. Adult females of North, South and Chatham subspecies are brown over the head, back and wings (white/buff wingbar present), and fawn on the upper chest which fades to white on the belly. Juvenile females are similar, but with faint streaking on the head.</p>\n<p>Voice: both sexes make short &#x201C;<em>seet</em>&#x201D;, &#x201C;<em>zet</em>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<em>swee</em>&#x201D; contact calls throughout the year, most often given singularly, but up to five in quick succession. Full song is given by adult males throughout the year, except during the moult period (February-April). The song has been rendered as &#x201C;<em>ti-oly-oly-oly-ho</em>&#x201D;, and lasts 2-3 seconds. Also, give a downscale call, a series of &#x2018;chuck&#x2019; calls, descending in tone, and which start in rapid succession and finish slowly. Downscales are sometimes given after a neighbour has given such a call, and also in response to such calls by robins.</p>\n<p>Similar species: there is no similar species to the tomtit in the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island forest and shrubland habitats; robins are larger, longer legged and lack white wingbars.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Tomtits are found from Northland to Stewart Island, particularly in forests of the central North Island and along the west coast of the South Island from Northwest Nelson to Fiordland. Also, occurs on several forested offshore islands, such as Little Barrier and Kapiti. Found on some islands of the Chathams group (Pitt, Mangere, Little Mangere and Rangatira), on the Snares Islands, and on Auckland Islands (Auckland, Adams, Ocean, Rose, Ewing and Enderby).</p>\n<p>This adaptable species uses a variety of habitats from sea level to the subalpine zone. Tomtits can be found in all mature native forest types, including podocarp-broadleaf, beech, and manuka-kanuka forests, as well as regenerating forests after being logged. Exotic plantations are also occupied, particularly mature stands. Tomtits have been recorded occasionally on well-treed farmland, and in suburban parks and gardens. On Snares Islands and Auckland Islands, tomtits occupy forest, shrubland and also tussock grasslands with scattered shrubs.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Tomtits are widespread and fairly common through the North and South Islands. The population was estimated to number about 1000 birds on the Snares Islands in 1987, less than 1000 birds on the Chatham Islands in 2001, and no estimate has been made of numbers on the Auckland Islands. Although populations declined during European settlement (forest clearance), comparison of distribution of the species in the North and South Islands during 1969-79 and 1999-2004 suggest there was little or no change during the 20-year interval.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Presently, the main threat to populations on North and South Islands is from introduced mammalian predators, particularly ship rats. While many clutches and broods are taken by predators, adult females also suffer mortality because they alone incubate clutches and brood young, and their habit of nesting in shallow cavities means that they are not always able to escape once a predator arrives at the nest. To date this species has proven difficult to establish populations through translocation. Seven attempts have been made, some involving more than one transfer, with only two translocations (Mangere Island in the Chatham Islands, and Cape Kidnappers) resulting in new populations.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>On the North and South Islands, the breeding season extends mainly from September to February. During this period pairs are able to rear three broods, although very few achieve this because clutches and broods are taken by predators. The breeding season is shorter on the Chatham, Snares and Auckland Islands, such that pairs rear only 1-2 broods. Nests are well concealed in thick vegetation or shallow cavities, and most clutches consist of 3-4 eggs. While the female alone incubates the eggs, the male assists by providing food to his mate 2-3 times an hour. Both members of the pair feed nestlings and fledglings.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Tomtits remain on their territories throughout the year. During the moult, territorial activities, such as singing, boundary patrolling and chasing out intruders, are much reduced, but during the rest of the year, especially during the breeding season, both males and females are vigorous in territorial defence. While territorial adults are sedentary, juveniles and immatures looking for mates and vacant habitat sometimes disperse tens of kilometres, including crossing unsuitable habitat (e.g. open-country farmland) and over water. As a result individuals are sometimes seen during autumn-winter in some towns.</p>\n<p>Tomtits search for prey at all levels in forest, from in emergents above the canopy to the ground. Their principle method of foraging involves scanning the surrounding area while perched on a branch or clinging to a trunk, and then flying forth to snatch up a prey item or moving to another perch to scan a new area. Areas scanned for prey include all vegetation surfaces and the ground. They generally forage alone or in pairs, but occasionally associate with mixed-species foraging flocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Tomtits feed on a wide range of small invertebrates, including spiders, amphipods, beetles, flies, moths (both adults and larvae) and weta. Also, small fruit are occasionally eaten, being swallowed whole.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomtit\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomtit</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/tomtit-miromiro/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/tomtit-miromiro/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/miromiro2.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/miromiro2.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Male are great songsters, particularly bachelors, singing loudly and often for many minutes at a time.

Males at independence are a light grey or dark grey colouration, like females. Most males achieve adult colouration (generally dark grey-black) at their second moult when 19-22 months old, but a small proportion take another year before becoming blackish, and a few seem to remain dark grey throughout their lives. Males breed successfully whether they are light grey (&lt; 12 months old), dark grey or blackish. Many contour feathers of North Island robins have pale shafts and this gives the species its faintly streaked appearance. Both sexes have a pale grey-white patch over the lower chest-belly, and are able to expose a small white spot of feathers above the base of the beak during intraspecific and interspecific interactions.</p>\n<p>Voice: North Island robins have four recognisable vocalisations. Fullsong is a series of phrases given loudly by males only, generally from a high perch. Robins can be heard giving fullsong year round, but particularly during the breeding season. It is used to indicate territorial occupancy and to attract a mate &#x2013; bachelors spend much more time singing than paired males. Subsong is similar to fullsong but given at much less volume, is given by both sexes, and most frequently during the moult. The downscale is a series of very loud &#x2018;chuck&#x2019; calls, descending in frequency, and which start in rapid succession and finish slowly. The call lasts 3-4 seconds, is given by both sexes, and is most frequently heard in the non-breeding season (Jan-Aug). The fourth vocalisation type is the &#x2018;chuck&#x2019;, which is given as single notes (contact calls) or in rapid succession and loudly (alarm call) when a predator is present.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Similar species: there is no similar species to the robin in North Island forest. It is much larger and lacks the white wing-bars of the tomtit.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>This robin is restricted to the central North Island from Taranaki to the Bay of Plenty, plus Little Barrier and Kapiti Islands. Several populations beyond these areas have been established by translocations. Robin distribution can be quite patchy even within extensive blocks of mature native forest. A comparison of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand&#x2019;s atlas scheme results of 1969-79 and 1999-2004 indicate that the North Island robin&#x2019;s distribution in the central North Island has changed little&#xA0;during the 20 year interval. However, as a result of translocations its distribution has been enhanced with the establishment of populations on some pest-free islands and in pest-controlled mainland sites.</p>\n<p>Robins occur in mature forest, tall scrub, and exotic plantations, particularly those that are fairly mature and have patches of shrubs as an understorey. They seem to favour moist areas where there is an open understorey under a closed canopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Formerly widespread over the North Island, robins are now restricted mainly to extensive forest blocks in the centre of the island. It is patchily distributed through this area, being absent from seemingly suitable areas and common in others. Pairs have territories of 1-5 ha, although populations on pest-free islands can occur at much greater densities (0.2-0.6 ha / pair).&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Forest clearance for farmland during the 19th and 20th centuries resulted in loss of habitat of the North Island robin. Today the main threat to its conservation is predation by introduced mammalian predators, such as feral cats, stoats, possums, and particularly the ubiquitous and arboreal ship rat. Eggs, nestlings and adult females (which carry out incubation and brooding of young at night) are frequently preyed upon where predators are not controlled. As a result populations become male biased. Where pest control is carried out, populations increase rapidly, and the sex ratio returns to almost 1:1 within a few years &#x2013; there are usually a few more males than females. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>North Island robins start nesting in September. The female builds the nest, the male bringing her food 2-3 times per hour. Many nests are sited against tree trunks; in trunk forks, at trunk-branch junctions, on epiphytes next to trunks. Only females incubate, their clutches usually consisting of 2-3 eggs. Her mate calls her from the nest every 20 minutes or so to provide her with food. Once nestlings are more than 5 days old, males take all food to their broods rather than to their mates. Nestlings leave the nest when about 3 weeks old, and continue to be fed by their parents for a further 5-6 weeks. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Male robins are territorial year round, although their aggression towards intruders is subdued during the moult. Pairs remain in their territories most of the time, occasionally sneaking into neighbouring territories to feed or go elsewhere to drink and bathe. Males dominate their mates during the non-breeding season, such that pair members are usually found apart. Some females change mates, which has occurred during the breeding season and non-breeding season. Females have left their mates after successfully fledging a brood (male rears the fledglings) and after predation of eggs or nestlings. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Robins use a variety of activities to flush hidden or camouflaged prey, such as foot trembling, wing-flicking and tail-flicking. Occasionally they capture relatively large prey. These are killed, dismembered, and some portions are often cached. These are usually retrieved later the same day or the following one.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>While robins spend much time foraging on the ground, in tall forests they also forage over trunks and branches, especially those that are covered in epiphytes, such as mosses. Much of their diet consists of invertebrates, and they also eat small ripe fruit in summer and autumn, particularly during drought when few soil-dwelling invertebrates are available.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_Robin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_Robin</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/north-island-robin-toutouwai/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/north-island-robin-toutouwai/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Alexander, L; Duthie, C.; Fyfe, J.; Haws, Z.; Hunt, S.; Montoya, I.; Ochoa, C.; Siva, A.; Stringer, L.; Van Horik, J; Burns, K.C. 2005.

It occurs in forest and scrub habitats, where it spends much time foraging on the ground, and can be recognised by its erect stance and relatively long legs. It is a territorial species, males in particular inhabiting the same patch of forest throughout their lives. Males are great songsters, particularly bachelors, singing loudly and often for many minutes at a time. Where robins are regularly exposed to people, such as along public walking tracks, they become quite confiding, often approaching to within a metre of a person sitting quietly. Juveniles will sometimes stand on a person&#x2019;s boot.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p>The adult male South Island robin is dark grey-black over the head, neck, mantle and upper chest; the flight feathers and tail are brownish-black, and the lower chest and belly white to yellowish white with a sharp demarcation between black and white on chest. Adult females are light to dark grey over the upper body. They further differ from males in the &#xA0;white chest-belly area being smaller and not having such a distinct demarcation between grey and white feathering. Juveniles are similar to females, but often with a smaller or no white patch on the underparts.

Robins are much larger and lack the white wing-bars of tomtits.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>The South Island robin has a disjunct distribution through both the South and Stewart Islands. Its strongholds in the South Island are Marlborough, Nelson, West Coast as far south as about Harihari, and through Fiordland, with outliers at Jackson Bay and Dunedin. A comparison of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand&#x2019;s atlas scheme results of 1969-79 and 1999-2004 suggest that the South Island robin&#x2019;s distribution has changed little during the 20 year interval. Several populations, particularly on islands, have been established by translocations.</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Robins occur in mature forest, scrub, and exotic plantations, particularly those that are fairly mature with an open understorey. They seem to favour moist areas where there is an open understorey under a closed canopy on fertile soils. Habitats that tend to be shunned are those with widely scattered trees and where the ground is covered by grasses or sparse vegetation on stony, droughty soils. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>South Island robin is patchily distributed through its range, and is absent from some seemingly suitable areas while common in others.

The female builds the nest while her mate brings her food 2-3 times per hour. Only females incubate the 2-4 eggs; her mate calls her from the nest every 20 minutes or so to provide her with food. Both parents feed the nestlings. Nestlings leave the nest when about 3 weeks old, and continue to be fed by their parents for a further 5-6 weeks. If one fledgling is reared the male feeds it while the female builds a nest and incubates the next clutch. If there are two fledglings, each is usually fed by a different parent, and if three the male usually looks after two and the female one. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Male robins are territorial year round, although their aggression towards intruders is subdued during the moult.

Much of their diet consists of invertebrates, and large prey items include earthworms, cicadas, stick insects, tree weta and slugs.

Robins also eat small ripe fruit in summer and autumn, particularly during drought when few soil-dwelling invertebrates are available.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Robin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Robin</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Flack, J.A.D. 1979.

It is a quiet, confiding forest-dweller, alert and almost always active in the lower forest strata. Birds are commonly attracted to human presence. The species is famous world-wide for its inspiring recovery from imminent extinction in the early 1980s.</p>\n<p>Black robins are closely related to New Zealand&#x2019;s other <em>Petroica </em>species (tomtit, and North Island and South Island robins). All are descended from Australian <em>Petroica</em> ancestors.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The black robin is a small, rotund bird intermediate in size and form between its tomtit and robin relatives. Both sexes are completely black at all ages, though juveniles have subtle pale streaking on the crown. Its tail, legs and bill are slightly longer and stouter than those of the Chatham Island tomtit&#xA0;with which&#xA0;it shares its range<em>.</em> Birds appear short and round through their habit of holding their large heads hunched close to their bodies. The sexes are indistinguishable to casual observation (weight and size ranges overlap).</p>\n<p>Voice: a limited range of calls. Song, generally of 4-5 clear notes, is given mainly by males. It is not as rich or melodic as the calls of mainland robins. Males and females give a simple down-scale call, perhaps territorially. A single high-pitched note may be given in alarm or aggression. Contact calls when feeding resemble tomtit trills but are quieter.</p>\n<p>Similar species: this is the only robin and only completely black <em>Petroica </em>species on the Chatham Islands. It shares its breeding and foraging ranges with the smaller Chatham Island tomtit.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black robins originally inhabited the five major forested islands in the archipelago: Chatham (90,040 ha), Pitt (6325 ha), Rangatira (South East) Island (218 ha), Mangere (113 ha), and Little Mangere (9 ha). Human activities eliminated all original populations, the last in 1976 when the survivors were moved from Little Mangere to Mangere Island for conservation purposes. Descendants of these&#xA0;seven survivors have been returned to Rangatira Island, which, like Mangere Island, is a protected sanctuary. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The black robin breeds, forages and socialises almost exclusively within forest interiors. This habit is unique among Australasia&#x2019;s temperate-zone <em>Petroica</em>. Birds are reluctant to venture outside forest perimeters and do not breed well in scattered or fragmented vegetation. The species favours large continuous tracts of forest with a closed canopy, mixed under-storey species and edges enclosed by dense sheltering vegetation. Optimum forest type comprises trees of complex structure, mixed height and age classes which offer abundant nesting and foraging opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Populations</strong></p>\n<p>During&#xA0;pre-breeding censuses in October 2011, 281 birds were counted. The Mangere Island population comprised 47 birds. At least 234 adults were alive on Rangatira Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The black robin is more extinction-prone than its <em>Petroica</em> relatives. Very low reproductive output, specialised forest-dwelling and foraging habits, narrow tolerances to habitat type and quality, and very limited powers of dispersal are key vulnerabilities. These traits exaggerate the effects of extinction pressures and suppress rebounds from population knock-downs.</p>\n<p>Chronic inbreeding over more than a century and severe loss of genetic diversity further jeopardise resilience. Degrees of relatedness in today&#x2019;s populations are among the highest recorded for any avian species in the wild. Inbreeding depression is expressed through lowered reproductive output. Long-term persistence of populations is uncertain.</p>\n<p>Black robins are extremely vulnerable to external threats. Original populations were eliminated swiftly by introduced cats and Pacific rats. Mice and starlings may also threaten population viability. Historically, one large population was eliminated by declines in forest&#xA0;area and quality alone.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Today&#x2019;s populations are unnaturally small. Long periods of farming on both islands have reduced the extent of suitable forest cover available (about 8 ha on Mangere Island and 110 ha on Rangatira Island).</p>\n<p>Conservation relies on quarantine of today&#x2019;s small populations from predators, new pathogens and habitat loss. Genetic health is managed though increasing population sizes. Extinction risk will be reduced by translocating birds to new habitats within the Chathams.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Black robins breed annually in spring and summer. Cup-like nests are built in tree cavities or dense <em>Muehlenbeckia</em> vines, usually within 2 metres of the ground. Most clutches comprise two eggs (range 1-3). Only the female incubates but both parents care for the young. Pairs are capable of raising two clutches to independence per season (one is usual).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The breeding, foraging and social behaviour of the black robin resembles that of its <em>Petroica</em> relatives. Water and open spaces are barriers to movement, so that colonising of detached habitat is slow, and natural migration between islands does not occur. They have a patriarchal social system based on territories, which are defended most aggressively during breeding. Birds are monogamous and may mate for life. Site and pair fidelity is strong between years. Juveniles are usually evicted from territories in their natal season.</p>\n<p>Black robins are always alert and active, moving about in brief direct flights. Birds forage diurnally in sub-storey vegetation and on the ground (usually pouncing from low branches, or flicking ground litter over with their bills). Large prey items (such as wetas &lt; 20 mm) are thrashed against objects first to remove limbs. Unlike mainland robins, black robins do not cache food.</p>\n<p>Black robins make a long parental investment in a few offspring, typical of the slow breeding strategies of temperate southern hemisphere birds. Reproductive output is the lowest recorded among known Australasian <em>Petroica </em>because clutch sizes are unusually small, the breeding cycle is long and the breeding season is shortened climatically.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Males live 4.2 years on average, slightly longer than females (3.7) but a very small number of both sexes may reach ages up to 14 years. Both can breed successfully as yearlings and in old age (&#x2264; 11 years).</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black robins are wholly insectivorous. Prey items include many winged and wingless invertebrate taxa at all life-stages, including spiders, flies, wetas, worms, beetles, moths, cockroaches and caterpillars. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/black-robin/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/black-robin/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/offshore-islands/mangere-and-rangatira-islands/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/land-and-freshwater/offshore-islands/mangere-and-rangatira-islands/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Ardern, S.L.; Lambert, D.M. 1997.

Their small size and streaked brown plumage make them difficult to see on the ground, but their vibrant aerial song quickly reveals their presence, a song that has inspired poets and musicians for centuries. Skylarks were introduced into New Zealand from England between 1864 and 1879, when more than 1000 birds were released. Birds from New Zealand were released in turn on the Hawaiian Islands in 1870, supplementing a population introduced there from England five years earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The skylark is a small brown-streaked bird with off-white underparts, streaked breast and throat, and variegated brown upperparts in which the pale edges to the back, scapular, upper wing coverts, and flight feathers contrast with their darker centres. Juvenile birds have more pronounced pale edges to these feathers. Adults have a faint mask of pale feathers around and behind the eye, and a small streaked crest in the hind crown, raised when the birds are alert. The outer tail feathers are predominantly white, contrasting strongly with the rest of the tail, which is brown. The wings are broad, the brown flight feathers showing a narrow white trailing edge best seen from below when the bird is in flight. The bill is sturdy, horn-coloured at the tip, and yellow-brown at the base; the legs and feet are pink, with a long slightly curved hind toe.</p>\n<p>Voice: a rich and prolonged sequence of chirps, trills and whistles, rising and falling rhythmically, given during an aerial display, 30-100 m overhead. Males sing a shorter version from elevated perches such as fence posts or bushes. Call is a liquid <em>chirrup</em>, given in level flight.</p>\n<p>Similar species: New Zealand pipit, is similarly coloured and also occurs in open-country habitats, more usually on stonier and rougher ground. In general, pipits are more strongly streaked, with greater contrast between the dark centres and pale edges of the back and wing feathers. Pipits also have more prominent eye stripes; no crest; thinner, darker bills; often a more upright stance; and the habit of rhythmically wagging their tails up and down. Pipits typically walk or run in front of an observer, whereas skylarks crouch then fly. Note that pipit, yellowhammer, cirl bunting and chaffinch all have white outer tail feathers prominent in flight.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Skylarks are widespread in farmland, dune fields, tussock grasslands and other open habitats. During the 1999-2004 Bird Atlas survey, skylarks were recorded from just over 75 % of the country, being absent only from forested areas and the higher parts of the Southern Alps, and uncommon along the west coast of the South Island. At a finer scale, skylarks are more common on farms with less woody vegetation.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The skylark population size in New Zealand is not known, but it is a common species. The average breeding-season density on pastoral sheep farms on the Canterbury Plains was estimated at about 22 birds per km2, higher than on dairy (13 birds per km2) and mixed cropping arable farms (10 birds per km2) in the same region. Similar densities have been reported from the Chatham Islands (10 birds per km2). Reported densities on some sheep and beef farms in Otago are considerably lower (about 5 birds per km2).</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts </strong></p>\n<p>Skylarks cause some damage in croplands by pecking newly-sown seeds and pulling up germinating seedlings, but early concerns about this have diminished with the shift from cereal cropping to pastoral farming.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Female skylarks build a neat grass-lined cup nest on the ground, often within or beneath an overhanging clump of grass or rush. Nesting occurs between September and January, during which time a pair may produce 2-3 clutches of up to five densely brown-speckled greyish eggs. The speckling is denser at the broad end of the egg, often forming a ring. Average clutch size in New Zealand is about 9% smaller than of birds breeding in their natural range in Europe, a feature perhaps selected for by a less strongly seasonal environment and longer breeding season locally. (A similar reduction in clutch size is apparent in 10 other introduced species here.) Only the female incubates the eggs, although both parents feed the nestlings, the male contributing up to half the food brought to the nest.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Skylark pairs are monogamous and strong territorial during the breeding season, but often gregarious outside it, especially at concentrated seed sources. In one European study, however, DNA fingerprinting of chicks revealed that in over a quarter of broods, and up to 20% of chicks, the female had mated with a male other than her partner. Between August and January, territorial males perform distinctive aerial displays in which a bird flies steeply upwards, singing as it goes, eventually levelling off 30-100 m above ground, at which point it is little more than a speck in the sky. There it hovers or circles slowly, singing continuously for 3-5 minutes (sometimes longer), before parachuting down with wings and tails held out stiffly, still singing, ending with a steep dive towards the ground for the last 15 m or so. The song is a rippling sequence of melodic notes, occasionally including phrases of other species&#x2019; songs and calls. One pair giving distraction displays near a nest containing young chicks gave the <em>pit</em> alarm calls of banded dotterel, itself nesting in the same area.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Skylarks mostly eat seeds, especially those of grasses but including cereals, clover and weeds; also invertebrates such as beetles, flies, spiders, bugs and larvae of various groups. Nestlings are fed initially on invertebrates. This largely granivorous diet contrasts with the New Zealand pipit, which feeds primarily on invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Webpages</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nosleepingdogs.wordpress.com/poems-in-which-skylarks-appear/\">http://nosleepingdogs.wordpress.com/poems-in-which-skylarks-appear/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Skylark\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Skylark</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/skylark.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/skylark.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Beauchamp, A.J. 1998.

Like many Australian wetland birds, they are long-lived and well able to cope with the climatically-induced variable breeding conditions of the interior. Gull-billed terns and other wetland birds are forced to find new habitats when the temporary wetlands are consumed by drought, and it is during post-flood droughts that gull-billed terns are likely to reach New Zealand. There is also a smaller, migratory Asian subspecies (<em>affinis</em>) that reaches Australia as part of its non-breeding range. This could overshoot and reach New Zealand too, but it has not yet been recorded here.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The gull-billed tern is a large, heavily built and thick-billed tern, with characteristically long legs. The back and upper wings are a very pale grey while the tail, body and under wings are white. The upper wings may have dark grey feathers on the outer leading edge of the primaries and there is a dark grey trailing edge to the lower surface of the outer primaries too. This darkens and becomes more conspicuous as the feathers wear. Adults in breeding plumage have a solid black cap from the base of the bill extending to just below the eye and well down the nape. In nonbreeding plumage there is a very large black eye patch and the crown and nape are lightly streaked or washed with grey. Sub-adult birds have a head pattern like a non-breeding adult but also have a more extensive dark bar along the trailing edge of the wing and may have other dark markings on upperwing, but the heavily speckled backs of newly fledged birds are unlikely to be seen in New Zealand. The bill, legs and eye are black.</p>\n<p>Gull-billed terns fly with slow, steady wing beats, swooping to snatch prey from the ground. This dropping and rising flight is fairly distinctive, and they may also hawk insects in the air. Unusually for a tern, their long legs enable them to walk easily and even run, and so their stance may show some resemblance to a small gull.</p>\n<p>Voice: gull-billed terns are generally silent except near breeding colonies, where most calls are given in response to intruders &#x2013; normally a staccato guttural <em>gek-gek-gek.</em></p>\n<p>Similar species: gull-billed terns have a heavy build like a Caspian tern, but are much smaller (with the body length of a white-fronted tern) and have a black, rather than orange bill. They are as pale on the back as a white-fronted tern, but are markedly heavier in the body and bill, with much longer legs. In flight gull-billed terns resemble a small gull in size and shape (especially black-billed gull, which may hawk insects in flight). Gull-billed terns in flight do not have black-and-white wing-tip pattern of gulls, and also have a much heavier bill, and more pointed wings.</p>\n<p>The Australian-breeding subspecies <em>macrotarsa </em>is the form known to occur in New Zealand. It has a long, heavy bill that may appear to droop slightly as it is curved along the top. The eye patch in nonbreeding birds is large, extending to the ear and well below the eye. The Asian subspecies <em>affinis</em> (not yet identified in New Zealand) is smaller, and has a short straight bill sharpening abruptly at the tip. In nonbreeding plumage they have a white eyelid and much smaller eye patch that is often separated from the small ear patch (or may be joined to it by a thin line). A less obvious difference from the larger subspecies is the slightly darker back, which contrasts more with the white rump.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, gull-billed terns prefer shallow, often temporary, areas of freshwater, but they are also found on sheltered coastal waters especially during dry periods. They feed over water or surrounding grassland. In New Zealand they are usually found on harbours and estuaries but sometimes on coastal lakes and farmland.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The first gull-billed terns noticed in New Zealand were two found at the Invercargill airport during the winter of 1955. Since then they have occurred reasonably frequently with one or two reported somewhere around New Zealand in most years, especially since the 1970s. Birds that arrive often appear to remain in New Zealand for a year or more. One notable long stayer in Hawkes Bay apparently arrived with a second bird in 1982 and was recorded annually up to 1996.&#xA0; Larger groups included eight on the Manukau Harbour in 1976-77, five at Marahau near Motueka in 1990, and six on the Kaipara Harbour in 2001. The largest influx yet recorded started in June 2011 with up to six birds seen on the Manawatu estuary, up to 16 on the Manukau Harbour, up to 15 on Lake Forsyth and Lake Ellesmere, and five on Lake Wairarapa, with 1-2 birds seen at many other sites. The timing of these sightings differed, suggesting that the same birds moved about the country over two years but probably at least 20 birds were in New Zealand, and a few were still present&#xA0;until at least&#xA0;2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In New Zealand, gull-billed terns mainly use coastal habitats. They roost in flocks (when multiple birds are present), often with, or near, flocks of roosting waders, gulls and terns. They may feed in loose flocks too. They fly easily, swooping with great precision to pick up food from the surface of the ground or mudflats, occasionally landing briefly to do so. Birds on the Manukau Harbour made shallow dives to take crabs under shallow water. They also hawk insects on the wing.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>A variety of animal prey is taken, with invertebrates (including worms, and a variety of insects and crustaceans), fish and small terrestrial vertebrates such as lizards and mice recorded in Australia. In New Zealand they commonly eat crabs taken from the mudflats or in shallow water,&#xA0;also worms and other invertebrates taken from ploughed land and on pasture, and redpolls caught from winter flocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull-billed_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull-billed_Tern</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It is an attractive sleek species whose guttural&#xA0;call is often heard before the bird is seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Caspian tern is the largest of all species of terns. With its 1 metre wingspan, it is similar in size to a black-backed gull. Caspian terns are silver-grey above and white below, with dark wing tips. The tail is relatively short and only slightly forked compared to other terns. The large bill is mostly bright red in adults, becoming dark near the tip, with the extreme tip &#xA0;yellowish (only apparent at close range). Adults have black legs and a black cap to below the eye during the breeding season. The cap becomes speckled with white and less sharply delineated at other times of the year. Juveniles have some brown mottling on the back that is lost during the first autumn moult, while the diffuse brown cap is retained for longer. The bill is orange and smaller than adults at first. The legs and feet may be dull orange or black. The flight of Caspian terns is direct, with purposeful shallow beats.</p>\n<p>Voice: a distinctive harsh <em>&apos;karh&apos;</em> is often given in flight, particularly around breeding colonies.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the Caspian tern is substantially larger than any other tern in New Zealand. The next largest species, the crested tern (a rare vagrant) is half the size by weight, and has a yellow bill. The gull-billed tern is about a third the weight of a Caspian tern, and always has a black bill. Caspian terns are sometimes mistaken for large gulls by inexperienced observers.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Caspian terns are very widely distributed around the world. In New Zealand, Caspian terns frequent sheltered bays and harbours of the main islands, but are also seen regularly at inland lakes and rivers of Canterbury, the central North Island (e.g. Lake Taupo and Rotorua) and Waikato (e.g. Lake Ngaroto and Lake Whakamaru on the Waikato River). There is a single record of a vagrant bird from the Kermadec Islands, and two from the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p>Caspian terns breed mainly on open coastal shellbanks and sandspits, and occasionally on braided river beds and at inland lakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>There is little evidence of Caspian terns in coastal deposits of subfossil bones in New Zealand, indicating that they may have colonised recently or had a very restricted distribution here until the early 20th century. Although widespread now, Caspian terns remain uncommon in New Zealand, with around 1300-1400 breeding pairs estimated.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Caspian terns are susceptible to nest disturbance by people, their dogs, and off-road vehicles. Southern black-backed gulls and red-billed gulls may attack eggs and chicks following disturbance by people. Like other shore-nesting birds, chicks and eggs are vulnerable to predation by introduced mammalian predators such as cats, stoats and ferrets.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Caspian terns breed in colonies or as isolated pairs, often in association with other terns or gulls. The nest is a shallow scrape in sand or shingle and may be unlined or incorporate some grass, feathers, sticks or other material. The two parents share incubation of a clutch of 1&#x2013;3 dark speckled light grey or olive-brown eggs for 21&#x2013;28 days. Eggs are laid from late September through to late December. Chicks are fed whole regurgitated fish by both parents. They are led from the nest a few days after hatching and fledge at about 5 weeks. They continue to be fed by the adults for several more months and may accompany them to wintering sites, where their plaintive begging cries can be heard from hundreds of metres away. Caspian terns first breed when 3-4 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Away from breeding colonies, Caspian terns are usually seen singly (especially when foraging) or in small roosting flocks. Their usual hunting method is to fly up to 15 m above the surface of the water, then diving steeply on to prey, often becoming completely submerged in the process. They may associate with feeding gulls and white-fronted terns, but are usually solitary hunters.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Caspian terns feed mostly on small surface-swimming fish such as yellow-eyed mullet, piper, and smelt. Fish are caught by plunge-diving and usually swallowed in flight. They have also been recorded feeding on crickets and marine worms caught by probing in soft mud and wading in shallow water.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/caspiantern.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/caspiantern.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Barlow, M. 1995.

The white-winged black tern breeds from eastern Europe and Middle East to Manchuria, and birds migrate to equatorial and temperate parts of Africa, Asia and Australasia. They have nested occasionally in New Zealand, the most recent record being in 2015. In New Zealand white-winged black terns are most often seen in the summer months when they are in pale non-breeding plumage. They favour coastal lagoons and estuaries where they feed mainly in flight, dipping down to the water to catch surface insects. In some years a few birds are seen whose physiology and breeding cycles are geared to the southern hemisphere; these birds inhabit different sites, typically inland riverbeds and associated wetlands, often in the company of black-fronted terns.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The white-winged black tern is a small tern, with unmistakable breeding plumage - black head and body and mainly white wings and tail, and reddish bill and legs. In non-breeding plumage, they are predominantly white and grey, including entirely white underparts and blackish bill and legs. The only black feathers are on the head, typically a club-shaped area behind the eyes and linking with variable blackish markings on the hind crown and nape; the back and wings mainly grey. The carpal bar is greyish black and conspicuous at rest. Compared with other New Zealand terns, white-winged terns have a very buoyant flight.</p>\n<p>Voice: a rasping <em>kreek-kreek</em> call is given on New Zealand riverbeds and breeding grounds, also increasingly as birds moult into breeding plumage before migration.</p>\n<p>Similar species: non-breeding black-fronted and whiskered terns lack the club-shaped markings of the head. Non-breeding black tern (a vagrant to Australia, not recorded from New Zealand) is separable only after careful observation.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>White-winged black terns breed from eastern Europe and Middle East to Manchuria, and winter south to South Africa, south-east Asia and Australasia. Migrants to New Zealand occur at many lagoons and estuaries from Northland to Southland, with largest groups recorded in Bay of Plenty, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, Marlborough and especially Canterbury. Birds in breeding plumage in the New Zealand summer (&#x201C;southern cycle&#x201D; birds) have been recorded on many riverbeds and associated wetlands from Southland to Marlborough, most often in Canterbury. The four New Zealand breeding records have been from Canterbury and Marlborough.</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>White-winged black terns are summer migrants to New Zealand, favouring shallow coastal lagoons and small estuaries and associated wetlands, less often large harbours. These preferred sites provide habitat for emerging insects e.g. midges, craneflies and other flies, upon which the terns feed.</p>\n<p>Breeding habitat in New Zealand is markedly different to that in the northern hemisphere, comprising braided riverbeds and their coastal lagoons, in the presence of black-fronted colonies (cf. nesting on floating vegetation in swamps in Eurasia). Riverbed habitat includes flood-prone main river channels and neighbouring stable sidestreams. Many of these riverbeds also have nearby wetlands &#x2013; ponds, swamps, ephemeral wetlands &#x2013; which are used for foraging.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Probably fewer than 20 white-winged black terns visit New Zealand annually, mostly made up of migrants from the northern hemisphere, i.e. plumages follow the northern hemisphere cycle. In some years no &#x201C;southern cycle&#x201D; birds are detected in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>In the northern hemisphere, white-winged black terns breed colonially in marshes with nests on floating or shore vegetation. The four New Zealand breeding records are from the lower Rakaia River (1917, 3 chicks fledged), Opihi River, South Canterbury (December-February 1973-74), upper Acheron River, Marlborough (December 2012), and near Twizel (January 2015). In 1973-74,&#xA0;a solitary pair bred on the edge of a small black-fronted tern colony at a lagoon front at the mouth of a shingle riverbed. The first nest failed and a second nest produced a chick which appeared not to have fledged. The 2012 and 2015 breeding records were also of single pairs associated with black-fronted tern colonies, with both nests failing due to predation.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The white-winged black tern is a typical marsh tern, dependent on extensive shallow freshwater habitat that supports abundant aquatic insects. In New Zealand, this requirement reflects the separation of sightings into two habitat types &#x2013; shallow coastal wetlands and inland braided riverbeds. Other species of terns in New Zealand, particularly black-fronted tern, appear to provide social stimulation for breeding of this otherwise colonial species.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>White-winged black terns are primarily insectivorous, specialising on aquatic insects captured by dipping, hawking or occasionally plunging; occasionally also terrestrial insects.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-winged_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-winged_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=828\">http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=828</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Both of these attributes probably help to drive the occasional vagrant to New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Whiskered terns are a little smaller than the more common medium sized terns in New Zealand, and have a distinctively short and shallowly-forked tail.

The legs are fairly long and they and the bill are dark red. In non-breeding plumage they are paler, especially on the breast and belly, the crown becomes pale, finely streaked with black and a narrow black band runs across the nape from eye to eye. The bill becomes black with a reddish tinge at the base and the feet and legs are blackish.</p>\n<p>Feeding whiskered terns have a buoyant flight, less direct than marine species.

These birds are smaller, slimmer with a finer bill and may have irregular black blotches on the body during moult. Black-fronted terns have similar plumages to whiskered tern, but always have grey plumage and a white rump (cf. grey in whiskered tern) while their bills and feet are orange rather than red.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Almost all of the recent breeding records of whiskered terns in Australia come from the south-east but after breeding they move north to northern Australia, New Guinea and Indonesia. They are a freshwater tern, rarely found over brackish waters or sheltered harbours. They are sensitive to rainfall, moving&#xA0;to temporary wetlands when they form, and retreating to permanent water in the dry season. They often breed on flood waters, and colonies may form very quickly when conditions are right.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There have been about 10 sightings of whiskered terns in New Zealand, some of which have yet to be submitted to the Records Appraisal Committee of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand. The sightings include: Lake Horowhenua (2 birds, August-October 1977, May to September 1978), Lower Waikato River (August-September 1978), Pukekohe (March 1980), Lake Rotorua (May 1987), Bromley Oxidation Ponds, Christchurch (December 2005), Blenheim Sewage Ponds (January 2006), Lake Grassmere (February 2006; the last three records probably refer to the same bird), Travis Wetland, Christchurch (May 2007), and North Kaipara Head (October 2009).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia whiskered terns often forage in small flocks, but apart from the first sighting, all New Zealand records have been&#xA0;single birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Whiskered terns take a variety of small animals, particularly insects, fish and crustaceans, but frogs, mice and lizards have also been recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskered_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskered_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3290\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3290</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Brown, B.; Habraken, A. 1979. <a href=\"http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/whiskered-tern-lower-walkato-river\">Whiskered Tern on lower Walkato River</a>.

They breed on the braided rivers of the eastern South Island, dispersing to coastal areas after breeding; it is during this time that some birds are seen in the North Island. The black-fronted tern is an attractive and highly distinctive bird in breeding plumage, with the slate grey plumage contrasting with the black cap and bright orange bill. Juveniles and immature birds may be confused with other vagrant tern species but all are easily separable. In addition to feeding on rivers, estuaries and offshore waters black-fronted tern are often observed flying over pasture and arable fields with their distinctive buoyant flight, hawking insects and picking worms from the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>A familiar tern of the eastern South Island, the black-fronted tern is a distinctive small grey tern with a moderately forked tail, very short legs and short bill sharply decurved at the tip. The adults are striking in breeding plumage, with the pale grey body plumage contrasting with the black cap, narrow white cheek stripe and bright orange bill. In non-breeding plumage, they have a mottled grey cap, a black patch around the eye and ear coverts, and a black tip to the bill. Juvenile and immature birds are similar to non-breeding adults, but have the crown and nape more heavily streaked or mottled black, some buff scaling on the back, and the bill is dark brown with some dull orange at the base.</p>\n<p>Voice: black-fronted terns are noisy at colonies, especially when attacking intruders by diving, calling harshly and often striking the intruder&#x2019;s head. The usual call is a repetitive &#x201C;kit&#x201D;. Away from colonies, roosting and feeding birds are usually silently.</p>\n<p>Similar species: vagrant whiskered tern has similar breeding and non-breeding plumage but is much smaller, with proportionally shorter wings and a shorter, less deeply forked tail, and grey rump. Black-fronted terns can also be confused with non-breeding white-winged black tern which is much smaller, lacks a forked tail and has distinctive black &#x201C;ear muff&#x201D; patches&#xA0;behind the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted terns breed only on the braided riverbeds of the eastern and southern South Island, from Marlborough to Southland. They are found on or near braided channels of inland rivers and streams, often at high altitudes, and on nearby farmland, either under pasture or cultivation. They are less often seen over scrub and tussock. After breeding, birds disperse to coastal areas roosting in sheltered harbours, estuaries and lagoons, foraging mostly offshore but also on near-coastal farmland. Small numbers of black-fronted terns visit the North Island in winter, mainly to Wellington, Wairarapa and Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, but occasionally as far north as the Kaipara Harbour. They were formerly regular in the Bay of Plenty, but are now scarce there.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The black-fronted tern has a small global population, with an estimated population of between 5-10,000 individuals. Many rivers hold only small breeding populations, with over 50% of the black-fronted terns breeding on a handful of rivers. The population has declined significantly since European settlement and is continuing to do so. Black-fronted terns gather in winter flocks of up to 300 birds (and occasionally as many as 1000 birds) at coastal estuaries and lagoons.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted terns breed in a dynamic habitat, and as a result they are threatened by a wide range of factors. These include habitat loss due to hydroelectricity development, weed encroachment of braided river breeding habitat, and recreational use of rivers. But the most significant impact is predation by introduced mammalian predators. Black-fronted terns and their nests are preyed on by rats, stoats, ferrets, feral cats, and hedgehogs. In addition, on some rivers there is significant predation by southern black-backed gulls and swamp harriers, both of which species have become more numerous following human-induced alteration of their habitat and food supply.</p>\n<p>Black-fronted tern and other braided river birds have been the focus of a range of conservation actions in attempts to increase their productivity. This includes predator control, weed management, and advocacy with gravel extraction firms on a number of rivers or river sections. Despite this, pest control has had limited success in improving breeding success of black-fronted tern and the challenges of protecting braided river birds in a habitat as dynamic as a braided river has not yet fully been accomplished.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted terns are colonial breeders. Nests are placed on shingle bands on braided rivers, away from vegetation, and are simple scrapes in sand or amongst river stones, lined with a few fine twigs. Most colonies are small, typically 2-50 pairs, but they can contain up to 250 pairs. Nests are widely spaced within colonies, with 0.4 nest/ 100m&#xB2; (range 0.1-2.9 nests/100m&#xB2;). Laying occurs from October to December, and sometimes into January. Late eggs are probably replacement clutches. 1-3 eggs are laid, although most nests have 2 eggs. Incubation is shared and lasts 25 days. Chicks leave the nest 1-3 days after hatching, often moving away from the colony. Parents feed chicks on invertebrates and small fish and skinks carried back to the chicks in their bill. Chicks fledge after 4 weeks and are fed by adults for at least two weeks after fledging. Black-fronted terns first breed at two years old. Adults return to the same river to breed each year, although colony location can shift between years.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted tern usually feed solitarily over river channels, but can form flocks when feeding over pasture, in particular when following a plough. On rivers they repeatedly work a channel, working their way up stream before circling back around to start over. They obtain food by contact-dipping (dipping to touch the surface with their bill only) to take emergent nymph mayflies and stoneflies, or plunge diving to take small fish. Birds from a colony in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland specialise in catching skinks on the river flats.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>During the breeding season black-fronted terns feed on emerging nymph and subimago mayflies and stoneflies or small fish or in nearby fields or river flats on earthworms, grass grub larvae and skinks. After breeding, most birds move to the coast where they feed in coastal waters up to 50 km from shore, taking mostly planktonic crustaceans. They also often feed over wet pasture on earthworms, especially during rough weather.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3289\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3289</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It is mainly a marine species that is seldom found far from the coast. The name &#x2018;white-fronted&#x2019; refers to the &#x2018;frons&#x2019; or forehead, where a thin strip of white separates the black cap from the black bill. Most other &#x2018;capped&#x2019; terns, including the black-fronted tern, have black caps that reach the bill when in breeding plumage. The scientific name <em>striata</em> refers to the finely-barred (striated) dorsal plumage of recently fledged white-fronted terns, as the original description and name was based on a juvenile bird painted by William Ellis, surgeon&#x2019;s second mate on the <em>Discovery</em>, on Captain Cook&#x2019;s third visit to New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The white-fronted tern is a medium-sized, long-tailed sea tern that is common around New Zealand coasts. It is pale grey above and white below, with a black cap that is separated from the bill by a white band (or by an entirely white fore-crown in non-breeding plumage). The tail is white and forked; the length of the tail and depth of the fork decrease in size outside of the breeding season. The outer edge of the first primary has a narrow black or brownish-black band. In the breeding season, the black cap extends from the white frontal strip down to the back of neck. Outside of the breeding season the cap recedes, leaving the forehead white. The eyelids, eyes and bill are black, and the legs vary from black to dull red-brown. Sexes are similar but females are slightly smaller. Immature birds are similar to non-breeding adults. They have the black nape streaked with white and the wing coverts and distinctive light brown mottling. Recently fledged birds have fine blackish barring (striations) over the back and wing coverts.</p>\n<p>Voice: the main call is a high-pitched <em>siet</em>; a harsh <em>keark</em> or <em>keeahk</em> is uttered by birds defending their nests.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the white-fronted tern is easily distinguished from the two other widespread New Zealand tern species (the much larger Caspian tern, and smaller, darker black-fronted tern), but is very similar to the Arctic tern and especially the common tern, which are rare visitors to New Zealand. The white-fronted tern is the largest and palest of the three species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>White-fronted terns are common all around New Zealand coasts. They occasionally forage up larger Canterbury rivers, but are seldom found far from the coast. Breeding occurs mainly on the coast of New Zealand and its outlying islands, Stewart, Chatham, and Auckland Islands, and off northeast Tasmania at Flinders and Cape Barren Islands<strong>. </strong>Most of the terns remain in New Zealand during the winter, but in autumn some white-fronted terns, mostly immatures, disperse to south-eastern Australia. These wintering terns are frequently seen on the coasts of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand population has declined markedly over the last 40 years and is currently regarded as At Risk/Declining.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>White-fronted terns often breed in ephemeral sites such as river beds, estuaries or river mouths that are subjected to frequent flooding<strong>. </strong>They nest in dense colonies which provide little protection against predation by introduced mammalian predators such as stoats, ferrets, cats, and rats. White-fronted terns often nest adjacent to red-billed gull colonies and some gulls, especially males, specialise in preying on the eggs and chicks of terns. Colonies of nesting terns are vulnerable to disturbance by people and their dogs.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Breeding usually occurs in large dense colonies on shingle river beds, sand dunes, stacks and cliffs. Sometimes a site will be used in successive seasons, but usually the birds change sites in successive years even if they were successful at a specific site the previous season. Terns tend to arrive at a prospective nesting location only a few days before laying, and there is a high degree of synchronisation of laying within a colony. The 1-3 (usually 1) eggs are laid in a slight depression on the bare ground without any nesting material. Often small stones are brought in to line the bottom of the nest. At Kaikoura in 1976, of 180 nests, 81% contained one egg and 19% two.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Pair-bonds are retained from one season to the next. Before laying, the male courtship-feeds the female, presenting small fish to her. Predators or humans entering a colony are repeatedly dived at.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>White-fronted terns feed on small and larval fish at sea, in lagoons or up rivers. At sea it frequently feeds in shoaling fish swarms associated with kahawai, gulls and shearwaters. Flocks of white-fronted terns feeding over shoals of pelagic fish often attract the attention of fishers wishing to troll for kahawai, giving rise to the tern&#x2019;s alternative name of kahawai bird. Feeding terns dive from 5-10 m above the surface<strong>. </strong>The forked tail enables the bird to manoeuvre extremely well, which is an advantage in foraging for small fish<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Websites </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whitefrontedtern.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/whitefrontedtern.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3267\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3267</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Clark, W.C.; Dawson, E.W. 1957.

Unlike its northern counterpart, the Arctic tern, New Zealand Antarctic terns do not undertake spectacular migrations after breeding, but is likely to remain close to the breeding islands all year. When feeding on shoals of small fish or swarms of crustaceans they may form flocks of up to 100 birds.</p>\n<p>The same species is widely distributed around subantarctic islands of the southern hemisphere, as well as exposed rocky areas of the Antarctic mainland. The more southern populations migrate northwards after breeding e.g., those Antarctic terns that breed on the Kerguelen archipelago overwinter in southern Africa.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Antarctic tern is a medium-sized tern with a white rump and forked tail. In breeding plumage adults have a black cap down to a bright red bill, with white cheeks, an even grey body, and wings with black only on the outer edge of the outer primary; the legs are red. In non-breeding plumage the black cap recedes to just behind the eyes, the underparts become white and the bill becomes dull reddish-black. Juveniles initially are marked buff, grey and white on the back, with markedly buff flanks; the bill is dull black and the legs are dull red.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: &#x201C;<em>trr-trr-kriah</em>&#x201D; is the main call when in flight and fishing. A &#x201C;<em>chrrrr</em>&#x201D; is given when defending its nest against intruders, and a high-pitched call is used to summon their mate</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: most likely to be confused with migrant Arctic terns. The latter are usually in non-breeding plumage when adult Antarctic terns are in breeding plumage. Arctic terns usually are shorter-legged and have more extensive dark markings on the outer edge of the outer primaries than do Antarctic terns. In addition, immature Arctic terns have a marked dark carpal bar, which is absent in Antarctic terns.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antarctic terns can co-occur with white-fronted terns at The Snares, Auckland &#xA0;and Campbell Islands. The latter are larger, paler, and have a longer, fine, black bill than Antarctic terns in any plumage.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antarctic terns breed at all New Zealand subantarctic islands, plus on some of the muttonbird islands off southern Stewart Island. During the breeding season (September-April) Antarctic terns do not range far at sea, and so are usually seen within 2 km of the breeding islands. At the northern breeding sites (islands off Stewart Island, The Snares), adults and young usually stay in nearby coastal waters, but farther south they tend to be absent April-October. They are assumed to be out in the southern ocean, as Antarctic terns have not been recorded north of Foveaux Strait.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">An estimated 1000 breeding pairs, but no systematic surveys completed except at The Snares where a minimum of 65 breeding pairs were present during the 1980s.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Populations on many breeding islands, such as The Snares and Campbell Islands, are secure in the absence of introduced mammalian predators. On the Antipodes mice may affect breeding success. On Auckland Island feral cats, pigs and mice are likely to affect breeding success and to prey upon adults and young.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antarctic terns are usually colonial breeders, although they may also nest as isolated pairs or small groups. Nests may be on bare rocky or gravel areas, or among light vegetation such as tussock or small <em>Hebe</em>. The laying season is prolonged and varies from island to island. For example, it is September-March at The Snares, October-March at Campbell Island, December-March at the Antipodes, and November-February at the Auckland Islands. The nest is a shallow scrape or depression, usually lined with flattened vegetation. The clutch size is typically 1-2. Both members of the pair incubate the eggs and feed the young.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Antarctic terns feed close inshore, either singly or in flocks, catching prey by contact dipping (i.e. submerging the bill whilst flying) or plunge diving to become completely submerged. Single birds may defend a feeding area, chasing off conspecifics whilst uttering a loud &#x201C;<em>chrrrrrr</em>&#x201D;. During the breeding season they defend the nest site against any intruders by repeated dive bombing, occasionally striking them with their sharp bill. After the breeding season, Antarctic terns tend to form flocks at well-established roosts on rocky promontories adjacent to the sea. The age of first breeding is 3 years and with an estimated annual survival of 94% the average life-span is 17 years, with the oldest birds surviving over 30 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Small fish and crustaceans.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3272\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3272</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bailey, A.M.; Sorensen, J.H. 1962.

New Zealand&#x2019;s abundant white-fronted tern is slightly larger in all dimensions and, in breeding plumage, its black cap never extends to the base of its bill. The vagrant common tern is also a slightly larger bird with a more robust bill. Common terns (in New Zealand) and white-fronted terns never have red bills. Antarctic terns are extremely similar to Arctic terns but are confined to the very south of the New Zealand region. The breeding/non-breeding plumage cycle of the Antarctic tern is the opposite of that for Arctic tern, they have relatively longer legs, and have less black on the outer wing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Arctic terns nest in Arctic and subarctic regions and annually migrate to and from the Antarctic, where they mainly feed near the edge of the pack-ice. Adults begin migration south from July to October along three known migration routes (eastern Pacific; western and eastern Atlantic); northern migration routes (from March-May) are over deeper waters. Arctic terns are mainly pelagic in the southern hemisphere, living out of sight of land. In New Zealand they are most often seen roosting with white-fronted terns on beaches or at river mouths.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The Arctic tern is rarely seen in New Zealand, but is probably an annual migrant in low numbers. They are most commonly seen on their southern migration in November, but records span September to June. Most records have been of single birds, however small flocks of up to four birds have been reported. A chick banded in 27 June 2003 in Sweden was recovered dead on Stewart Island on 1 December 2003.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Arctic terns are gregarious, and in New Zealand they are most often seen roosting among flocks of white-fronted terns.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Feeding Arctic terns normally hover and plunge, catching prey from just below the surface. They mainly eat small fish, but there are no data from New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1049640/overview\">http://eol.org/pages/1049640/overview</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Edgar, A.T. 1961.

It is similar in appearance to some other tern species, particularly the white-fronted tern, and so is very hard to identify. The common tern was first positively identified in New Zealand only in 1984.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The common tern is a small to medium-sized tern which has distinct breeding and non-breeding plumages. It is light grey above, has red or black legs, and a straight black bill. The most widespread subspecies <em>S. h. hirundo</em>, which has reached Australia but not yet New Zealand, has an orange-red bill with a black tip when in breeding plumage. All subspecies in breeding plumage have a black cap extending over their nape and crown to the base of their bill. Birds in non-breeding plumage have the black cap receded to above their eyes, and have a variable dark &#x2018;cubital bar&#x2019; on the inner upperwing. Juveniles are similar to adults in non-breeding plumage but have brown tips to some of their dorsal feathers.</p>\n<p>Voice: a short <em>kik</em> and a raspy <em>kreer</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: easily confused with other medium-sized tern species and only distinguished with care. In New Zealand, common terns are frequently confused with the white-fronted tern, which is slightly larger and has slightly paler dorsal plumage. If seen in breeding plumage, the black cap of the common tern extends to the base of the bill, so it is unlike the plumage of the white-fronted tern, which always has a white strip between its bill and its black cap. The common tern is also similar to the rare Arctic tern, which is smaller, normally has shorter legs, sometimes has a red bill, and has a whiter crown in non-breeding plumage. A vagrant non-breeding Antarctic tern is another&#xA0;species that could be&#xA0;confused&#xA0;with common and Arctic terns, but Antarctic terns have not been reported north of Foveaux Strait.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The eastern subspecies of the common tern is on its nesting grounds from May to September. In the non-breeding season it migrates south to coastal areas including Australasia. The southern migration begins in August-September and birds fly north again from February. In New Zealand, common terns are mainly found on the coast, but are occasionally found on inland waterways. There are many pelagic records from Australia (i.e. birds seen well offshore). Common terns usually associate with white-fronted terns in New Zealand, but are often on the edge of a flock.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The common tern is a rare vagrant to New Zealand, but is probably an annual visitor that is often over-looked. The first confirmed record was from Pukerua Bay, north of Wellington, in January 1984. It has since been reported almost every year from locations in the North Island; there are also a few South Island records. The majority of sightings have been from the Manawatu River estuary, Kapiti coast and Bay of Plenty river mouths, but this may partly reflect observer effort and awareness. Common terns are normally seen in New Zealand from November to April.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Common terns are gregarious, however most New Zealand records have been of single birds, most of which were associating with white-fronted terns.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Prey (mainly small fish) is normally taken by surface or shallow plunging and occasional dipping.

A crested tern was apparently resident around Wellington for about 15 years from the early 1980s, and was seen regularly in Wellington Harbour, and at Pukerua Bay and Waikanae Estuary.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>This tern is unmistakable if seen clearly. Its large size combined with its prominent yellow bill is unique in the New Zealand area. The species is grey above and white below with a black cap and a deeply forked tail. In breeding plumage, the black feathers on its nape form a small shaggy crest. In non-breeders the black on the crown recedes and is streaked with white. Juveniles have a more smudgy crown, black tips to many of their upper feathers and a less deeply forked tail. The legs and feet are black. The species has a rakish yet graceful appearance in flight .</p>\n<p>Voice: whistles, harsh guttural or short sharp cries; the common flight call is <em>kerrak</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the crested tern is about half the size of a Caspian tern, which has a prominent red bill. Smaller terns are readily separable by size and most have either a red or black bill. Little terns and fairy terns sometimes have yellow or orange coloured bills but are much smaller (50-70 g). Lesser crested terns (<em>Sterna bengalensis</em>) have never been recorded from New Zealand but occur in northern Australia so they might reach New Zealand; they are smaller with a more orange-coloured bill (Higgins &amp; Davies 1996).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The crested tern has a wide distribution from South Africa to the Persian Gulf, and through South-east Asia and Indonesia to Australia and Polynesia. New Zealand birds are believed to be of the form that occurs from South-east Asia&#xA0;east to the Tuamotu Archipelago. &#xA0;Crested terns are considered to be sedentary, but after breeding, birds sometimes disperse. It is primarily a coastal species, often seen on islands, at estuaries, or in harbours roosting on beaches, rocks or objects such as jetties. It is sometimes seen further out to sea, but is rarely found inland.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The crested tern is a rare vagrant to New Zealand with 13 records only. The first record was from the Kermadec Islands in 1910. Since the 1960s the species has been reported from Spirits Bay, Waipu, Auckland,&#xA0;Firth of Thames, Maketu, Napier, New Plymouth, Manawatu, Wellington, Farewell Spit, Kaikoura and in Canterbury (off Southshore Spit and at Washdyke Lagoon). One was apparently resident around Wellington from 1981-1995.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Crested terns nest in dense colonies, with seasonal patterns varying between sites. They are gregarious, however all New Zealand records have been of single birds, often associating with white-fronted terns.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Crested terns mainly eat fish, occasionally prawns and squid. They occasionally scavenge offal from boats; there is no information on diet from New Zealand.

Though still relatively abundant, numbers of birds throughout the South Island have rapidly declined. Nevertheless, colonies can still number in the thousands. The black-billed gull is found only in New Zealand, unlike our two other common gull species. They are less likely to be found in towns and cities than the other gulls, and are not commonly observed scavenging for food. Interestingly, though declining overall, the black-billed gull has expanded its breeding range in the North Island in the last few decades, and now breeds as far north as the Kaipara Harbour.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The black-billed gull is more slender than the red-billed gull, with a longer bill. Breeding adults have a white head, neck, rump, tail and underparts, and pale silver-grey wings and back. The outer primaries are mainly white with white-tipped black margins. A diagnostic white leading edge to the wing shows in flight. The bill and legs are black; during late incubation and hatching&#xA0;the legs become vibrant blood red. The eye is white, and the eye-ring red. Non-breeding adults have a bi-coloured bill, reddish at the base with a black tip and line through the middle. During autumn-winter, all ages may have a grey patch above, below and in front of the eye. Immature (2nd year) birds have a grey eye, black eye-ring, bi-coloured bill (pinkish red with dark grey-black tip and line through middle) and pinkish-red legs (some almost orange). Juveniles have variable amounts of grey-brown on the crown and ears, lost during late summer-autumn.&#xA0; The tail is white, sometimes with a grey-brown subterminal band. The wing is pale silver-grey with brownish terminal margins; large brown-black tips to the tertials and a dark carpal bar are retained through the first year. In flight, juveniles have a dark trailing edge to secondaries and white-tipped primaries. The black outer webs of the primaries are variable, distinctly darker than adults, thus the predominantly white leading fore edge of adults is absent. The bill is bi-coloured, dull pale pink with a dark grey-black tip; the eye is black, the eye-ring is grey-black and the legs are dull pale pink.</p>\n<p>Voice: typical gull-like calls, including constant chatter from breeding colonies.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: in non-breeding plumage, black-billed gulls have a bi-coloured bill and red legs, and may be confused with red-billed gulls. Juvenile black-billed gulls are most confusing, as they have a dark outer leading edge to the wing (this is white in older age classes). In all plumages, black-billed gull has a longer, finer bill. Red-billed gull is darker grey with a black patch through the middle of the outer primaries, diagnostic in flight. The red bill (which is shorter and thicker) and legs lose the brighter tones of summer during autumn-winter. Adult red-billed gulls do not acquire a contrasting bi-coloured bill, though do have darker shades of red near the tip and through the middle of the bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black-billed gulls mostly breed on sparsely-vegetated gravels on inland riverbeds. The majority of the population nests in Southland, with only c.5% nesting in the North Island. In Southland, colonies are found on braided rivers through to single-channel rivers and streams with gravel beds. Occasionally birds resort to nesting on adjacent farmland after major flood events. In the North Island, the most well-known colony is at Sulphur Bay, Lake Rotorua. Elsewhere in the North Island, black-billed gulls nest at a range of sites including inland rivers, coastal shell banks, sandspits, and even locations such as lake-side marinas, hydroelectric dams and busy ports. After the breeding season, most South Island birds migrate to the coast, though movement patterns are poorly known.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Estimated at 90,000 mature individuals in 2008; approximately 70% in Southland, 5% in the North Island, and the remainder in Otago, Canterbury, Marlborough and, to a lesser extent, the West Coast. Black-billed gull colonies often exceed 1,000 nests in Southland and sometimes Canterbury, but are generally smaller elsewhere. Surveys of Southland&#x2019;s main rivers began in 1974, and analysis revealed a population decline in excess of 80% in 30 years. The decline was greatest on the Oreti River, Southland (97% in 33 years), which once supported the largest colonies recorded in New Zealand. Black-billed gulls have expanded north in the&#xA0;North Island&#xA0;in recent years (now breeding in the Kaipara Harbour), but there is no evidence for an overall increase in the North Island population. Reports and publications soon to be completed include an analysis of 50 years of South Island-wide black-billed gull data, and the results of a nationwide survey of black-billed gulls during the 2016-2017 breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Black-billed gulls are affected by a wide variety of threats. Introduced predators such as cats, stoats, and ferrets take eggs, chicks and adults, and native swamp harriers and southern black-backed gulls take eggs and chicks. In Southland rivers, colonies nesting on islands have better nesting success than colonies nesting on banks, presumably because predatory mammals cannot reach them as easily. Southern black-backed gulls can cause abandonment of smaller colonies through harassment and predation. Weed encroachment on riverbeds has removed suitable breeding habitat on some rivers, and can force birds to nest closer to the water&#x2019;s edge, making nests more vulnerable to flooding. Black-billed gulls may be susceptible to changes in agricultural practices, such as intensification of farming and extensive use of herbicides and pesticides. Thousands of gulls may have died in Southland during extreme droughts in the 1970s and the heavy snowfall of 1996, apparently due to pasture invertebrates becoming inaccessible for extended periods. Human impacts at breeding colonies can also be significant. In recent years, vehicles have been driven through a number of colonies, killing eggs, chicks, and even adults, and large numbers of adults have been shot. During the non-breeding season, the population may be affected by changes in the availability of marine food sources caused by oceanic warming, particularly off the Kaikoura coast. The conservation status of this species was changed from Nationally Endangered to Nationally Critical in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Colonies are established in August-September, and are abandoned at the end of the breeding season in December to February, or occasionally earlier in response to floods, and predator or human disturbance. Mean nest density in Southland colonies is 1.2 nests/m2, and can reach 4-5 nests/m2 in dense colonies. Pairs mostly lay two eggs, though clutches of four or even five have been observed. Eggs are incubated for 20-24 days, and chicks fledge at approximately 26 days.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Black-billed gulls nest in noisy, dense colonies, mainly on riverbeds. They almost never nest as isolated pairs. Colony locations often change from year to year, and rivers in Southland can have 1,000 nests in one year, and 10,000 the following year. During the breeding season, birds feed at the river&#x2019;s edge, or take insects on the wing over the river, but they are much more likely to be observed following ploughs on farms adjacent to the river, sometimes flying tens of kilometres for food. On rare occasions, black-billed gulls can be seen hawking for insects over tussock grassland or beech forest. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the breeding season, black-billed gulls feed primarily on invertebrates taken from rivers and adjacent pasture. In Southland,&#xA0;most birds forage on pasture invertebrates. Black-billed gulls also feed on fish such as whitebait. During winter, birds continue to use agricultural habitats, but also feed in the coastal marine zone on fish and marine invertebrates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-billed_Gull\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-billed_Gull</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Higgins, P.J.; Davies, S.J.J.F.

They disperse widely in the non-breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>An abundant species in tropical waters but only about 25 pairs nest in New Zealand - all on Curtis Island in the Kermadec Islands. This may be a newly established colony.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>At the Kermadec Islands, brown noddies nest as isolated pairs, but elsewhere large colonies can occur. At Curtis Island in October-November 1989, most nests contained eggs, although a few chicks were present from October. This indicated that the laying period there includes September to November and that the fledging period includes December to January (based on data from Higgins &amp; Davies 1996).</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>At the Kermadec Islands brown noddies are gregarious at sea. Their flight is direct and low to the water, with nesting pairs making conspicuous flights together. Little behavioural and ecological information has been recorded for the New Zealand population.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Off Curtis Island, brown noddies swirled over fish schools catching small fish by surface dipping and skimming the sea surface, often in mixed flocks with black noddies.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Noddy\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Noddy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3294\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3294</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gill, B.J.; Driessen, J. 1993.

Adult birds are sooty black with a white cap, the reverse of most terns, which are typically pale with a black cap. Black noddies are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical seas, other than Western Australia and the Indian Ocean, where it is replaced by the lesser noddy (<em>A. tenuirostris</em>). About 2,200 pairs breed in New Zealand at the Kermadec Islands. Stragglers rarely reach northern waters of the North Island, from the Three Kings Islands to Northland and Waikato. Black noddies are graceful and buoyant in flight. They have a long, slender, black bill that is about a third longer than the head.</p>\n<p>The name noddy is derived from animated courting displays in which both birds repeatedly nod at one another.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>The black noddy is a medium-sized sooty black tern with contrasting white head cap that grades into grey on the neck. It has a slender, sharply-pointed black bill, a white crescent below the dark round eye, and a white spot above it. The wings are long and pointed (66 - 72 cm wingspan), and the tail wedge-shaped. The short legs are red-brown to yellow-brown with dull orange or dull pink webbing. The sexes are alike. Juveniles have greyish feathers on the upper wings.</p>\n<p>Voice: rapid harsh rattling calls and sharp <em>kerr</em> or <em>kik-kirrik</em>. Chicks beg with hissing <em>see-ew</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the brown noddy is larger, heavier and browner, with a greyish-white cap, a shorter, stouter bill and pale central panels on the underwings.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The black noddy breeds in colonies on tropical and subtropical islands in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and the Caribbean Sea. It breeds on sea cliffs, in caves, in trees and on shrubby vegetation, and on the ground, on both low-lying sandy atolls and high rocky islands. Outside the breeding season black noddies usually remain near nesting islands, but occasionally cross open sea to other islands. They forage in flocks over coral lagoons, coastal waters, and up to 80 km offshore. In New Zealand, black noddies breed at the Kermadec Islands on North and South Meyer Islets off Raoul Island, on L&apos;Esperance Rock, and on Macauley, Curtis and Cheeseman Islands. Their non-breeding movements are poorly known, apparently being resident at some islands, and a seasonal visitor to others. Some Fiji breeders disperse west through the Solomon Islands. Black noddies rarely stray to mainland New Zealand waters, where there are about a dozen records from northern waters off the Three Kings Islands and Northland, and south to Farewell Spit.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of black noddies is estimated at 200,000 pairs, with 2,200 pairs breeding in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Introduced rats and feral cats extirpated black noddies on Raoul Island, and were in turn eradicated by the Department of Conservation in 2002. The global population appears to be stable with an expanding breeding range and population on islands of the Great Barrier Reef. Many other populations are declining or have been eradicated due to human hunting and habitat loss. Birds are harvested as food in Micronesia and Tokelau, and vegetation clearance has destroyed nesting habitat on other islands. Most populations on the Hawaiian Islands are protected and monitored; elsewhere in the region there have been few efforts to protect seabirds. Where laws exist that restrict or prohibit hunting or egg collection, enforcement is challenging or inadequate. The IUCN Red List classifies the black noddy as Least Concern. The Department of Conservation classifies it as naturally uncommon, range restricted, and secure overseas.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Black noddies are colonial breeders, with breeding dates varying between years at the Kermadec Islands. Courtship includes paired flights, mutual head nodding on the ground, and males courtship-feeding their mates. The single pale, streaked egg is laid August-January, mostly in October-November. The nest is usually a substantial scruffy-looking platform with a shallow depression in the centre, made of sticks, leaves and seaweed, held together with guano, and built in the fork of a pohutukawa tree or in ngaio scrub. Both adults incubate for 30 - 37 days and care for the chick. An adult guards the chick during the first days or weeks after hatching. The chick fledges 48-60 days after hatching, then returns to the nest to be fed by its parents for several weeks. There is a high rate of nest failure, but pairs are able to produce a second egg if they lose the first.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black noddies forage during the day in small to large flocks of 20-3000 birds. They fly low over the water, hovering, dipping and pattering their feet on the surface, seizing prey while remaining airborne, or dipping the bill into water, usually without submerging. They are dependent on predatory fish, such as tuna, to drive prey species to the surface. Black noddies also pirate food from other seabirds. Foraging occurs by day and probably also at night, with peaks of activity at the colony in the early morning and evening. Black noddies roost at colonies during the middle of the day and during the night.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black noddies feed on small fish and squid caught at the surface, and pirate food from other seabirds. They have been recorded eating caterpillars and juvenile sea snakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Noddy\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Noddy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3295\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3295</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J.

The upperwings are slightly darker than the rest of the body, with greyer or brown tinged coverts, and blackish outer flight feathers. The short tail has a shallow fork. Most birds have a thin white partial eye-ring around the back half of the eye. The black bill is slender and sharply pointed, with bright orange at the gape. The long black legs and large feet are black with pale pink webs. The sexes are alike. Juveniles are similar to adults with brownish upperparts and crown.

In New Zealand, they breed on all&#xA0;of the Kermadec Islands, with 15,000 pairs estimated on Macauley and Curtis Islands. They may have bred occasionally on islands off northern New Zealand (e.g. Volkner Rocks off White Island, Sugarloaf Rock in the Alderman Islands, Maori Rocks (Cathedral Rocks) in the Mokohinau Islands, Sugarloaf Rock in the Poor Knights Islands, and West Island in the Three Kings Islands), but these sites are mainly used as post-breeding roosting sites, when warm sea temperatures in late summer provide suitable conditions for grey noddies to move south. They breed and roost mainly on cliffs or, less often, in areas of sheltered rocky ground, on beaches, or in bushy vegetation. Grey noddies feed in flocks over lagoons and inshore waters, often over upwelling currents.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total global population of grey noddies is estimated to be 27,000-120,000 birds. The New Zealand population is c. 17,000 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Introduced mammalian predators have been eradicated from the Kermadec Islands and are also absent from potential breeding sites in northern New Zealand. The IUCN Red List classifies the grey noddy&#xA0;as Least Concern. The Department of Conservation classifies it as naturally uncommon, range restricted and secure overseas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The grey noddy is a widespread annual breeder on tropical and subtropical islands of Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia, all in the Pacific Ocean. The timing of breeding varies with location, but is August-February on the Kermadec Islands. Courtship display includes pairs hovering in the wind and weaving across each other&apos;s flight path. During incubation, the unoccupied bird sometimes displays in front of its incubating mate by hovering in with its wings and tail raised at a c.45&#xB0; angle, and making a series of U-shaped dipping flights. The single pale, freckled egg is laid August-December. Grey noddy nests are placed on cliff ledges and cliff-tops up to 600 m above sea level, and on bare rocky ground and rocky beaches out of the sun. Nests are made from grass and seaweed. Both adults share incubation of 32 days, and the chick is brooded continuously for the first 2-3 weeks. Chicks fledge after 35-37 days, and both adults continue feeding the juvenile by regurgitation for some time after fledging. Chicks peck at pink webs on adult birds&apos; feet for food, rather than at bill as is usual with other terns.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey noddies are gregarious, breeding in loose colonies, and mainly staying within 20 km of breeding sites. Some birds disperse after breeding, including those that visit the outer Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Plenty. They usually forage in small flocks close to shore, but large flocks of over 5,000 birds sometimes form. Flocks often include a few black noddies. Grey noddies fly low over the water using quick, shallow wing-beats, dipping to catch prey at the surface. They often hover close to the water, pattering their feet on the surface like a storm-petrel, while searching for prey. They may also sit on the sea surface and paddle. When disturbed, birds resting on cliff ledges fly up and scream noisily before settling back on the ledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Grey noddies feed on krill, tiny fish, squid and sea-striders. They have the narrowest gape of all terns and take the smallest fish (average size just 17 mm).</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Noddy\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Noddy</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J.

They breed on tree-covered tropical and subtropical islands, and forage over lagoons, close to atolls and islands, and at sea. The white tern is one of the rarest breeding species in New Zealand, where they nest only on Raoul Island in the Kermadec Islands. Up to ten pairs nest in trees along the south-east coast from Boat Cove to Sunshine Valley.</p>\n<p>White terns are resident year-round on some islands, and are seasonal (breeding) visitors to others; their non-breeding movements remain unknown. They straggle rarely to waters off the Three Kings Islands, the Northland coast, and the Manawatu-Kapiti coast, with most sightings during March-July. There are about a dozen records from the North Island and three from the South Island: Hokitika (undated), Ettrick, Otago (March 1945), and Greymouth (January 2002).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand population of white terns is c.10 pairs, with the global population numbering in the hundreds of thousands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Introduced feral cats and rats killed breeding birds and took eggs on Raoul Island up until they were eradicated on the island in 2002. IUCN Red List classifies it as Least Concern. The Department of Conservation classifies it as Nationally Critical, breeding&#xA0;at one location only&#xA0;in New Zealand, but&#xA0;secure overseas.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>White terns breed as single pairs or in small colonies of 2 - 3 pairs at Raoul Island, nesting in the same tree on different branches, up to 15 m above ground. Up to 20 birds have been seen flying at Raoul Island and up to ten pairs recorded breeding. On Raoul Island, the breeding season is September to April. Courtship involves elaborate aerial displays in which the male flies up to 500 m high at speed, followed by the female. The pair then glides and zigzags downwards before &quot;strutting&quot; together on the ground with tails raised and wings dropped. Pairs also appear to whisper to each other, hence the name, lover tern. White terns are monogamous. The single pale egg with dark and grey markings is laid October-December on a slight depression of a bare branch or fork, up to 15 m off the ground. Both adults share incubation of 28-36 days and care for the young. The chick grips the branch tightly with its claws, and remains on the branch until fledging at 60 -75 days old. After fledging, young birds stay with parents to be fed and learn how to catch prey before becoming independent.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>White terns are not sociable. Birds forage singly or in pairs over lagoons, close to atolls and islands, and at sea. Nest sites are aggressively defended from other white terns, with intruders repelled by bill grappling and jabbing. The oldest white tern recorded was 17 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>White terns catch and eat fish, including flying fish, crustaceans and squid. Prey are caught by the tern hovering into the wind and surface-dipping or surface-diving (without fully submerging). White terns also take flying fish on the wing and forage around dolphins and large predatory fish. The types of prey species taken, and the tern&#x2019;s large eye suggest that dawn and dusk foraging are important.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3298\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3298</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J.

It is slender and handsome, with strong contrast between dark brown-grey/black plumage above and white below. They are highly gregarious and noisy at breeding sites, but outside the breeding season they are pelagic and rarely seen near land. Their oceanic travels are not well known, but band recoveries have revealed birds moving thousands of kilometres. Colonies are restricted to small, mostly predator-free islands and can be huge (more than 1,000,000 birds). In the New Zealand region the sooty tern occurs in what are now relatively small colonies in the Kermadec Islands, and it is a rare visitor to the mainland.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The sooty tern is a striking, medium-sized black-and-white tern. It is long and streamlined, with long wings and strongly contrasting plumage, dark above and white below. The upperparts are fully dark, except for a white leading edge to the inner wing. The underparts are white (greyer towards tail) except for the darker wingtips, trailing edge to the inner wing and outer tail. Tail is markedly forked with long outer tail feathers forming streamers. The white forehead patch terminates just above the eye. The slender black bill is slightly shorter than the head; the eyes and feet are dark. Juveniles have very different plumage, being mainly dark brown above with prominent white or buff bars formed by pale edges to the feathers. The throat and breast are also dark, grading into a paler belly and undertail, and the underwings are pale grey. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice: sharp, loud <em>wideawake</em> or <em>kek, kek, kek</em> call, usually heard at colonies and roosting sites. Colonies are incessantly noisy.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the bridled tern, which is much smaller, has white extending just beyond the eye, and is paler dorsally, appearing dark grey rather than blackish. It is more likely to be seen in coastal environments where sooty terns do not normally occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty terns are present in all tropical oceans, and some sub-tropical regions. Outside the breeding season they stay well offshore and are rarely seen. Sooty terns breed on small islands including atolls, sandbanks, rock stacks and offshore islands, but generally forages offshore even when breeding. The only New Zelaand breeding sites are on the Kermadec Islands, where there are small colonies on most islands in the group. Other nearby colonies are found on Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands. At least some birds travel long distances. A bird ringed on Raoul Island (Kermadec Islands) in the 1960s was breeding on Aride Island (Seychelles) in the 1990s; over 14,240 km by the shortest sea route.</p>\n<p><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand population estimates are difficult due to inaccessibility of colonies.Kermadec Islands colonies were recorded as: 5,000 pairs on Raoul (1994); 10,000 on Herald Islets; 10,000 on Macauley/Hazard; 10,000 on Curtis 10,000 (1989); 5,000 on Cheeseman (1970). The two Raoul Island colonies numbered 40,000 each in 1967, but by 2000 one colony was gone completely and the other was only a remnant. With the eradication of pests on Raoul (rats in 2002, cats in 2004) the remaining colony seems to be increasing towards 10,000 birds. Original numbers on the Kermadec Islands are unknown, but Lord Howe colonies comprised up to a million breeding pairs in the 1970s.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Human harvesting, especially egg collection has impacted many colonies worldwide and numerous former colonies have disappeared. However, some protected colonies have demonstrated rapid regeneration. On Raoul Island human harvesting ceased by the 1930s, but cats and rats were a problem until eradicated in 2002-04.</p>\n<p>Changes in food supply may be a threat, especially near colonies at breeding time. Climatic and human induced changes in fish populations and locations are potential threats. Sooty terns feed on baitfish chased by tuna, but the impact of changes in tuna stocks on foraging success is unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Sooty terns start arriving at Kermadec Islands colonies in August/September, initially at night in low numbers, but increasing rapidly before laying of the single egg in October-November. Females can relay once or twice if the egg is lost. Laying is synchronised within colonies. Both adults incubate, and they&#xA0;will stand over the egg to provide shade on hot days. Both parents feed the chick, usually, but not exclusively at night. Young fly after 4 weeks and leave the colony after 8 weeks. Kermadec colonies aredeserted by the end May.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty terns breed monogamously in dense, noisy colonies, which may vary in size from year to year. They forage within 300-500 km of the colony. Fledglings spend several years at sea without returning to land. Sooty tern behaviour is poorly known, and the whereabouts of Kermadec birds in the non-breeding season is unknown. They are long-lived, with some birds recovered more than 30 years after banding.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Sooty tern diet varies with location and availability, and is comprised of fish, crustaceans, and squid, taken at sea, during both daylight and at night.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3288\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3288</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gaskin, C.P. 2011.

As with the related (similarly dark) bridled and sooty terns, the grey-backed tern is a highly pelagic species, generally staying at sea outside the breeding season. It is most common in the tropical Pacific, but the extent of its range is not well known. There are two accepted sightings from New Zealand, from the Kaipara Harbour and Taranaki.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The grey-backed tern is a medium-sized tern, predominantly dark above and white below. As its name suggests, it has a grey back, but the wings are brownish-grey. In breeding plumage the black cap is markedly darker than the back and wings, and is separated from the bill by a white stripe that passes over the eye, ending level with the back of the eye. A black stripe runs from the base of the upper mandible through the eye to join with the lower edge of the cap. In adult non-breeding plumage, the black cap and dark stripe through the eye are faded and/or streaked with white.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the grey-backed tern is most similar to the bridled tern, differing mainly in the paler back contrasting markedly with the darker upperwings. The sooty tern differs from both grey-backed tern and bridled tern in being larger, darker dorsally, and having the white on the forehead end in front of (not behind) the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Grey-backed terns are known primarily from the tropics of the Pacific, breeding from Hawaii in the north (especially the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands) to the tropical islands of the central Pacific, and south as far as Fiji and French Polynesia. The full extent of its range is not well known, but it has been recorded west to Papua New Guinea and the Philippines and east to Easter Island.

The eggs and sometimes even the adults were formerly gathered by sailors to replenish their stocks of fresh food. The scientific name, <em>anaethetus</em>, meaning senseless or stupid, bestowed during this time, was based on the ease with which they were able to do this.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Bridled terns are elegant, medium-sized tropical terns, with long slender wings and a long, deeply forked tail. They are smaller than a white-fronted tern and only a little larger than a black-fronted tern. They are sooty brown above and white below, with black on the crown with a white forehead and eyebrow. They are very similar to the sooty tern which is also a rare vagrant to mainland New Zealand but much more likely to be found here. Immature birds are broadly similar to the adults, but the back is greyer and has a scaly pattern formed by pale feather edges. The face pattern is less distinct with the brown cap streaked with white and the white markings sometimes smudgy, the diagnostic white stripe above and extending behind the eye remains. The white under surface from chin to vent is different from immature sooty terns which have an all-dark face and breast with white only on the belly. Some immature bridled terns have the chin darker but still obviously paler than the rest of the head.</p>\n<p>Voice: bridled terns are generally silent at sea. They may be noisy at breeding colonies and roosts, uttering a variety of short harsh calls and also a yapping call reminiscent of a small dog or a pied stilt.</p>\n<p>Similar species: in breeding plumage an adult bridled tern may be distinguished from a sooty tern by its smaller size and the colour of the upper surface, especially the back, being greyish brown (cf. blackish brown for sooty tern). More important are the details of the head pattern with a black crown, less of a white forehead and a white stripe running back over the eye and finishing just behind the eye instead of at the front of it. A dark stripe through the eye finishes at the base of the upper mandible rather than the gape as in sooty terns. In all plumages the under wing pattern is distinctive with the bases of the primaries white rather than dark as in the sooty tern so that the wing tips are white edged with black. The legs and feet are dark grey and the eye is black. In nonbreeding plumage the adults look very similar, having a paler and less striking crown and eye stripe with some pale flecking. Many of the brown feathers on the back and upper wings have fine white or light brown edges and the tail is shorter and not so deeply forked. The grey-backed tern (another very rare vagrant to New Zealand) is very similar to the bridled tern, differing in having a paler grey back, contrasting with the darker upperwings.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Bridled terns breed widely in Western Australia, across the north and along the Queensland coast but are very rarely found in the south and south east. Their range has slowly extended southwards since about 1940. In the Pacific they breed to the west of a line from the Philippines, through Palau to Samoa andTonga but not further east. Birds from the southernmost colonies are migratory, probably moving north after breeding, with band recoveries suggesting that birds breeding in Western Australia winter near the equator in Indonesian waters.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>One beach cast specimen found on New Brighton Beach in November 1987.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Bridled terns usually nest in noisy colonies, often associated with other tern species. The breeding season begins in spring, birds usually arriving at the colonies from August to November and departing after a successful season in April or early May. In the non-breeding season they are usually found alone, offshore, often far from land and, characteristically, may roost on floating objects from coconuts to fishing boats. They are pelagic feeders in tropical waters found particularly where seaweed and flotsam gather such as current convergences.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Bridled terns feed mainly in the open sea, taking small schooling fish up to 6 cm long, with some squid and crustaceans. Prey items are caught from the surface or top 20 cm of the water, by dipping or dives in which the body is seldom fully submerged.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridled_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridled_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3287\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3287</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

They are very similar to the now rare fairy tern, especially in the nondescript non-breeding and immature plumages most often seen in New Zealand. Even museum specimens were misidentified and over-looked. Careful observations by Ross McKenzie and Dick Sibson led to the presence of little terns being confirmed on the Miranda coast, Firth of Thames in the 1950s. By this time, the fairy tern had become one of New Zealand&#x2019;s rarest birds, and the little tern is now known to be the commonest small tern in the country over the summer. Further observations have shown that birds seen in New Zealand come from two different populations; most of them are northern hemisphere migrants that spend their non-breeding season in New Zealand but a few are from the population breeding in Australia and they can be recognised by having a moult cycle that is six months different.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Little terns are very small, slender terns with a short tail that has a shallow fork. They are pale birds, light grey on the back and upper wings and white on the rump, tail and underparts. The black cap is separated from the bill by an extensive white forehead. Little terns&#xA0;may be&#xA0;distinctive in flight, frequently stopping to hover when they are feeding.</p>\n<p>In New Zealand most birds are in non-breeding or immature plumage, with black bills, and white extending from the forehead to the crown. The crown&#xA0;is white variably mottled with black, and a band of black across the rear of the crown reaches to just in front of the eyes. A blackish leading edge to the wing shows as dark shoulder stripe and 2-3 dark primaries when they are at rest. The legs are brownish.&#xA0;In breeding plumage the bill of adults becomes clear yellow with a black tip, and the whitish crown becomes black&#xA0;with stripes extending through the eye to the sides of the bill. The forehead is broadly white, with sharp-ended white wedges reaching back over the eye (cf. fairy tern). The outer feathers of the tail lengthen to reach almost as far as the wing tips. Most little terns in New Zealand are Northern Hemisphere migrants acquiring breeding plumage&#xA0;from February onward.</p>\n<p>Voice: the common flight call made by little terns is a sharp &#x201C;kik&#x201D; repeated several times. This is sharper than the similar call made by fairy terns. A rapid chatter &#x201C;chit-chit-chit&#x201D; may also be given when feeding.</p>\n<p>Similar species: fairy terns are very similar to little terns and care is needed to separate them. In all plumages fairy terns are more robust and deep-bellied, with short legs and a bill that is slightly deeper at the base and straight along the top edge. In contrast little terns are slim, longer legged and the bill has a slight curve along the top edge. In fairy tern breeding plumage, the black spot in front of the eye stops well short of the base of the bill. There is a short blunt-ended white stripe over the eye. The yellow bill has a distinctly orange tone and lacks a black tip. In non-breeding plumage, fairy terns develop a black tip to their bills which also become stained to some degree with brown and there is at least a little white flecking in their crowns at this time.</p>\n<p>Juvenile fairy terns are very similar to little terns in immature or non-breeding plumage. Apart from differences in shape (see above) the black patch in front of the eye is short but very deep, particularly extending below the level of the eye. Juvenile fairy terns have a dark brownish bill that is never quite black but the bills of little terns become lighter as they enter breeding plumage and may be similar at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Little terns are widespread in Europe, Africa and Asia, with the eastern subspecies, <em>S. a. sinensis</em>, breeding widely from India to Japan to northern and eastern Australia. Birds from Asian populations are trans-equatorial migrants,&#xA0;arriving in New Zealand during October and departing in March, with some younger birds leaving later (sometimes as late as May). Australian birds are short distance migrants or disperse locally within Australia. The few that reach New Zealand arrive from April with adults known to depart in October or November. There have been band recoveries in New Zealand of birds marked in Japan and Australia.</p>\n<p>In New Zealand, little terns inhabit sheltered coastal waters, and may occur in estuaries and harbours right around the New Zealand coast. Particularly favoured localities are Manukau, Kaipara and Rangaunu Harbours, where small flocks may occur. &#xA0;There is a single record from each of Chatham Island (December 1997 to January 1998) and Macauley Island, Kermadec Islands (November 1980).</p>\n<p><strong>Population &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Possibly up to 100 little terns may occur in New Zealand each year but occasionally larger numbers occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Little terns breeding in Australia are regarded as vulnerable as the population breeding in the south-east is small and has declined due to human disturbance, predation and natural catastrophes. The number of Asian-breeding birds migrating to Australia appears to be stable, and so these populations may not be threatened at present.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Little terns are colonial breeders in coastal habitats. The nest is a shallow scrape that holds up to three eggs. The parents are monogamous and share the incubation and chick rearing duties.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Little terns in direct flight fly fast with steady beats of bent wings. When feeding, little terns pause in their patrols to hover on rapidly beating wings while looking down. From this position they may dive, often in very shallow water and the body rarely becomes fully submerged. Little terns often roost with small waders, especially wrybills. If several little terns are present they may roost and feed together as a flock.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Small fish form the bulk of the diet but crustaceans, insects and worms have also been recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3276\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3276</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The relict population of fewer than a dozen pairs survives between Whangarei in the north and Auckland to the south. The tiny population is gravely threatened by introduced predators and disturbance&#xA0;or encroachment by humans. They are intensively managed during the breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The fairy tern is a small tern with pale grey upperparts and white underparts, with the rump and forked tail also white. The wings have&#xA0;a dark grey outer web on the outer primary. Breeding adults have a completely yellow-orange bill, and a black cap covering the crown and nape. The cap extends forward to surround the eye, forming an irregular patch in front of it, but never reaching the bill. A rounded white &#x2018;notch&#x2019; projects into the black cap above the eye, and is contiguous with the white forehead. The legs are bright orange. In late summer, black appears on the base of the bill, nostrils then tip, whilst the black cap recedes, leaving the forecrown mottled. The black feathering forward of the eye reduces in extent, and the legs and bill become duller. Breeding plumage is regained from June onwards. The sexes are alike. Immature birds are similar to non-breeding adults. First winter birds have a pale grey crown and a black band from eye to eye around the back of the head. Their bills are&#xA0;brown-black initially, with yellow-orange emerging before their first summer. The leading edge of the wing is dark, visible in flight and as a &#x2018;carpal bar&#x2019; when the wings are folded. The legs are brown. This first winter plumage is easily confused with non-breeding little tern because, in addition to the above,&#xA0;first-year fairy terns have dark webs on several outer primaries, a feature shared with little tern.</p>\n<p>Voice: high-pitched calls, often repeated, which render as &#x2018;<em>tiet, tiet</em>&#x2019; or &#x2018;<em>kek, kek</em>&#x2019;. An alarm call, &#x2018;<em>zipt-zipt-zipt</em>&#x2019; accompanies dive-bombing and defecation when nests or chicks are threatened.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the fairy tern is very similar to the migratory little tern. Compared to little terns, fairy terns are stouter, with sturdier, relatively shorter legs and a more conical bill. The white &#x2019;notch&#x2019; above the eye in little tern breeding plumage is acutely angled, not rounded. Only in little tern breeding plumage does the black in front of the eye taper to the base of the chrome-yellow, black-tipped bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy terns are confined to Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia, with endemic subspecies in each country. Fairy terns breed successfully at four sites only in New Zealand: Waipu sandspit, Mangawhai sandspit, Pakiri River mouth (one pair since 2003), and Papakanui sandspit on the southern headland of the Kaipara Harbour. Since 2012, birds have occasionally nested at the Te Arai Stream mouth, just south of Mangawhai. They nest on exposed sand spits, clear of vegetation and large debris, and where shell accumulates above spring high water. Birds forage in adjacent estuaries or a short distance out to sea.&#xA0;Immediately post-breeding, east coast birds are known to forage over Slipper and Spectacle Lakes and regularly roost at Te Arai Stream-mouth, just south of Mangawhai. Birds of all ages frequent sheltered estuaries and harbours between Whangarei and Auckland, but mainly&#xA0;the Kaipara Harbour, where autumn and winter flocks can number 20-30 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are currently&#xA0;c.40 fairy terns in New Zealand, with&#xA0;fewer than a dozen breeding pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy terns were once widespread around the North Island coast and at river mouths in the South Island. Some historical records are doubtful, as little terns were not recognised in New Zealand until the 1950s. Fairy tern range contracted during the 19th and 20th centuries due to predators, modification of coastal habitats and human disturbance during breeding. These factors continue to threaten the population. Conservation effort at breeding sites concentrates on predator control (including gulls and harriers), cordoning off nests to&#xA0;exclude human and vehicle&#xA0;disturbance, and minimising coastal development impacts. As an example of such impacts, since 2015 some areas of mangroves have been removed from the Mangawhai Harbour and the size of the first clutches of most mature breeding females at that breeding site has reduced.</p>\n<p>Breeding success is also&#xA0;frequently affected by environmental factors. High tides, especially if&#xA0;backed by onshore wind, can inundate nests. Adverse weather can diminish foraging ability, causing desertion of eggs or death of chicks. Mobile sand can cover nests.&#xA0; When necessary, nests are intensively managed by gradual repositioning,&#xA0;by elevation or by sandbagging, to protect them from rapid sand movement,&#xA0;spring tides&#xA0;or storm surges. Pro-active enhancement of nest sites by removing vegetation and/or adding appropriately coloured shell, is increasingly undertaken prior to the breeding season, to encourage nesting in the safest possible locations. A project is underway to restore an historical nesting site within the Kaipara Harbour using these techniques, as well as recorded calls and decoy models. Some eggs are cross-fostered between pairs (via artificial incubation at Auckland Zoo) as an intervention for vulnerable nests.&#xA0;Public awareness and education is ongoing, especially&#xA0;in communities adjacent to fairy tern nesting areas. All breeding sites are increasingly popular recreational destinations,&#xA0;with recreational activities (e.g. kite-surfing) reducing the area of undisturbed coastal waters available for fairy tern&#xA0;foraging. Pre-fledged chicks are individually colour banded to facilitate&#xA0;monitoring and management. Supplementary feeding assisted with the full fledging of two chicks in 2014, following the loss of their male parent just before fledging.</p>\n<p>The level of genetic variation within the population is currently being investigated.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy terns have a high degree of fidelity to mates, nest sites and foraging areas. Courtship begins in September, and egg-laying occurs from late October until early January. Females will relay if clutches or young chicks are lost early in the season. The female is supplementary-fed by the male before laying. The 1-2 well-camouflaged eggs are placed in an unlined scrape&#xA0;well away from vegetation or flotsam. Nest sites are in areas with predominantly white, grey and orange shells&#xA0;on sand, thereby aiding concealment of eggs, chicks and incubating adults. Nests are often at least 1 km apart, in areas with predominantly white, grey and orange shells on sand, thereby aiding concealment of eggs, chicks and incubating adults.&#xA0;Intraspecific aggression reduces fledging success when pairs&#xA0;nest in close proximity (e.g. 10 m apart). Females tend to take longer incubation shifts than males. The chicks are mobile from day one and seek shelter from the elements. Whenf&#xA0;parents utter&#xA0;alarm calls, chicks freeze <em>in situ</em>, blending into the beach. Both parents guard and feed the young, with the male providing the most food. Chicks fully fledge at about 30 days, and are fed with reducing frequency by their parents for another month while they learn to forage for themselves. By this time, most family groups have&#xA0;vacated their&#xA0;breeding estuaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy terns forage by hovering 5-15 m above the water surface, before diving for prey, but&#xA0;not totally immersing their body. In estuaries, they usually search against the current.</p>\n<p>Fairy terns&#x2019; high tide roost sites are open areas of mud, sand, shell or sparsely vegetated salt marsh,&#xA0;which are also used by other roosting shorebirds. Tidal heights determine site usage. Roosts are abandoned or adopted in response to natural or human-induced changes, including vegetation encroachment and disturbance.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Fairy terns catch juvenile flounder, gobies, elvers and other small coastal or estuarine fish and shrimps. A regurgitated pellet retrieved at a Kaipara roost contained juvenile kahawai ear bones (Tom Trnski pers. comm.).</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.omahashorebirds.co.nz/\">www.omahashorebirds.co.nz</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Fairy_Tern\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Fairy_Tern</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/nz-fairy-tern-tara-iti/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/sea-and-shore-birds/nz-fairy-tern-tara-iti/</a></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.endangeredspecies.org.nz/\">www.endangeredspecies.org.nz</a></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

A recent DNA study revealed that piopio are orioles &#x2013; a group of songbirds that are typically bright yellow-and-black elsewhere, but more sombre olive and brown in Australasia.

Unconfirmed sightings continued into the 1970s, mainly from forest behind Whanganui, inland Taranaki and Te Urewera.

A long purring <em>chur-r-r </em>was given as a threat to intruders at the nest.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the introduced song thrush is about half the size of a piopio, and is paler underneath (more spotted than streaked) with a finer bill.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The South Island piopio occurred throughout the South Island, on some Fiordland islands and on Stephens Island in Cook Strait. It was abundant throughout, but had become scarce in drier eastern districts by the time of European settlement. They remained abundant in podocarp-dominant forest and &quot;<em>fruit-bearing scrubs</em>&quot; from sea-level to the alpine zone on the West Coast through to the 1880s. South Island piopio were observed foraging around some early European campsites and huts.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The South Island piopio declined rapidly following European settlement, especially after 1870. It was extinct on Banks and Otago Peninsulas by the 1880s. It was still relatively common on the West Coast and Fiordland in the 1880s, but was extinct there by c.1895. This decline coincided with the spread of introduced ship rats, and their final disappearance occurred about the time that stoats reached the West Coast and Fiordland. The Stephens Island subspecies was abundant in 1895 but extinct by 1897 following clearance of the island&#x2019;s forest and introduction of cats by lighthouse keepers. Unconfirmed South Island sightings persisted into the 1930s, with the last in west Otago in 1963. Suggestions to transfer South Island piopio to an offshore sanctuary such as Kapiti Island or Little Barrier Island never eventuated, as live capture of free-flying forest birds was very difficult before the invention of modern mist nets.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Little information available. South Island piopio were apparently monogamous, with laying occurring (at least) in late December. The cup-shaped nest of small dry twigs with bark and moss, lined with grass or tree-fern, was placed 1.2 - 4.6 m from the ground in a fork of a small upright branch, among thick foliage. Nest dimensions were c.18 cm external diameter and 13 - 30 cm external depth, with 7.6 cm internal diameter and 5.1 cm internal depth. The 1-2 white or pinkish-white glossy eggs with dark brown-black blotches were incubated by the female at least; the male&#x2019;s parental roles are unknown, but both adults defended the young.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>South Island piopio were territorial and usually seen in pairs. They were described as tame, bold, and unafraid of humans. Two records describe 12 and 20 birds foraging around campsites, including eating from the hand. A bird approaching to investigate an unusual sound kept its tail spread, moving sidewards along a branch, turning its body right and left, and examining the observer closely. They were also observed spreading their tail and lowering their wings while singing. South Island piopio scratched around on the ground among forest litter and moss, using their feet and bill to search for insects, fruits, seeds and leaves, and foraged in glades on river beds during the hottest months. Their song was mainly heard in the early morning and early evening, usually continuing after the dawn chorus. Flights were short, swooping and powerful.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>South Island piopio had an omnivorous diet that included insects, spiders, worms, forest fruits, seeds, leaves, mosses and grasses. They were described making fly-catching sallies from tree-tops. A captive bird ate other birds&apos; eggs, and cooked potato and meat.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Piopio\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_Piopio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=5682\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=5682</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Buller, W.L. 1888.<em> A history of the birds of New Zealand</em>.

It vies with rifleman for the title of New Zealand&#x2019;s smallest bird, with both weighing about 6 g. The title usually goes to rifleman, based on its shorter tail and therefore shorter body length.</p>\n<p>The grey warbler is more often heard than seen, having a loud distinctive song, and tending to spend most of its time in dense vegetation. They are closely related to other members of the <em>Gerygone</em> genus, which are found throughout Australasia and South-East Asia, and include the other native warbler, the Chatham Island warbler.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The grey warbler is a tiny, slim grey songbird that usually stays among canopy foliage. It is olive-grey above, with a grey face and off-white underparts. The tail is darker grey, getting darker towards the tip, contrasting with white tips to the tail feathers, showing as a prominent white band in flight. The black bill is finely pointed, the eye is bright red, and the legs are black and very slender. Grey warblers often glean insects from the outside of the canopy while hovering, which no other New Zealand bird does, making them identifiable by behaviour from a long distance.</p>\n<p>Voice: a characteristic long trilled song. The song is&#xA0;louder than expected, given the bird&#x2019;s size. Only males sing, although females do give short chirp calls, usually as a contact call near the male. Nestlings and fledglings have a high pitched begging call. Begging calls are mimicked by their brood parasite, the shining cuckoo, while in the nest and as a dependent fledgling.</p>\n<p>Similar species: silvereyes are slightly larger, greener above, with buff flanks and (in adults) a characteristic white-eye-ring. In flight, silvereyes have a plain dark tail without a white tip.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The grey warbler is ubiquitous, occurring everywhere there are trees or shrubs on the three main islands, and on most offshore islands. It is one of the few native species to have maintained their distribution in almost all habitats following human colonisation, including rural and urban areas. They are typically found only in woody vegetation, in mid to high levels of the canopy, making them difficult to observe. Alpine tussock is one of the few vegetated habitats where you are unlikely to find grey warblers.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Grey warblers are locally abundant in suitable habitats throughout New Zealand. There are no population estimates, but they are not considered to be under any threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Grey warblers breed in spring and summer, typically from August to January, but can be as early as July and as late as February, with some variation by latitude. The nest is a hanging enclosed dome, usually found in the outer branches of the canopy, 2-4 m off the ground. Nests are usually placed in tree species with smaller leaves, such as manuka, kanuka and <em>Coprosma</em> spp. Birds in the north appear to raise one brood only per season, whereas those in the South Island are typically double-brooded. Females lay 3-5 eggs per clutch.</p>\n<p>Grey warblers are the only mainland host for the brood parasitic shining cuckoo. The female shining cuckoo removes a single egg from the clutch, replacing it with her egg. No egg rejection behaviour is shown by the grey warbler. After hatching, the cuckoo chick ejects all grey warbler eggs and/or nestlings from the nest and is raised alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Grey warblers are often seen flying short distances, moving between branches in the canopy. They have a very fast wing beat, almost hovering at times while foraging. They usually associate as pairs, although there may be some distance between them. Contact is maintained with short chip calls. Pairs stay in their territories year round, although they are not defended during the non-breeding season. During the breeding season, the male sings frequently and actively defends his territory.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Grey warblers are entirely insectivorous, feeding mainly on caterpillars, flies, beetles, moths and other small invertebrates. They are typically seen foraging on the bark of trunks and branches of trees, or hovering just outside the canopy while they glean insects from the outer leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Gerygone\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Gerygone</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Anderson, M.G. 2009.

It is rare or absent over most of the main island, but is still present in the southern forests, and there are several healthy populations on islands in the south of the group. It differs from the grey warbler of the mainland in being larger, and having distinct male, female and juvenile plumages. More often heard than seen, its loud warbling call is reminiscent of a grey warbler that hasn&#x2019;t been fully wound-up, with the initial song phrase repeated over and again. Chatham Island warblers glean invertebrates from leaves and crevices in trunks and branches and sometimes on the ground; unlike the grey warbler, they rarely hover.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island warbler is a small pale forest bird with plain olive-brown head and upperparts, and off-white underparts except for pale yellowish flanks and undertail. The larger male has a prominent white forehead, eyebrows, throat and underparts. The smaller female lacks the white forehead and has dull greyish-white underparts and yellowish eyebrow, cheeks and throat. Juveniles are similar to females, except that their upperparts are olive grey and their underparts are yellower. Adults have red eyes, juveniles have brown eyes.</p>\n<p>Voice: male song is a loud trill of 4 notes <em>chi-ch-ch-ch</em> repeated several times over.</p>\n<p>Similar species: juveniles have similar colouration to silvereyes, but lack the white eye-ring and pink-buff flanks of the silvereye.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island warblers are widespread and locally common in forest in the southern half of Chatham Island, especially in the south-west. They are common on Pitt Island, Little Mangere Island and Star Keys; abundant on Rangatira and Mangere; and recorded from The Castle. Historical records show that they used to be in the northern half of Chatham Island into the early 1900s, but have possibly declined because of habitat loss, degradation of the understorey in remaining forests, and predation by cats and rats.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>There are probably around 5000 adult Chatham Island warblers. They can reach very high densities in suitable predator-free habitat: 10.4 pairs/ha in Woolshed Bush on Rangatira, compared with 0.3 pairs/ha in the Tuku Valley in south-west Chatham Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island warblers died out in the northern part of Chatham Island in the early 1900s, but seem to be holding their own in the southern half of Chatham Island. They will have benefitted from the creation of sanctuaries free of grazing and browsing mammals, and where pests are controlled. They are secure on several predator-free islands south of Pitt Strait.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Eggs are laid from September to December. The female collects nest material and constructs the nest. It is an enclosed pendant nest, similar to that of the grey warbler. On main Chatham Island nests are generally in the open on a terminal branch of <em>Dracophyllum</em>, but on &#x2018;petrel-islands&#x2019; they are situated in dense foliage with lateral and basal connections, presumably to protect them from petrels landing at night. Clutch size is 2-4 white eggs with reddish flecking concentrated at the larger end. Incubation and brooding is by the female only, but both parents feed the young, and usually split the brood after they have fledged.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island warblers are not particularly strong fliers, but they do fly purposefully through the canopy or shrub layer when having territorial disputes. Some late nests are parasitised by shining cuckoos. They feed mainly by gleaning insects from leaves and from crevices in trunks and branches rather than hovering as the grey warbler does. They forage at any level from the leaf litter to the canopy at predator-free sites, but mainly in the canopy on Chatham Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island warblers eat mostly small invertebrates, especially spiders, caterpillars, flies, beetles and bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Dennison, M.D.; Robertson, H.A.; Crouchley, D. 1984.

Their song is a welcome sound in mainland forests that otherwise may have little native bird song. Although they have a brush-like tongue which is used to reach deeply into flowers to reach nectar, bellbirds also feed on fruits and insects. In feeding on nectar they play an important ecological role in pollinating the flowers of many native trees and shrubs. Subsequently, when feeding on the fruits that result from this pollination they have a role in dispersing the seeds, and so they assist in the regeneration of the forest in at least two ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Bellbirds are green with a short, curved bill, slightly forked tail, and noisy whirring, fast and direct flight. Adult males are olive green, slightly paler on the underparts, with a head tinted purple; wings and tail blackish. Female are browner with narrow white-yellow stripe across the cheek from the base of the bill, and bluish gloss on top of head. Adults of both sexes have wine-red eyes. Juveniles are similar to females, but with yellowish cheek stripe, brown eyes and lacking the bluish gloss on the head.</p>\n<p>Voice: song varies regionally but is ringing notes without grunts or wheezes. Alarm call a rapidly repeated harsh &#x201C;yeng,&#x201D;. The famous bell notes noted by Sir Joseph Banks in Queen Charlotte Sound on James Cook&#xA0;first voyage to New Zealand are only heard when many birds are present at once, mostly at dawn and dusk in places of high bellbird density with few other bird species.</p>\n<p>Similar species: greenfinch is smaller with a large, pale, conical bill and no purple or blue on the head. Tui is very different in appearance but has similar song that can be distinguished (usually) by the inclusion of additional less musical notes than bellbird, e.g. grunts, clicks and wheezes.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Bellbirds are found in native and exotic forest, scrub, farm shelter belts, urban parks and gardens throughout the North, South, Stewart and Auckland Islands and many offshore islands, although notably rare on the mainland from Waikato northwards, other than on Coromandel Peninsula (where they are common).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Bellbirds are common throughout most of their range, and can reach extraordinarily high densities on predator-free offshore islands. For example, densities of 5.5 to 9.1 pairs per hectare have been reported from Aorangi Island, Poor Knights Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Bellbirds have survived well on the mainland and elsewhere in the presence of introduced predators, although they occur in much greater densities on predator-free islands. The cause of the rapid decline of the bellbird from Northland and around Auckland in the 1860s is a matter for speculation. At least nine attempts had been made to translocate bellbirds to islands or mainland sites up to 2012; most failed, and none has yet resulted in a well-established population.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Bellbirds breed in spring and summer, building a loose nest of twigs and grasses, lined with feathers and fine grasses. Most nests are in a fork under dense cover, from near ground level to &gt;5m. The clutch size is typically 3-4, rarely up to 5 eggs. The female incubates and both parents care for the young.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Bellbirds are territorial when breeding, but may leave the territory to feed at nearby sources of concentrated food, such as nectar. After breeding they move around, usually alone, although several may feed simultaneously in a flowering tree. Males are substantially larger than females and often dominate at concentrated food sources such as nectar sources. The outer primaries of males are notched and these produce a whirring when the birds are in flight and males accentuate the sound during territorial disputes. The oldest known bird was over 8 years. Banded birds have moved up to 10 km, but they are likely to move greater distances when searching for concentrated food source during winter. Birds that naturally colonised Tawharanui (North Auckland) are believed to have flown from Little Barrier Island 23 km away.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Bellbirds mainly feed on nectar from many native and introduced plants. In late summer and autumn they take fruit, and in beech forests they take honeydew from scale insects on beech trunks. Bellbirds also eat many insects and spiders by gleaning trunks, branches and leaves; also by hawking. Young appear to be fed insects almost exclusively.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Bellbird\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Bellbird</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/bellbird-korimako/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/bellbird-korimako/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/korimako.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/korimako.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Anderson, S.H.; Craig, J.L. 2003.

Male Chatham Island bellbirds were at least 10% greater in all measurements than their mainland counterparts, and had particularly long wings and legs. The head colour of Chatham males also was darker and tended towards blue, rather than the violet of mainland birds. Finally, the bright yellow iris of Chatham Island bellbirds was completely different from the wine-red iris colour of adult mainland bellbirds. Unfortunately, very little information is available about this striking species which became extinct about 1906.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The Chatham Island bellbird was green with a short, curved bill, slightly forked tail, and noisy whirring, fast and direct flight. Adult males were olive green, slightly paler on the underparts, with the forehead and crown steel blue, changing to a purplish-blue gloss on the sides of the head, nape, throat and upperbreast; the wings and tail were blackish. Females were browner, with a narrow white-yellow stripe across the cheek from the base of the bill, and bluish gloss on top of the head. Adults of both sexes had bright yellow eyes.

However, whilst W.L. Buller (who visited Chatham Island in c.1855) considered the song to be less musical, Henry Travers in the southern part of the group (1863 to 1890s) considered its song to be richer and fuller than that of mainland bellbirds.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island bellbirds were formerly found in native forest throughout the islands in the Chatham group, and were last recorded on Little Mangere Island in 1906.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>In 1855 the Chatham Island bellbird was present in forest around Waitangi, but by the 1880s it was absent from the vicinity of human settlements and more common in the as yet undisturbed forest of the southern part of the main island. In the early 1870s Travers found it in great numbers on Mangere Island, less common on the main island, and rare on Pitt Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island bellbirds were probably extirpated by introduced predators, particularly feral cats and rats (initially Pacific rats, then Norway rats), and latterly, collection for museum specimens.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The little information available is contradictory. Henry Travers reported that breeding commenced in October and continued into the summer, Potts gave the breeding season as August-October inclusive. However, an immature collected between May and July 1840 was moulting into adult plumage and the early timing of this moult supports the August-October breeding season. The nest had a diameter of 18 cm, and so was larger than that of bellbirds on mainland New Zealand. It was composed mainly of dry grasses with fibrous twigs on the outside, and lined with wool and small feathers. The clutch was typically 3 pink eggs with reddish-brown blotches on the larger end; the eggs measured 26 x 19 mm.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Buller considered the Chatham Island bellbird to behave similarly to the mainland species. If so, it would have been territorial when breeding, but may have left the territory to feed at nearby sources of concentrated food, such as nectar. Males were substantially larger than females and so probably dominated at concentrated food sources such as nectar-rich flowers. The outer primaries of males were notched and these produce a whirring when the birds are in flight, and so males probably accentuated the sound during territorial disputes.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>No information was recorded.

They look black from a distance, but in good light tui have a blue, green and bronze iridescent sheen, and distinctive white throat tufts (poi). They are usually very vocal, with a complicated mix of tuneful notes interspersed with coughs, grunts and wheezes. In flight, their bodies slant with the head higher than the tail, and their noisy whirring flight is interspersed with short glides.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Tui have almost-black heads, underparts, wings and tails that have an iridescent blue and green sheen, especially on the head and wings. The upper back and flanks are dark reddish brown with a bronze sheen, the nape and sides of the neck have filamentous white feathers, and there are two unusual curled white feather tufts on the throat (poi). Small white&#xA0;shoulder patches on the upperwing show prominently in flight, but are usually concealed when perched. The bill and feet are black, and the eye dark brown. The sexes are alike, but the male is larger. Adults have a notch on the 8th primary, and this feather quivers from the narrow part creating the whirring sound in flight.

Bellbirds have very similar song, but this is more fluid, and lacks the loud coughs, grunts and wheezes of tui.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Tui are widespread and locally abundant on the North, South and Stewart Islands, and their offshore islands; they are scarce only in drier, largely open country east of the Southern Alps. Tui are present on the Kermadec and Auckland Islands, and there is a larger subspecies endemic to the Chatham Islands. Tui are absent on the Poor Knights Islands probably due to the very high density of bellbirds there competing for a limited nectar resource. Tui are found in native forest and scrub (sometimes in exotic forests), and in rural gardens, stands of flowering kowhai and gums, and in suburban parks and gardens. There is much local movement, when tui follow a seasonal succession of flowering or fruiting plants. They usually nest in native forest and scrub, but will commute more than 10 km daily to feed on rich sources of nectar.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Tui are locally abundant on the mainland and on some offshore islands, especially where there is a concentration of flowering plants or fruiting trees (e.g. flowering kowhai, fuchsia, flax, rata or gums; or fruiting kahikatea) and generally in higher numbers in areas where there has been pest (possum and predator) control. They are common on the Kermadec and Auckland Islands, but are scarce on the main Chatham Island (they are more common in the southern Chatham Islands).</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Tui were the most common passerine found in Maori middens and were probably once an important source of protein. Despite the loss of the vast majority of lowland forest in New Zealand, tui have probably benefitted from the introduction to New Zealand of a variety of flowering and fruiting plants. These new species, as well as &#x2018;out-of-range&#x2019; plantings of native species and sugar-water feeders in gardens, now provide tui with a reliable year-round supply of nectar and fruit. Tui respond extremely well to pest control programmes targeting possums, rats and mustelids, which are probably their main nest predators.</p>\n<p>Recent attempts to reintroduce tui to Banks Peninsula, and Chatham Island tui to Chatham Island (from Rangatira Island), both in 2009-10, are showing encouraging signs of success.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Eggs are laid from September to January. The nest, built by the female, is a rough bulky structure of twigs and sticks, lined with fine grasses, high in the canopy or subcanopy. The clutch is 2-4 white or pale pink eggs, marked with reddish-brown spots and blotches. Incubation and brooding is by the female only. Chicks are initially fed only by the female, but later the male helps to feed them.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Tui are notoriously aggressive, and will defend a flowering or fruiting tree, or a small part of a large tree, from all-comers, whether another tui or another bird species. They vigorously chase other birds away from their feeding territory with loud whirring wings. Tui have a display flight, in which they fly upwards above the canopy, and then make a noisy, near-vertical, dive back into the canopy. Tui play a very important role in the dynamics of New Zealand forests because they are one of the most common pollinators of flowering plants, and also disperse the seeds of trees with medium-sized fruits.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Tui diet varies depending on the seasonal availability of nectar and fruits. Their preferred diet is nectar and honeydew, and they will often shift to, or commute daily or more frequently to, good nectar sources, such as stands of puriri, kowhai, fuchsia, rewarewa, flax, rata, pohutukawa, gums and banksias. In the breeding season, tui supplement their nectar diet with large invertebrates such as cicadas and stick insects obtained by hawking or by gleaning from the outside of trees. In the autumn, medium-sized fruit such as wineberry, kaikomako, mahoe, ngaio, rimu or kahikatea, make up much of the diet. In winter, flowering gums, banksias, puriri, and tree lucerne are important nectar sources, along with sugar-water feeders in gardens.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/tui/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/tui/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/tui.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/tui.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Craig, J.L.; Stewart, A.M.; Douglas, M.E.1981.

The circumstances surrounding the first one are obscure. It was first recorded as a skin in the Auckland Museum about 1855 and said to have been taken at Matakana in Northland. It was new to Buller and he named it as new, ironically choosing exactly the same specific name that it had already been described under. A second bird was collected at Rahotu in Taranaki in 1882 - shot by a taxidermist named Avery near the camp of soldiers taking part in the now infamous action against the Maori at Parihaka.

Due to this habit, the black-faced cuckoo-shrike is often called the shufflewing. Neither cuckoos nor shrikes, the undulating flight of these birds can resemble that of some cuckoos, and the predominantly grey plumage of many cuckoo-shrikes resembles such species as the common cuckoo of Europe, Asia and Africa. The shrike part of the name comes from the bill shape, which is similar to that of the Old-World shrike family.</p>\n<p>As one of the more regularly seen native birds in such Australian cities as Perth and Sydney, the black-faced cuckoo-shrike should be a familiar bird to many Australians. With a compound name comprising four parts, it is, unsurprisingly, one that not many people know how to label.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The black-faced cuckoo-shrike is a medium-large slender blue-grey songbird with a prominent black face and throat in adult plumage. Immature birds have a significantly reduced area of black, largely confined to the region between the beak and the ear-coverts, appearing as a smudgy bandit mask. Cuckoo-shrikes have a distinctive flight behaviour; after a few flaps of their wings, they hold their wings close to their body for a second or two, resulting in a loss of altitude before flapping again. This creates the cuckoo-like undulating flight pattern. Black-faced cuckoo-shrikes also hover, including whilst gleaning invertebrates from the leaves of trees.</p>\n<p>Voice: a liquid, pleasant, churring <em>chereer</em>, either singly or in a rolling sequence; also a flute-like call; a purring; and a harsh <em>shrilunk</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the white-bellied cuckoo-shrike (<em>C. papuensis</em>) of Australia can be distinguished by being smaller (22-29 cm); having a much smaller black mask between the bill and eye; and in most plumages having white or pale-grey belly and throat. There is a dark morph of one race of the white-bellied cuckoo-shrike which shows an extensive black hood, and in this morph the black extends onto the top of the head and crown, which is pale grey in the black-faced cuckoo-shrike. The voice of the white-bellied cuckoo-shrike is different also, and its <em>kisseek</em> call is diagnostic. North Island (or South Island) kokako has some similarities in plumage pattern to black-faced cuckoo-shrike but is twice the size, darker, has facial wattles, and is confined to dense native forest. The masked woodswallow is a much smaller bird (19 cm, 35 g) with a curved, grey bill with dark tip, and different flight behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Within Australia, the black-faced cuckoo-shrike is widely distributed as a breeding bird, but avoids sandy deserts and rainforests. Its strongholds are in the wooded south-east and coastal parts of Western Australia. It is a common suburban bird, and frequently perches on television aerials and telegraph wires. Movement of the birds in the non-breeding season is complex and incompletely understood, with some populations migrating as far north as the Solomon Islands, New Guinea and Indonesia, whilst other populations are apparently resident or sedentary. Before migrating, flocks of well over one hundred birds can assemble.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>More than 20&#xA0;records from widely scattered parts of New Zealand, including Stewart and Kapiti Islands, from most months of the year. A bird seen at North Kaipara Head in 1953 was apparently a long-stayer, being recorded over a six-month-long period.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black-faced cuckoo-shrikes may be faithful to one mate over a period of several years, and will use the same territory for a number of years. Both male and female birds construct the nest, incubate the eggs, and care for the young. The nest is a shallow cup of sticks, grass and bark, bound together by cobwebs, and often constructed on the fork of a branch. Apart from the re-arranging of wings that generally happens when birds land, there is also a display where birds extend their necks, and emit a harsh &#x201C;caw&#x201D; whilst alternately lifting their left and right wings a number of times.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black-faced cuckoo-shrikes eat insects, including caterpillars, and other invertebrates, also some fruit and seeds. They take food on the wing or on the ground, but primarily feed by foraging through foliage.

Illegal releases of aviary birds in Auckland during the 1990s resulted in a breeding feral population that has since been eradicated. The rainbow lorikeet is considered a horticultural and conservation pest species, and is an Unwanted Organism in New Zealand. If you think you have seen a rainbow lorikeet, phone the Ministry for Primary Industries Pests and Diseases Hotline 0800 80 99 66.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Rainbow lorikeets are slim, long-tailed, brightly coloured parrots that are similar in size to an eastern rosella. They have a bright red bill and blue head, unlike any other bird in New Zealand. The back, wings and tail are bright green, with a paler yellow-green band across the nape (red&#xA0; in <em>rubritorquis</em><em>)</em>, separating the blue head from the green mantle. The breast is orange and yellow, and the belly is violet-blue, with yellow and green between the legs and tail. The underwing coverts are orange, and a bold yellow stripe runs through the middle of the otherwise brown primaries (main flight feathers). The eye is red, and the legs grey.&#xA0; The sexes are alike.&#xA0; Juveniles are duller, with a brown bill.</p>\n<p>Voice: continuous loud screeching and chattering.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>No viable wild populations are known in New Zealand. Dozens were illegally and deliberately released on the North Shore, Auckland, during the 1990s. By 1999, a feral population estimated at 150-200 birds was established, with sightings from Whangaparaoa to Maraetai. They were successfully removed from the wild, mainly by live capture, between 2000 and 2002. A small flock was also removed from Rotorua in 2001-02. In New Zealand, rainbow lorikeets are mostly likely to occur in suburban parks and gardens, horticultural blocks, and forest edges.</p>\n<p>The natural range of rainbow lorikeets includes northern coasts of Australia, eastern Australia (from northern Queensland to South Australia; vagrant to or released in Tasmania), Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Timor-Leste and Indonesia. They have been introduced to Perth, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>No viable populations are known in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The main reasons that efforts are made to eradicate rainbow lorikeets in New Zealand is to eliminate any potential threat to horticulture, and to reduce the risk of parrot-specific diseases that they may carry infecting native parrots, including kakapo. Rainbow lorikeets also compete with other nectar-feeding species; in Auckland, they excluded tui from nectar feeders. They can occur in large flocks, and elsewhere damage apples, grapes and other soft fruit. Feral rainbow lorikeets in Auckland out-competed other species for nest holes. They may be kept in secure aviaries and cages, but it is illegal to release rainbow lorikeets to the wild.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Few data from wild New Zealand birds. Feral birds in Auckland prevented from nesting had uncompleted nests in hollow oak trees and in bird nest-boxes. A few young birds were recorded in wild flocks in winter 2000 &amp; 2001. In Australia, rainbow lorikeets are mainly spring breeders, nesting inside holes in living or dead trees. They breed as monogamous pairs, and are thought to maintain long-term pair bonds even when rejoining post-breeding flocks. Incubation is by the females, but the male frequently visits and may roost in the nest. Both sexes feed nestlings and fledglings. Incubation of the usually two, whitish eggs (28 x 23 mm) takes 22-25 days, fledging 56-64 days, and fledglings are fed for a further 2-3 weeks. Rainbow lorikeets are prolific breeders, capable of rearing as many as three broods in a season, and can breed when 12-15 months old.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Rainbow lorikeets are active, noisy and colourful, and may occur in large sociable flocks once established. Feeding flocks are usually fewer than 50 birds, but can be up to 1000 or more. They are strong fliers, travelling up to 30 km between feeding and roosting sites. They are usually seen in fast-flying pairs or flocks, feeding and roosting in tree tops. Rainbow lorikeets rarely come to the ground unless habituated to supplementary food, when they can become very tame. Traditional communal night-time roosts in large, isolated trees may be used by thousands of birds outside the breeding season. They are aggressive to conspecifics and other parrots and honeyeaters competing for the same food source, and have been observed dragging nestlings of other (Australian) parrot species out of tree hollows when competing for nest sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Rainbow lorikeets feed mainly on nectar and pollen in the outer canopy of trees. They also take fruit, seeds, and occasionally insects. Rainbow lorikeets are acrobatic feeders, often hanging head down to access flowers and fruit.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_lorikeet\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_lorikeet</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/animal-pests-a-z/rainbow-lorikeet/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/animal-pests-a-z/rainbow-lorikeet/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/rainbow-lorikeet-factsheet.pdf\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/rainbow-lorikeet-factsheet.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Higgins, P.J.

Unlike the three other species (pallid cuckoo, fan-tailed cuckoo and channel-billed cuckoo), the oriental cuckoo does not breed in Australia. As its name suggests it breeds in&#xA0;Asia, from Japan and Korea right across Siberia to the eastern edge of Europe. After leaving small warblers (e.g. willow warbler and chiffchaff) to care for its eggs and young, the oriental cuckoo spends the non-breeding season over a vast area between Malaysia and Australia, with occasional birds continuing on to New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The oriental cuckoo is a slender, medium-large cuckoo, about the size of a blackbird. Its proportions and shape are reminiscent of a small falcon. The plumage is variable, either dark grey, or rufous with heavy barring on the back, but all forms have white underparts that are heavily barred with black. The main colour morph of adults, including all males, has a smooth grey head and neck strongly demarcated from the heavily-barred breast and belly. The upper wings and back are dark grey, and the long, dark grey tail has bold white barring. The eye-ring, bill base and feet are bright yellow. The rarer rufous morph (females only) has also reached New Zealand, e.g. Raoul Island. This morph has a pale chin and face, with dark barring extending all the way from the chin to the undertail. The crown, nape, back, rump, upper wings and tail are rufous, strongly barred with dark brown. The soft parts are yellow, as for the grey morph.</p>\n<p>Voice: oriental cuckoos are generally silent in Australia and New Zealand, but a bird on Little Barrier Island (October 1971) uttered a quiet <em>tsoo-tsoo-tsoo</em> about a dozen times, at 1 second intervals.</p>\n<p>Similar species: shining cuckoo has similar bold barring underneath, but is metallic green above, and half the size. Pallid cuckoo is similar in size and shape, but is paler, with barring confined to the undertail.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The oriental cuckoo has a huge breeding range across northern Eurasia east to northern China, Korea and Japan. Its non-breeding range is similarly vast, including Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, and western Micronesia. It is a non-breeding migrant to northern and eastern Australia and a straggler to New Zealand. They are found in a range of open forest types and in farmland with scattered trees. In New Zealand, most oriental cuckoos have been recorded from lightly forested areas, with some in suburban gardens.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>There have been about three dozen records of oriental cuckoos from New Zealand, including 15 since 2000, meaning that, on average, one bird reaches New Zealand every year. Sightings have been distributed throughout the main and offshore islands from Raoul Island, Kermadec Islands in the north (December 2010) to the Snares Islands in the south (December 1986). The most recent record was from Lake Poteriteri, Fiordland (January 2015).

The first bird visited the same central Otago farm for three consecutive years during the non-breeding season (May-October), from 1939 to 1941. Several New Zealand sightings have been during the November-January breeding season, with the most recent being at Karori, Wellington in January 2006. Like most cuckoos, the pallid cuckoo is conspicuous by its loud, repeated calls during the breeding season, but the bird itself is often difficult to locate.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The pallid cuckoo is a medium-large cuckoo with the falcon-like profile characteristic of all <em>Cuculus</em> cuckoos. There are several quite different plumage stages or morphs, none of which have the heavily barred underparts of the similarly variable oriental cuckoo, and all showing bold white spots to the edge of the uppertail when at rest. Most adult males are pale grey, darker dorsally, with a dark stripe through the eye, a white spot on the nape and boldly barred black-and-white undersides to the wings and tail. A few males are darker grey, with all gradations in between. Females are more rufous in colour, and also vary between light and dark extremes, all with bold chestnut mottling on the dark upperparts, and some with a band of chestnut barring across the breast. All adults have the white spot on the nape and a narrow yellow eye-ring. Juveniles are boldly streaked and spotted with dark brown and white on the back, and are grey below, with buffy barring on the breast.</p>\n<p>Voice: males give a loud ascending whistle that can vary, with a series of slowly rising and accelerating melodic notes, <em>&#x201C;too, too...too, too&#x201D;.</em> The female has a hoarse ascending <em>&#x201C;wh-wh weeya wh-wh weeya&#x201D;.</em></p>\n<p>Similar species: the pallid cuckoo is most likely to be confused with the related oriental cuckoo, which is similar in size and shape, and has occurred in New Zealand about 36 times. The oriental cuckoo rarely calls when in Australia or New Zealand, and is much more heavily barred underneath than the pallid cuckoo. Oriental cuckoos also lack the white spots along the edge of the uppertail, which all pallid cuckoos have.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>The pallid cuckoo breeds in south-western and south-eastern Australia, migrating north after breeding to northern Australia, &#xA0;Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Moluccas and Lesser Sundas. It is common in Australia, but a vagrant to New Zealand, no breeding records here.</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The pallid cuckoo mainly occurs in shrublands and lightly timbered country in Australia, including grasslands, farmland, and mallee bush. It is also found in urban parks and gardens, wherever its host species are present.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>First recorded at Craig Flat, Otago in May 1939 through to Oct 1941, and subsequently at Okarito, Westland (December 1941), Greymouth (March 1942), Wairarapa (1977), Omarama, Otago (January 1990) and Karori, Wellington (November 2006).</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The pallid cuckoo breeds only in Australia, laying its eggs in nests of willie wagtails, honeyeaters, wood swallows, whistlers and flycatchers. Laying occurs from July to January in south-western Australia and August to November in south-eastern Australia. The female removes one of the host&apos;s eggs before replacing it with one of her own. Young pallid cuckoo chicks hatch before the chicks of the host, with the unhatched eggs being ejected.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Generally inconspicuous unless calling, pallid cuckoos sometimes perch in the open when foraging, e.g. on a fencepost, swooping down to the ground to catch insects and earthworms.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Pallid cuckoos are mainly insectivorous; snatching their prey from foliage and from the ground. Like many other cuckoo species, they specialise on species of hairy caterpillars, which other birds generally avoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.avianweb.com/pallidcuckoos.html\">http://www.avianweb.com/pallidcuckoos.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://planetbirds.blogspot.co.nz/2010/11/pallid-cuckoo.html\">http://planetbirds.blogspot.co.nz/2010/11/pallid-cuckoo.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Anderson, M.G.; Hauber, M.E. 2007a.

It is common throughout New Zealand but it is small and cryptically-coloured and so is more often heard than seen. It has a distinctive whistling call. Two intriguing aspects of its life history are its brood-parasitic habits and the long annual trans-oceanic migration.

Shining cuckoos are present in New Zealand in spring, summer and autumn only, either breeding or on passage to or from breeding locations.

It is unknown whether Chatham Island shining cuckoos are an overflow from New Zealand, of birds that can parasitise either warbler species, or whether they are an isolated subpopulation that only breeds on the Chatham Islands. If the latter is the case, then the Chatham Island subpopulation of shining cuckoos is perilously close to extinction.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Shining cuckoos are brood parasites, laying their eggs singly in nests of grey warblers (mainland) and Chatham Island warblers. Eggs are laid mostly in November, after which the adult cuckoos take no further part in breeding. Young cuckoos are dependent on their foster-parents for several weeks after fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Shining cuckoos are small diurnal birds with a strong, slightly down-curved beak. They are usually first seen or heard in September or October when they rapidly spread to forested areas throughout the country. They migrate north again in autumn. &#xA0;Despite their bright colouring, shining cuckoos are inconspicuous, usually staying among dense foliage. Their calls, while loud and easily recognisable, can be very difficult to track to source, with the bird often remaining concealed until put to flight. They are very prone to flying into windows, and for many New Zealanders their first or only awareness of the gorgeous iridescence of a shining cuckoo is when they find one stunned or dead beneath a large window. Foraging cuckoos can be quite approachable, especially when seeking kowhai moth caterpillars (<em>Uresiphita polygonalis</em>) in the open foliage of a kowhai tree. It is part of New Zealand bird lore that shining cuckoos are &#x201C;often killed by cats among the cinerarias&#x201D; while hunting the black hairy caterpillars of the magpie moth (<em>Nyctemera annulata</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Predominantly invertebrates. Like most cuckoo species, shining cuckoos have the ability to eat toxic insects like hairy caterpillars and ladybirds that are avoided by many other birds. They are one of the few New Zealand birds recorded eating monarch butterfly caterpillars, and taking red admiral butterfly caterpillars from tree nettle.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Bronze_Cuckoo\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Bronze_Cuckoo</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/pipiwharauroa.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/pipiwharauroa.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Falla, R.A.; Sibson, R.B.; Turbott, E.G. 1966. <em>A field guide to the birds of New Zealand and outlying islands</em>.

It mainly frequents forest, so is often difficult to observe closely. In flight its long tail (as long again as its body) makes it unmistakable, and its harsh screeching call is another point of distinction. Two intriguing aspects of its life history are its brood-parasitic habits and the long annual trans-oceanic migration. It breeds only in New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The long-tailed cuckoo is by far the larger of the two common cuckoos in New Zealand. It is brown and paler below, with bars, streaks and spots all over. The back and scapulars of adults are dark brown with numerous red-brown transverse bars; in immatures the back is dark brown with numerous large rounded cream-coloured spots. The breast and belly of adults are white with dark brown longitudinal streaks (usually thick); in immature birds, the underparts are suffused lightly to intensely with pale brown, and the dark brown longitudinal streaks are usually thinner than they are in adults. The sexes are alike.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: the principal call is a loud piercing, rising screech or shriek <em>zzhweeep</em>, often followed by a strident <em>pe-pe-pe-pe-pe-pe-pe</em>. Calls may be given at night as well as by day, including in flight by migrating birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: long-tailed cuckoos in flight have a superficial resemblance to a falcon. An adult New Zealand falcon has a relatively shorter tail (less than body length), a dark, strongly-hooked bill with yellow cere at its base, a prominent dark moustachial stripe on the cheek, and rufous flanks, thighs and undertail. Juvenile falcons are dark-plumaged, and unlikely to be confused with a cuckoo.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Long-tailed cuckoos can occur throughout New Zealand when migrating, otherwise they mainly occur in extensive native or exotic forest or scrub holding one or more of their three host species, on Little Barrier Island and&#xA0;from Waikato south. They are present in spring, summer and autumn only, either breeding or on passage to or from breeding locations. Birds seen in farmland or urban areas, where there are no host species, will be birds on passage. They are regularly seen on Raoul Island (Kermadec Islands), and are occasionally reported on the Chatham Islands and the Snares Islands, which is the southernmost record. Records of over-wintering birds are rare. During winter, long-tailed cuckoos occur in an arc of Pacific islands extending 11,000 km from Palau (Micronesia) in the west to Henderson Island (Pitcairn group) in the east. They have not been recorded in Australia or the main island of New Guinea.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To report sightings (or &apos;hearings&apos;) of&#xA0;long-tailed cuckoos, to contribute to a study of their migration patterns, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/108a7CJzA6_PglU4hngTFGnvEg2S4-TIU1-TYzIiWhi0/viewform\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Common in season at breeding locations. No population estimates or densities available.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The decline of yellowheads in both numbers and range has presumably caused a similar serious decline in the long-tailed cuckoos that were specialised in parasitising them. Despite six successful translocations of whitehead, the North Island host species, to e.g. Tiritiri Matangi Island, Mana Island and Zealandia/Karori Sanctuary dating back to 1989, long-tailed cuckoos have yet to recolonise any of these sites as breeders, suggesting that immature birds recruit to the near vicinity of where they were raised, rather than seeking new host populations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Parasitic. Lays eggs singly in nests of whitehead, brown creeper and yellowhead.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Long-tailed cuckoos are medium-sized diurnal birds with a strong, slightly down-curved bill, and aggressive predatory habits. They are vaguely raptor-like in flight and may be mobbed by smaller birds. They may call at night during migration. Long-tailed cuckoos are usually first seen or heard in September or October when they rapidly spread to forested areas throughout the country. Eggs are laid mostly in November and December, in the nests of three related species of&#xA0;song-birds, after which the adult cuckoos take no further part in breeding. Adults migrate north in February and March. Young cuckoos are dependent on their foster-parents for several weeks after fledging and their migration north is mainly in April and May, several months after the adults have departed. Immature cuckoos, with their brown-coloured underparts, dominate the cuckoo population in autumn, whereas in spring all birds returning to New Zealand are in adult plumage (body white below with dark brown streaks). There has been no detailed study of the breeding of long-tailed cuckoos, and many details of the eggs and young are poorly known.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Long-tailed cuckoos mainly eat invertebrates including large species of cicadas, weta and stick insects. They also eat small vertebrates including eggs and nestlings taken from birds&#x2019; nests (not necessarily those that have been parasitised) and lizards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/koekoea.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/koekoea.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bogert, C. 1937.

Its unusual elongated silhouette in flight is the source of its alternative name of &#x2018;flying walking-stick&#x2019;. It is both the largest cuckoo and the largest brood parasite in the world. The channel-billed cuckoo is a common migrant to Australia and a very occasional vagrant to New Zealand, where there have been six records scattered from the Far North to Invercargill.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Compared to other cuckoos, the channel-billed cuckoo is enormous. About the size of a New Zealand pigeon, it has a large, heavy downward curving pale yellow bill, and a very long grey tail with a black subterminal band and white tip. The head and neck are pale grey blue, merging into a paler breast and belly with faint barring. The back and wings are medium grey with rows of dark grey checks. The underwing is pale, with a prominent dark trailing edge. There is an orange-red patch of bare skin around the eye and to the base of the bill. Females are slightly smaller, with a smaller bill and paler, more barred undersides. Juveniles have buff rather than grey plumage, a less massive pinkish bill, and lack the red skin around the eye.</p>\n<p>Voice: a loud, melodious trumpeting.</p>\n<p>There are no similar species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The channel-billed cuckoo has very large range, extending throughout Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia and Pacific Islands including the Bismark Archipelago. It breeds throughout coastal forests of northern and eastern Australia, where it is present between September and April. Preferred habitats include subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, and subtropical or tropical mangrove forests.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>The first New Zealand record of channel-billed cuckoo was a bird shot in Invercargill in December 1924. The second was a bird at Ngataki, Aupori Peninsula October 1986 to January 1987. Three were found dead in October-November 1996 at Ocean Beach, Raglan; Te Paki, Far North; and Pukerua Bay, Wellington. The last confirmed sighting was one at Mangawhai Heads in October 2002. Details of a bird seen on Motiti Island in January 2007 have yet to be submitted to the Records Appraisal Committee of Birds New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The channel-billed cuckoo is an obligate brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of crows, magpies, butcher birds and currawongs. The introduced Australian magpie is a potential host in New Zealand. Courtship feeding has been observed in Australia, with the male presenting items of food such as insects to the female. Cuckoos have been observed working in pairs to provoke the host bird to leave the nest, allowing the female cuckoo to lay eggs in the host nest while the adult is distracted. Unlike most parasitic cuckoos, the chicks of the channel-billed cuckoo do not eject the host species&#x2019; eggs or chicks. However, the chicks of the channel-billed cuckoo grow quickly and dominate the food supply, and so the host chicks rarely fledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, channel-billed cuckoos have been observed to congregate in large raucous flocks. It is a strong flier, with a distinctive, almost hawk-like cruciform flight silhouette, and a wingspan of about a metre. It is thought that channel-billed cuckoos form pair bonds for the duration of the breeding season in Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The channel-billed cuckoo is predominantly fruigivorous, mainly eating figs. It also takes large invertebrates, and the eggs and chicks of other birds. There are no records of its diet in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel-billed_Cuckoo\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel-billed_Cuckoo</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Anderson, M.G.; Hauber, M.E.2007.

Found in both native and plantation forests, its distinctive &#x201C;more-pork&#x201D; call is commonly heard at night in many urban parks and well-vegetated suburbs. Moreporks are relatively common throughout much of New Zealand but are sparse through the eastern and central South Island. Their diet consists of insects, small mammals and birds, which it hunts at night.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The morepork is a small, compact, dark-brown owl. Its striking yellow to yellowish-green eyes are set into two facial disks either side of a small sharply hooked bill. The back feathers are dark-brown spotted sparsely with off-white. The breast is dark-brown variably streaked with cream and brown through to rufous. The legs are feathered legs down to the yellow feet. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Voice: All calls are given only at night. The onomatopoeic &#x2018;more-pork&#x2019; call is the most characteristic and often heard call. They also utter a repetitive &#x2018;quork-quork&#x2019; and a rising &#x2018;quee&#x2019; call. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Similar species: little owls are the only other small species of owl in New Zealand. They are paler than morepork, more grey-brown than dark-brown, and heavily spotted and streaked with cream. They are found only in open habitats in South Island, with minimal range overlap with morepork. The rising &#x2018;quee&#x2019; call is often mistaken for a kiwi call.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Moreporks are widely distributed throughout the native and exotic forests of New Zealand. They are uncommon in the drier eastern regions of the South Island, especially south of Christchurch. They also occur in more open areas where suitable patches of vegetation remain including sparsely-wooded farmland, and within some urban parks and gardens. Moreporks inhabit most forested offshore islands from the Three Kings Islands south to some of the muttonbird islands off the south-west tip of Stewart Island. They are naturally absent from the Poor Knights Islands and Chatham Islands, and vagrant to the Snares Islands. Moreporks roost in dark forested areas with high overhead cover, on a branch, on top of a tree fern or within a cavity. They sometimes roost inside derelict buildings.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Widespread and moderately abundant. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Prone to predation when nesting, by cats, possum, rats and mustelids. When nesting on the ground eggs and chicks may also be susceptible to predation by pigs and hedgehogs. Sex bias towards males recorded in the Eglington Valley suggests that females may be vulnerable to predation when incubating and brooding in cavities. Low productivity was recorded in studies in the Eglington Valley (Fiordland) and on Ponui Island (Hauraki Gulf), but the causes are unclear. Moreporks are vulnerable to secondary poisoning from pest control operations using brodifacoum poison. Morepork diet is related to prey abundance, suggesting that the risk of secondary poisoning could be reduced by conducting pest animal control operations at times of year when moreporks are not targeting rodents.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreporks breed readily in captivity. Two captive males from New Zealand were released on Norfolk Island in 1987 to provide a mate for the last surviving Norfolk Island boobook owl. This was successful, and the pair produced several young before the female died in the mid 1990s. A hybrid morepork/boobook population persists on Norfolk Island as a result.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreporks breed in spring and summer. Nests are usually placed within cavities of live or dead trees, within broken logs, in a tree fork or within a hole in an earth bank, including in petrel burrows. They also nest in epiphytes, in nest boxes put up for other species, or in a simple scrape on the ground under tree fern fronds, a rock, or among the roots of trees - anywhere that provides a dark hideaway. The 1-3 eggs are incubated by the female only. Incubation takes about 25 days, and chicks fledge when about 7 weeks old. Both adults feed the young.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The morepork has short, broad wings making it very manoeuvrable and able to fly through dense forest. Like other owls it has serrated or comb like edges to its flight feathers that reduce air turbulence over the wing, enabling silent flight. Moreporks are most often seen when they approach street lights or lights on the outside of buildings, to hunt moths that are attracted to the light. They commonly fly into windows, and are often hit by vehicles. Moreporks strongly defend a territory of 3.5 to 7.8 ha. Birds that appear to be calling together in a &#x2018;duet&#x2019; are usually rival males duelling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreporks catch and consume a wide variety of small animals, including large insects, small birds, (especially silvereyes), and small mammals. The diet varies with season, generally in proportion to abundance of prey species. Insects taken include huhu beetles, weta, cicadas and large moths. Indigestible material are ejected through the mouth as a pellet.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/morepork-ruru/\">www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/morepork-ruru/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.wingspan.co.nz/\">www.wingspan.co.nz</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Environment/Natural-resources/Biodiversity/Hamilton-Halo/Hamilton-city-morepork-survey/\">www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Environment/Natural-resources/Biodiversity/Hamilton-Halo/Hamilton-city-morepork-survey/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Denny, K.M. 2009.

The last confirmed record was a dead specimen from South Canterbury found in 1914, but sight and sound records continued to be reported from both islands into the 1930s. Laughing owls coexisted with early European settlement, but the introduction of stoats, ferrets, and weasels is thought to have led to their extinction.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Laughing owls were about twice the size of a morepork. Adults were dark brown above with buff-yellow longitudinal stripes; each feather had a brown centre almost to the tip and a broad buff-yellow edge. The underparts were yellowish-brown to buff, prominently streaked with dark brown or reddish-brown. The wings and tail were brown with paler bars. The legs were covered to the toes with bristly pale yellow feathers. The facial disk was pale apart from thin, dark brown shaft-streaks. Newly hatched young were sparsely covered with coarse, yellowish-white down.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a loud and varied repertoire included &#x201C;doleful shrieks&#x201D;, a &#x201C;prolonged cack-cack-cack&#x201D; which was reportedly repeated incessantly on rainy nights, a call similar to &#x201C;two men cooeying to each other over a distance&#x201D; given by a captive pair at dusk, and a barking noise &#x201C;just like the yelping of a young dog&#x201D;.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: morepork is half the size and much darker, especially on the face and underparts. Barn owl is much paler, almost white underneath.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Originally found throughout New Zealand, but by the time Europeans arrived laughing owls were only recorded south of a line from Taranaki to East Cape in the North Island, and in Nelson, Marlborough, east of the main divide in the South Island, and on Stewart Island. Laughing owls lived in both open country and forested areas. They roosted in caves or fissures in rock faces and on rock ledges.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Laughing owls may have been declining in the North Island before major European settlement, but were reportedly common in the Urewera Ranges in pre-European times. Only two specimens were collected from the North Island, both of which are now lost. They were common in the South Island in the mid-1800s, but thereafter declined rapidly. The last reported specimen was collected in 1914, and they were probably extinct by 1940. The introduced Pacific rat or kiore (<em>Rattus exulans</em>) formed an important part of the owl&#x2019;s diet following Polynesian arrival, and is unlikely to have contributed to the owl&#x2019;s decline as they coexisted for hundreds of years in the South Island. The rapid decline to extinction of the laughing owl has been attributed to the introduction of stoats, ferrets, and weasels to control rabbits in the 1880s.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The nest consisted of dried grasses placed directly on the ground in caves, rock fissures, rock ledges, under boulders, and possibly tree holes. Nest sites were often used for considerable periods of time and the accumulated debris of prey remains gives a unique insight into the small vertebrates (including birds, reptiles and bats) in New Zealand ecosystems before human arrival. The two white eggs (47 mm x 39 mm) were laid in September-October. Chicks hatched after 25 days and were reared during October-November. The female is thought to have incubated alone, though fed throughout by the male.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The laughing owl was a nocturnal, generalist predator. Prior to human settlement it fed on small- to medium-sized birds, frogs, bats, lizards, juvenile tuatara, and larger insects. Following Polynesian arrival, and the modification of the South Island east coast environment which resulted in a decline in its traditional prey, the Pacific rat became an important component of the owl&#x2019;s diet.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_Owl\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_Owl</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/birds-of-prey/1/2\">www.teara.govt.nz/en/birds-of-prey/1/2</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gill, B. 1996.

Unlike the morepork, they are often seen perched out in the open during the day. Little owls were introduced to New Zealand from Germany between 1906 and 1910, with the intention that they would help control the numbers of small introduced birds, which were becoming a pest in grain and fruit crops. With the exception of one pair released in Rotorua, all were liberated in the South Island. Little owls bob up and down if startled and have an undulating flight pattern.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little owls are small, plump grey-brown owls, much streaked and spotted with white. They have pale grey facial discs either side of their face just below the eyes, and prominent white bands above the bright yellow eyes and below the chin. The legs have thick white feathering all the way down to the pale yellow-grey toes. They are more active during the day than moreporks, and are often seen perched in the open during daylight hours, on power poles, fence posts, roof-tops or in trees.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: the distinctive &#x2018;kiew&#x2019; contact call of the little owl is a common evening sound throughout lowland Nelson, Marlborough, Canterbury, Otago and Southland.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the little owl is slightly smaller and much paler than the morepork. The little owl also has a shorter tail and a more flattened top to its head. The two species rarely occur in the same sites and habitats, as moreporks are scarce or absent from much of the dry, open farmland of eastern and northern South Island, and little owls do not live in forest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little owls are restricted to the South Island. They are widely distributed throughout the drier eastern areas and are more common towards the coast. They are also found in the Nelson region, but are rare on the West Coast. They inhabit farmland and urban areas, often around farm buildings, small stands of open trees and hedgerows.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A total of 219 little owls were imported and released by the Otago Acclimatisation Society between 1906 and 1910. Additional birds were released in the Canterbury region around the same time. They spread rapidly, and are common throughout the eastern South Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little owls were introduced with the intension that they would limit populations of introduced finches and sparrows, and thereby reduce crop damage. There is no evidence that they have been effective in this, nor are little owls considered a significant threat as a predator to any native bird species. They are a major predator of the endangered Cromwell chafer beetle (<em>Prodontria lewisi</em>), and may limit the beetle&#x2019;s population. The largely non-overlapping distributions of little owl and morepork are suggestive of competitive exclusion. This may be driven more by habitat preferences than direct interactions, but this has not been studied.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Breeding occurs during the months of October to January. It is generally a cavity nester and will use trees, stacked hay bales, old buildings, banks or rocky crevices. The female is solely responsible for &#xA0;incubation of the 2-5 white eggs, which takes about 28 days. The chicks leave the nest after about 33 days.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Little owls are solitary and are most often seen perched in the open in the late afternoon. They mainly hunt at dawn and dusk, often feeding on the ground, where they walk and run freely (unlike morepork).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In New Zealand, little owls mainly eat insects (particularly beetles, also caterpillars, earwigs and moths); they eat small mammals, small birds, lizards and frogs.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob7570.htm\">http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob7570.htm</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/l/littleowl/index.aspx\">http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/l/littleowl/index.aspx</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wingspan.co.nz/birds_of_prey.html\">http://www.wingspan.co.nz/birds_of_prey.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Bull, P.C.; Gaze, P.D.; Robertson, C.J.R. 1985. <em>The atlas of bird distribution in New Zealand</em>.

While rural birds are usually quite timid, flying off at close approach, urban birds are often quite the opposite, walking about at one&#x2019;s feet and even alighting on people to take food. It is a gregarious species, often roosting, commuting and foraging in flocks.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wild rock pigeons in New Zealand are the result of introductions for aviculture and racing. As a result, they occur in a wide variety of plumages, including entirely black, the wild type of predominately grey with black wings bars, red-brown, buff, and white, and pied variants of each of the colour forms. The wild-type rock pigeon is blue-grey, with lighter tones over the back and wings, has a white rump, and the tail has a black terminal band. There are two black bands over the inner portion of the upper-wing, and the outer flight feathers are black or dark grey. There is a broad band of iridescent purple-green over the neck, upper mantle and chest. The bill is grey-black, the cere white, feet pink to red-pink, and the eyes red. Juveniles are smaller and slimmer than adults, with duller plumage lacking iridescence, feet grey to pink-grey, bill pink or grey-pink, eyes brownish, and cere pink or grey. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a variety of &#x201C;coo&#x201D; calls are given, often associated with male courtship displays and at potential nest sites, but also when alarmed and in defence of the nest. Although not a vocalisation, wing claps over the back are often given when birds first take off from a roost, particularly at the start of a flight display. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: there is no other species that is similar in appearance to the rock pigeon in New Zealand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The rock pigeon occurs from Northland to Southland, and is largely confined to towns, cities and agricultural land. There are few records of its occurrence in the central North Island and along the West Coast of the South Island. Rock pigeons, including &#x2018;lost&#x2019; homing pigeons, have been recorded as vagrants on the Chatham, Snares and Antipodes Islands.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In urban and rural environments,&#xA0;rock pigeons utilise a wide variety of habitats in which to forage, roost and nest. Although developing and mature seeds of grasses and various weeds are obtained from lawns, gardens and along roadsides, the bulk of food eaten by rock pigeons is purposely or inadvertently provided by people in towns, cities and on farms. In addition, rock pigeons forage along the high-tide line of beaches. Rock pigeons roost and nest on and in buildings, both disused and in use, under bridges and wharves, and on ledges of cliffs and caves. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rock pigeons are widespread and regionally abundant, particularly in association with large cities and extensive arable farmland. The population is expanding, which is apparent when the distributions of this species from the 1969-79 and 1999-2004 Ornithological Society of New Zealand&#x2019;s atlas schemes are compared. &#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Urban residents often have a love-hate relationship with rock pigeons, which are the most abundant bird species in many city centres. Their faeces can spread diseases such as salmonella, and can cause fouling of buildings, statues, vehicles and footpaths. Control programmes are occasionally undertaken by or for city authorities, usually using the toxin alphachloralose applied to grain. Such programmes are often controversial, especially if dead and dying pigeons are encountered by people who value them. Large amounts of money are also spent &#x2018;pigeon-proofing&#x2019; buildings and other structures, usually by installing fine wires and spikes to prevent birds accessing potential roosting or nesting sites. Rock pigeons in rural areas can cause considerable damage to newly-sown crops of peas, maize and beans. Domestic forms of the rock pigeon are widely kept as pets, display birds and homing pigeons.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most nests are situated on ledges in buildings, caves or cliffs. A variety of materials are used to form the nest, including twigs, grass stems, plastic drinking straws, bits of paper and even just the accumulated dried faecal material deposited by previous broods. Rock pigeons are able to initiate a nesting cycle in any month, but most clutches are laid in spring and summer. Clutch size is typically 2 eggs, although occasionally 1-, 3- or 4-egg clutches occur. Pair members share incubation and care of young. Chicks start flying when about 30 days old, but remain near the nest for another week before dispersing with their parents. Some pairs with large young in one nest will start incubating a new clutch in a separate nest or even in the same nest. Nesting success was 76% of eggs in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay (rural), and 57% in Wellington (CBD), with mean brood size at fledging being 0.9 and 0.8 respectively.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When commuting between roosting and foraging sites, rock pigeons fly directly and quickly with steady-paced wing beats. They may travel several kilometres to reach foraging sites. Rock pigeons generally forage in pairs or as a loose flock, with almost all searching for food being carried out while walking about on the ground. Often during spring and summer, males at foraging sites will court females. This involves the male standing erect with head bowed, plumage puffed out and tail fanned, walking and running about the female while cooing loudly. Nest sites are vigorously defended, sometimes resulting in fights for occupancy.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The successful colonisation of most continents and climates by the rock pigeon relates in large part to its ability to feed on a wide variety of foods, particularly human foods. In urban areas the diet consists mainly of food refuse and scraps, and in rural areas mainly commercial grains (peas, maize, barley, wheat, oats, and clover), either newly-sown or among stubble. In addition, pigeons forage along the high-tide line for food items washed ashore. Invertebrates, such as earthworms and snails, make up a small portion of the diet.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Dove\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Dove</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_Pigeon\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_Pigeon</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Dilks, P.J. 1975.

It has been domesticated for many hundreds of years, something that is reflected in its confiding and gentle nature. Because of its long dependence on people, it seems less able than other dove species to survive for long in the wild. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Barbary dove is pale, fallow brown above and creamy buff to peach pink below. The head is sometimes paler than the body, with a narrow crescent of black feathers extending from side to side across the back of the neck. This half-collar is fringed with white in adult males, less so in females. Otherwise, the sexes are alike. The primary and secondary wing feathers are grey-brown, with the primaries having pale edges to them, accentuating their outline. The upper wing coverts, tertial and scapular feathers are sandy brown, while the underwing coverts are off-white. The rump and upper tail coverts are pale brown with a faint grey wash; undertail coverts white. The greyish brown central tail feathers contrast with the outer tail feathers, which are darker with prominent white tips, extending up to half the length of the feather. Immature birds are paler than adults, with distinct pale brown edges to the upper wing coverts, tertials and scapulars; the collar is either absent or only faintly defined. In adults, the iris is red, in contrast to the pale yellow-brown of immature birds. Leg colour also differs, being deep pink in adults, and grey-brown in immatures. The bill is dark grey at all ages. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Call: a soft, melodious, repeated two-note phrase, <em>coo crrooo</em>, with a brief pause between the two syllables; also has a <em>heh-heh-heh-heh</em> challenge or greeting call, given when approaching another individual. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: spotted dove is larger, darker grey-brown above, pink-brown below, with a white-spotted black patch on the sides and back of the neck rather than a black half-collar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Introduced to Nelson in 1867 but did not establish. Released later (unsuccessfully) in Canterbury and Dunedin. An introduction around Masterton, sometime before 1971, led to the establishment of a feral breeding population there in the early 1970s, but none was recorded from the region during the 1999-2000 Bird Atlas survey, suggesting that this introduction also failed. The populations established in Northland (Kerikeri, Whangarei), around Auckland, central Waikato, and in Hawkes Bay, centred on Hastings, are assumed to be derived from birds that escaped or were released from local aviaries. This is continuing, with Barbary doves occasionally reported from New Plymouth, Wanganui, Horowhenua, Wellington, Blenheim, Christchurch, and Dunedin.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Not known but probably small. Barbary doves were reported from just 2.3 % of 3192 10-km grid squares and in only 0.6% of 31,672 record sheets during the 1999-2004 Bird Atlas survey. It was recorded in just 1.4% of the 3683 data sheets returned for the 2012 winter Garden Bird survey with, on average, about 5 birds counted on each occasion.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">An introduced species whose small numbers, sparse distribution, and apparently limited ability to persist in the wild, means that it likely has negligible ecological and economic impacts at present.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The nest is a loose platform of sticks, placed in a tree, hedge, or on a suitable ledge in an outbuilding. Both sexes build the nest, collecting sticks and twigs from the ground nearby. As in other dove species, Barbary doves almost invariably lay two oval white eggs, 1-2 days apart. Chicks hatch after about 14 days incubation. Both sexes incubate and brood the young chicks for the first few days after hatching, the male doing so mostly during the middle of the day; the female overnight. Chicks are fed initially on a milky secretion from the adult&#x2019;s crop, often referred to as &#x2018;dove&#x2019;s milk&#x2019;. Once their feathers begin to grow, around day 5, the chicks are brooded less often and fed regurgitated seeds. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Barbary dove is a tame and confiding species, gregarious outside the breeding season, often associating with spotted doves, where present. During the breeding season, males are territorial and advertise their presence with a repeated <em>coo crrroo</em> call, given for extended periods of time from a conspicuous perch. Males also have a display flight, flying steeply upwards while clapping their wings, then gliding back to a perch with wings and tail stiffly spread. Clashes over territory can occur, with both birds using their wings alternately to beat each other. Males court females by giving the bow-coo display. In this, the male stretches up, filling its anterior air sacs, then bows and calls <em>coo crrroo</em>; the more intense the display, the more accentuated the second syllable of the call. Both sexes call, but females&#x2019; calls are usually quieter with more of a trill <em>coo crrroo.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Birds arriving at a perch supporting other doves often give a rapid <em>heh-heh-heh-heh-heh</em> call that some people liken to a laugh. This seems to be a greeting call. If the arriving bird is a male and the one already on the perch a female, the incoming bird starts displaying with the bow-coo display. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Barbary doves feed on the ground on the seeds of grasses, cereal crops and herbs. Birds will occasionally stretch up to peck seed from inflorescences close to the ground.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://ebird.org/ebird/newzealand/map/afcdov1\">http://ebird.org/ebird/newzealand/map/afcdov1</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdforum.net/opus/Streptopelia_roseogrisea\">http://www.birdforum.net/opus/Streptopelia_roseogrisea</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/915273/details\">http://eol.org/pages/915273/details</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Streptopelia_risoria.html\">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Streptopelia_risoria.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ball, G.F.; Silver, R. 1983.

No doubt this population has been supplemented periodically by other releases and escapes from captivity. Recent molecular genetic studies suggest that this species and the African laughing dove form a distinct group within the genus <em>Streptopelia</em>, leading some authorities to put them in a separate genus, <em>Stigmatopelia.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The spotted dove is a medium-sized, somewhat long-tailed dove with a greyish head, pink-grey underparts, and speckled greyish brown upperparts. Its distinguishing feature is a large white-spotted black half-collar around the back and sides of the neck. The main flight feathers are dark grey, faintly tinged brown. Wing coverts, tertiaries, scapulars and upper back feathers are brownish grey with pale tips and dark centres, creating a speckled appearance. The central tail feathers and long upper tail coverts are brown, while the outer tail feathers are dark grey, the three outermost ones having white tips. The amount of white increases towards the outside of the tail; on the last feather it covers up to one-third of the total length. The legs are deep pink, and the iris red. The sexes are alike, although females are smaller with a less strikingly marked neck patch. Juveniles lack the prominent domino neck patch; their wing coverts and scapulars have pale brown edges; and the iris is brown-yellow. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a deep, slightly lilting <em>coo corrr cuk</em>, the inflection of each syllable rising slightly then falling. This 3-second phrase is repeated over and again, for minutes at a time. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: Barbary dove is smaller, paler, and distinguished by having a black half-collar on the neck, rather than a white-spotted black neck patch. Rock&#xA0;pigeon is larger, stockier and generally much darker grey. Spotted doves are known to hybridise with both species. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The 1999-2004 Bird Atlas survey, and current records in eBird New Zealand show spotted doves occurring widely from Whangarei south to Hamilton, and in coastal Bay of Plenty between Katikati and Whakatane. The few records outside these areas are either birds seen in animal parks or ones likely to have been released or escaped from captivity. There were no records from the South Island. Spotted doves occur mainly in urban parks and gardens. In its native range, the species occurs in moist open forests, woodland, cultivated areas, and around human settlement.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted doves were reported from just 3.1 % of the 3192 10-km grid squares during the 1999-2004 Bird Atlas survey, and in only 1.1% of 31,672 record sheets. In the 2012 winter Garden Bird survey, spotted doves were recorded in 4.9 % of the 3683 data sheets; on average, just over 4 birds were noted on each occasion. Reports of the species&#x2019; occurrence around Auckland from 1950 to mid-1980s indicate a rate of radial expansion in its range of just under 2 km per year.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted doves are not known to have any significant negative ecological or economic impacts. Small flocks may gather to feed on spilled grain or harvest leftovers. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted doves breed primarily in spring and summer, but can breed at other times of the year if there is sufficient food and mild weather. The nest is a shallow platform of twigs, usually placed above 3 m in a tree or bush, or even in structures such as disused railway stock wagons. The 2 eggs are incubated by both sexes. Nestlings are semi-altricial, covered at first with wispy down and brooded and fed by both parents, initially with a secretion called &#x2018;crop milk&#x2019;. Once the feathers begin to develop, the chicks are brooded less, and are fed regurgitated seed. More than one brood can be raised in a season.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted doves occur mostly in pairs or small flocks, foraging on the ground and perching in trees or on overhead telephone wires. Their flight is rapid, powerful and direct, but birds leaving a perch to forage on the ground often glide down quietly. Males have an aerial advertising display in which they fly steeply and noisily up to 20-30 m before turning and gliding on stiffly spread wings and tail down to their perch. Courting males perform an exaggerated bow, first raising themselves up, filling their air sacs, then bowing down, expelling the air while calling loudly <em>cu-coo coorrr</em>. At other times, a bird will sit and call <em>cuk cuk coorrr</em> from a perch, this call being softer and less insistent than that given during the bow-coo display. Both sexes give this perch-coo call, but the female&#x2019;s call is quieter. Mated birds preen each other (allopreening), especially around the head and neck. Aggressive behaviour normally includes a threatening <em>kirr</em> call, but this can escalate into physical confrontation involving wing slapping.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spotted doves forage on the ground in grassland, cultivated areas and around homesteads, feeding on the seeds of grasses, cereals, small herbs and fallen seeds. Birds will occasionally reach up and strip seeds from growing plants. In the tropics they have been seen eating termites, and so may take insects occasionally.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Web links</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ebird.org/ebird/newzealand/map/spodov\">http://ebird.org/ebird/newzealand/map/spodov</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1050136/entries/39179349/details\">http://eol.org/pages/1050136/entries/39179349/details</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdforum.net/opus/Spotted_Dove\">http://www.birdforum.net/opus/Spotted_Dove</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Cheke, A.S. 2005.

This is because the New Zealand pigeon (or kereru) has a widespread distribution through the country, being present in extensive tracts of native forest, and rural and urban habitats, including most cities. As well as allowing close approach, it often roosts conspicuously, such as on powerlines or on the tops of trees. The distinctive sound of its wing beats in flight also draws attention. Kereru also frequently feature on works of art, such as paintings and sculptures. However, even though it is widespread, like many forest birds its abundance is severely compromised by introduced mammals, particularly possums, stoats and ship rats. Only where these pests are not present (predator-free islands) or are controlled to low levels do kereru populations thrive.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although there is some individual variation, in general the upper parts of adult kereru are blue-green, with a purple-bronze iridescence on the neck, mantle and coverts of the wings. The underparts are white with a sharp demarcation between the white and blue-green on the upper breast. The bill colouration is quite variable, from uniformly red, but often having a paler red or even orangey tip, and feet and eyes crimson. Fledglings and juveniles have duller plumage, and often the white chest is smudgy white-grey, and the demarcation between dark and white feathering is ragged and may have a narrow border of cinnamon wash over the upper white feathers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: kereru are generally silent except for occasional &#x2018;oos&#x2019;. Brief, moderate volume &#x2018;oos&#x2019; are given when alarmed, such as a harrier flying close by, and longer, low volume &#x2018;oooooos&#x2019;, with a rising tone towards the end given as contact calls, often repeated several times. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is no other species in New Zealand that looks similar to the New Zealand pigeon, apart from the Chatham Island pigeon, which is confined to the Chatham Islands. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kereru are widespread through the country from Northland to Stewart Island, and on some offshore islands that have suitable forest / shrubland habitats.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kereru inhabit a wide variety of forest types: podocarp-broadleaf forest, beech forest, second growth native forest regenerating after logging, small forest remnants, and exotic plantations (especially those with an understorey and/or stream-sides of native shrubs and trees). They also occur in farmland shelterbelts, urban parks, and rural and suburban gardens. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kereru are widespread through the country, and are seasonally common at some locations where they gather in moderate-sized feeding flocks (20-50 birds, and rarely over 100). </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although a major issue for conservation of the kereru in the early 1900s, habitat loss probably has little impact on regional populations today. The main threat to kereru is predation by introduced mammalian predators, particularly feral cats, possums, stoats and ship rats, especially when nesting. Other mortality factors include collisions with fast moving vehicles, overhead power and telephone wires and windows, electrocution when perched on some power poles, and illegal hunting. Where pest populations are removed (offshore islands, exclusion fenced areas) or controlled to very low levels kereru populations have increased markedly.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kereru have been recorded breeding in all months, but most eggs are laid in September-April. Pigeons in native forest have been recorded not breeding when little or no fruit was available. The nest is a platform of dead twigs, and a single egg is laid. In general, females incubate from late afternoon until mid-morning, when the male takes over. The chick is brooded constantly until it is about 10 days old and well covered with feathers. From then until fledging at about 35-40 days of age, it is left alone by day, with the occasional brief visit by a parent to feed it. When fruit is readily available, pairs are able to have overlapping nesting attempts; a large chick in one nest and an egg being incubated in another. Pairs that have failed nesting attempts (due to predators, poor nest construction or a storm) often re-nest within a week or two. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the non-breeding season, kereru can be fairly inconspicuous, feeding and then roosting under a thick canopy for sometimes hours at a time. In the breeding season, they can be just the opposite, perching on top of trees and males giving frequent display flights at the start of a nesting cycle. While not a territorial species, an individual will defend a food tree against other pigeons attempting to feed in it too. Fights involve hitting each other with their wings while flapping about in flight and moving only a metre or two.&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While some individuals can spend weeks or months living within an area of a few hectares, such periods can be interspersed with long-distance flights to reach seasonal food sources. For example, one satellite-tagged Southland pigeon travelled at least 480 km during a 100-day period, involving four crossings of Foveaux Strait. A few tagged pigeons in Taranaki flew up to 60 km to reach autumn fruit sources. Thus the species is able to travel between suburbia, remnant forest patches, extensive tracts of native forest and other habitats in their quest for seasonally available foods. Combined with the kereru&#x2019;s large size (and hence large mouth-width) and diet of fruit, these landscape-scale movements make kereru the most important vector for the transfer of seeds between widely-spaced fragments of native forest. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Foods include buds, leaves, flowers and fruit from a wide variety species, both native and exotic. In addition, they have been seen feeding on the fruiting bodies of the parasitic strawberry fungus <em>Cyttaria gunnii</em> found in beech forest. While most foods are taken while clambering about on vines, shrubs and trees, at a few locations kereru spend time on the ground feeding on clover and possibly other herbs. While ripe fruit seems to be the preferred food, in most regions fruit is not available year round, and so kereru then feed on leaves. Important leaf sources include those of kowhai, tree lucerne, broom, willows, elms and poplars.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kereru Discovery <a href=\"http://www.kererudiscovery.org.nz/\">http://www.kererudiscovery.org.nz/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Project Kereru <a href=\"http://www.projectkereru.org.nz/\">http://www.projectkereru.org.nz/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kereru Awhina Project <a href=\"http://www.kereru.org.nz/\">http://www.kereru.org.nz</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kereru Taonga PowerPoint presentation <a href=\"http://www.slideserve.com/oro/kereru-he-taonga-tuku-iho\">http://www.slideserve.com/oro/kereru-he-taonga-tuku-iho</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Clout, M. 1990.

Because it is mainly restricted to southern Chatham Island, where extensive forest habitat still occurs, the sight of a parea is not an everyday occurrence for most Chatham Islanders. However, like its closely-related species in New Zealand, the kereru, parea often roost conspicuously on tree tops and allow close approach, and so good sightings can often be had once an individual is seen. During spring, parea spend much time feeding on clover leaves, including along roadsides. The species&#x2019; improved conservation status since the 1990s is mainly due to ongoing pest control, particularly of feral cats.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification </strong></p>\n<p>The head, neck and upper breast of parea are blackish blue with a faint green and blue iridescence; the mantle and wing coverts are maroon with maroon iridescence. The rump and tail coverts are pale grey with a faint green wash, contrasting with the darker back and wing coverts. The exposed portions of the flight feathers are mainly grey. The upper surfaces of the tail feathers are black, and the lower breast and belly are white. Strikingly, the bill is red with a robust orange tip, and the legs and eyes crimson. Fledglings and juveniles have duller plumage, and often the white breast is smudgy white-grey, with the demarcation between black-blue and white feathering being ragged, and there may be a narrow border of cinnamon wash over the upper white breast feathers.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Voice: parea are generally silent except for occasional &#x2018;oos&#x2019;. Brief, moderate volume &#x2018;oos&#x2019; are given when alarmed, and longer, low volume &#x2018;oooooos&#x2019;, with a rising tone towards the end are given as contact calls. Nestlings give low volume squeaks to a parent when begging to be fed.</p>\n<p>Similar species: there are no other forest pigeons present on Chatham Island. New Zealand pigeon (kereru) is slightly smaller, does not have the pale contrasting rump of the parea, and the bill is concolourous, without an orange tip. Kereru have not been recorded from the Chatham Islands, but an ancestor of the two species must have flown the 800 km water gap from mainland New Zealand to the Chatham Islands in the past. </p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>While formerly present on Pitt Island, and probably some of the offshore islands too, today the parea is confined to Chatham Island. Most of the population occurs in southern Chatham Island, with a few parea resident in forest patches near the southern and western shoreline of Te Whanga Lagoon, and intermittently in forest patches elsewhere on the island.&#xA0; </p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Parea use three main habitats, native forest, including extensive tracts and small patches, stunted scrub- and bracken-covered areas, and pasture adjacent to forest or shelter-belts. In addition, parea have fed in a <em>Brassica</em> crop planted for stock. </p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The population was estimated at just 45 birds in 1989. As a result of pest control, mainly in the Tuku and Awatotara catchments, since 1989, the population has increased markedly. During a survey in 2009, 263 parea were counted and the population was estimated to number more than 600.&#xA0; </p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The main threat to parea is predation by introduced pests; feral cats, possums, ship rats and weka. Parea forage on the ground in forest and among shrubs and bracken at the forest margin, and so are vulnerable to cat predation. Occasionally pairs nest on the ground or close to it and so eggs, nestlings and incubating or brooding adults are vulnerable to predation by weka, feral pigs and cats. The control of pest populations not only reduces the incidence of predation but also benefits forest regeneration and fruit availability. The fencing of reserves and covenants, excluding feral and farmed stock, has also benefited forest regeneration and so improved habitat quality for parea. The conservation of this species was moved from nationally critical to nationally vulnerable in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Although pairs have been found breeding in all months, parea nest predominantly during winter and spring (June-November). The timing of the nesting season and the proportion of pairs that breed varies between nesting seasons. In seasons when fruit is readily available many pairs rear two chicks (i.e. two separate breeding efforts), often involving overlapping nesting attempts. The nest is a platform of dead twigs, and a single egg is laid. Females incubate from late afternoon until mid-morning, the male during the rest of the day. The chick is brooded constantly until 10-15 days old and well covered with feathers. From then until the chick leaves the nest it is left alone by day, with the occasional brief visit by a parent to feed it. </p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Parea pairs defend territories during the breeding season, roosting conspicuously on the tops of dead trees or an exposed branch in an elevated area (hilltop or ridge crest). During the breeding season a parea will often respond to another flying over its territory by undertaking a display flight. &#xA0;This involves the bird flying up steeply, stalling with wings and tail spread, gliding back to a perch and then standing erect with chest feathers puffed out. Display flights are also given by birds returning to their territories. Not all foraging is undertaken within the territory; individuals or pairs occasionally fly to <em>Dracophyllum</em>-dominated forest, pouteretere bushes in semi-open shrubland or pasture to feed. Stock-grazed areas of pasture close to the forest edge attract parea in the non-breeding season, with a flock of over 100 parea occasionally seen near Taiko Camp adjacent to the Tuku-a-tamatea River. </p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Parea eat mainly leaf buds, leaves, flower buds, flowers and fruit from a variety of species. Fruit seems to be the preferred food type. However, although pairs rearing young ate mainly ripe fruit, they also included flower buds, flowers and leaves in their diet. Abundance of hoho (<em>Pseudopanax chathamicus</em>) fruit, which ripens in winter-spring, has quite an influence on the timing and duration of breeding by parea. When little or no fruit is available, parea feed mainly on leaves. This includes the relatively tough leaves of hoho, which the parea&#x2019;s robust beak (compared to that of the New Zealand pigeon) may have evolved to enable the species to be able to feed on. </p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Pigeon\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Pigeon</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/chatham-island-pigeon-parea/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/chatham-island-pigeon-parea/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chathams.co.nz/index.php/naturalheritage/117-parea-chatham-island-pigeon\">http://www.chathams.co.nz/index.php/naturalheritage/117-parea-chatham-island-pigeon</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dilks, P.J.; Powlesland, R.G.; Adams, L.K.; Flux, I.A. 2010.

It is also critically endangered, and the focus of considerable conservation attention. Before humans arrived it was common throughout New Zealand&#x2019;s forests, but predation by introduced mammals brought it to the brink of extinction - a low point of about 50 birds only in the mid 1990s. The transfer of the whole population to predator-free islands and intensive intervention in every stage of its life has led to a steady increase in numbers.</p>\n<p>Kakapo have no close relatives.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A large flightless forest-dwelling parrot, with a pale owl-like face. Kakapo are moss green mottled with yellow and black above, and similar but more yellow below. The bill is grey, and the legs and feet grey with pale soles.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: males make a deep booming call (&#x201C;booming&#x201D;) and a loud wheezing call (&#x201C;chinging&#x201D;) to attract mates to their leks. Both sexes make a loud high pitched skraak call (&#x201C;skraaking&#x201D;).&#xA0; </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: kaka and kea are the only species with which kakapo might be confused, but their moss green colour, large size, flightlessness and nocturnal habits make them easy to distinguish. It is also very unlikely that any kakapo exist other than at a few managed sites, and so the chances of misidentification are very low.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once found throughout New Zealand, kakapo started declining in range and abundance after the arrival of Maori. They disappeared from the North Island by about 1930, but persisted longer in the wetter parts of the South Island. The last birds died out in Fiordland in the late 1980s. A population of less than two hundred birds was discovered on Stewart Island in 1977, but this population was also declining due to cat predation. During the 1980s and 1990s the entire known population was transferred to Whenua Hou/Codfish Island off the coast of Stewart Island, Maud Island in the Marlborough Sounds and Hauturu/Little Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf. Since then birds have been moved between Whenua Hou, Maud Island and Hauturu, as well as to and from newly predator-free Chalky and Anchor Islands in Fiordland. Kakapo now occur only on forested islands, though they previously appeared to have inhabited a wide range of vegetation types. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A total of 154 birds was known in June 2017. All carry radio transmitters and are intensively monitored and managed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Adult kakapo are vulnerable to predation by cats and stoats, and their eggs and chicks can be killed by rats. Females alone incubate eggs and raise chicks. As they must spend long periods away from the nest feeding, eggs and chicks are particularly vulnerable to predation when the nest is unattended. Chick-rearing is protracted, and nests become smelly and easy for predators to find. Away from nests, kakapo usually freeze and rely on cryptic colouration to hide them from predators. While this strategy worked when the main predators were birds that hunted by sight, it is a completely ineffective strategy to avoid mammalian predators that hunt by smell.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Attempts to protect kakapo from introduced predators by transferring them to Resolution Island in the 1890s failed when stoats swam to the island. In the 1980s and 1990s transfers to completely predator-free Maud Island and to Hauturu and Whenua Hou which only had kiore, halted the kakapo&#x2019;s decline. However, the population did not start to increase until kiore were removed from the islands and the birds were more intensively managed. Intensive management comprised moving the birds between islands, protecting nests from rats, supplementary feeding adults, closely monitoring eggs and chicks, and rescuing and hand-raising any failing chicks. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kakapo have very low genetic diversity and, as a consequence, low fertility. Much recent conservation management has focussed on managing matings, and using artificial insemination to minimise further genetic loss.&#xA0;Kakapo are currently held on three islands (Whenua Hou, Anchor Island and Hauturu);&#xA0;they&#xA0;bred on all three islands in 2016, with 32 chicks surviving.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kakapo breed in summer and autumn, but only in years of good fruit abundance. On islands in southern New Zealand they breed when the rimu trees fruit, which is once every 2 to 4 years. Elsewhere in New Zealand they probably nested when southern beech seeded, but the triggers for breeding in some northern places, including Hauturu, are unknown. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kakapo are lek breeders. Males call from track-and-bowl systems to attract females for mating. Males play no part in incubation or chick-rearing. The nests are on or under the ground in natural cavities or under dense vegetation. The 1-4 eggs are laid in a shallow depression in the soil or rotten wood, which is repeatedly turned-over before and during incubation. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kakapo are nocturnal and solitary, occupying the same home range for many years. They forage on the ground and climb high into trees. They often leap from trees and flap their wings, but at best manage a controlled plummet. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kakapo are entirely vegetarian. Their diet includes, leaves, buds, flowers, fern fronds, bark, roots, rhizomes, bulbs, fruit and seeds. Diet varies seasonally.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Websites </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/\">http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=1492\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=1492</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://nzbirds.com/birds/kakapo.html\">http://nzbirds.com/birds/kakapo.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a title=\"Misson Kakapo Copulation &#x2013; Te Papa Channel\" href=\"http://channel.tepapa.govt.nz/video/mission-kakapo-copulation/\">Mission K&#x101;k&#x101;p&#x14D; Copulation</a>&#xA0;&#x2013; a light-hearted look at the extraordinary efforts that have been made by the Department of Conservation&apos;s K&#x101;k&#x101;p&#x14D; Recovery Team.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Atkinson, I.A.E.; Merton, D.V. 2006.

Much reduced in range and abundance in the North and South islands due to forest clearance and predation by introduced mammals, kaka are most abundant on offshore islands that have no introduced mammals, or at least no stoats. They remain locally common at some sites on the main islands that are close to offshore island refuges, and have increased in abundance at others where mammalian pests have been controlled. Kaka can be found in a wide variety of native forest types including podocarp and beech forest. They are a common sight in Wellington city, having spread from Zealandia / Karori Sanctuary.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A large, olive-brown parrot with grey-white crown, red-orange underwing and deep crimson belly and under-tail coverts. Males have a noticeably longer and deeper upper mandible and bigger head than females but this is generally only apparent when the two sexes are seen side by side.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Voice: a harsh, repeated, rhythmic &#x201C;ka-aa&#x201D; when flying above the forest canopy, harsh grating &#x201C;kraak&#x201D; alarm call when disturbed. Also a variety of loud, musical whistles, but these vary markedly from place to place. Males give a soft &#x201C;tsee-tsee-tsee&#x201D; call during the pre-copulatory display and when showing potential nest sites to females. Females soliciting food from their mates, and juveniles soliciting food from their parents, utter a guttural, repeated &#x201C;aa-aa&#x201D; call.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar species: the only species likely to be confused with the kaka is the kea, which is larger, olive-green rather than olive-brown, and confined to the South Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kaka are rare to uncommon in native forest throughout the three main islands of New Zealand except for areas adjacent to offshore island strongholds such as the Hen and Chicken Islands, Little Barrier Island, Kapiti Island, Ulva Island and Codfish Island. They are also common on Great Barrier and Mayor Islands, and have recovered at some sites where control of mammalian predators is undertaken, such as the Wangapeka valley in Kahurangi National Park, and the Eglinton Valley and Waitutu in Fiordland National Park. Reintroduction programmes have been remarkably successful at a few sites. A large wild kaka flock is a feature at the Pukaha Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre in the Wairarapa, and kaka are commonly seen throughout the Wellington city green belt, following their reintroduction to Zealandia / Karori Sanctuary. Kaka also visit Auckland and Hamilton cities during winter, but there are few sites there where they are regularly seen. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Probably fewer than 10,000 birds. There appears to be sufficient gene flow between most populations to prevent the development of significant genetic differences between them.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although forest clearance has destroyed all but a fraction of the kaka&#x2019;s former habitat, the biggest threat to their survival is introduced mammalian predators, particularly the stoat, but also the brushtail possum. It is predation by these pests, particularly of nesting females, that is the reason for general rarity of kaka on the main islands compared to their forested offshore island strongholds.Kaka can coexist with rats, and possibly also with possums, but not with stoats. Kaka populations can, however, recover when stoats and other pests are controlled by trapping or poisoning.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kaka mainly breed in spring and summer, but occasional second broods can extend breeding into winter. Nests are generally in tree cavities over 5 metres above the ground, but can be at ground level on offshore islands. The nest floor is lined with small wood chips. The typical clutch size is 4. The female alone incubates the eggs and cares for the nestlings but is fed by the male throughout the breeding season. Both parents feed the fledglings which often fledge before they are able to fly, or even climb, effectively.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kaka are obligate forest birds that obtain all their food from trees. They are adept fliers, capable of weaving through trunks and branches, and can cover long distances, including over water. Radio-tracking and banding studies revealed that the kaka of the Hen and Chickens, Little Barrier and Great Barrier Islands are effectively one population, even though these islands are separated by as much as 25 km of open water. Kaka congregate at localised food sources such as flowering rata, but often forage alone for wood-boring insect larvae, fruit or seeds. As conspicuous as they can be when in a group, kaka are typically cryptic when alone, often the only thing to betray their presence is the sound of wood or seed fragments dropped by the bird as it forages. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kaka consume seeds, fruit, nectar, sap, honeydew and tree-dwelling, especially wood-boring, invertebrates. There are also two records of kaka preying on the eggs of small passerines. Kaka are seasonal specialists, moving from food source to food source as different fruits, seeds and nectar become available.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/kaka/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/kaka/</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Kaka\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Kaka</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.kakawatchnz.org/Home.html\">http://www.kakawatchnz.org/Home.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dussex, N.; Sainsbury, J.; Moorhouse, R.; Jamieson, I.G.; Robertson, B.C. 2015.

The possibility that the bones could represent an undescribed species was first raised in the 1990s and the Chatham species was described formerly in 2014. Today one species of kaka survives on mainland New Zealand but until the early 1800s a third species occurred on Norfolk Island, to the north-west of New Zealand. &#xA0;DNA analyses suggest that the Chatham Island parrot originated from a kaka that flew to the island group around 1.7 million years ago.

It is the only truly alpine parrot in the world, and gained early notoriety among settler farmers for attacks on their sheep. Innately curious, kea are attracted to people wherever they enter its mountain domain, and are a feature at South Island ski-fields and mountain huts. Their attraction to people and their paraphernalia is a two-edged sword, providing both new threats and new opportunities.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Identification&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">The kea is a large, strong-flying, olive-green parrot with scarlet underwings and a slender grey-black bill. Sexually dimorphic, female body mass is about 20% less than males and the bill is shorter. Juveniles have yellow ceres and eyelids, which fade to grey as the bird matures.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">The commonest call is a long, loud, high-pitched descending cry which may be broken &#x201C;<em>kee-ee-aa-aa</em>&#x201D;, or unbroken &#x201C;<em>keeeeeaaaa</em>&#x201D;. Many quiet contact calls are given. Juvenile calls are less stable in tone, being more of a loud uncontrolled whooping or squealing. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Kea are unlikely to be confused with other species. Kaka are smaller, olive-brown and very rarely seen above the timberline. They excavate the wood of live trees, whereas keas do not. Kaka have more varied calls, including fluting whistles and harsh grating &#x2018;skraaarks&#x2019;. The extremely rare and localised kakapo is larger, flightless and nocturnal. It is yellow-green rather than olive-green and lacks a scarlet underwing. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Kea range over about four million hectares along the axial ranges of the South Island, from Farewell Spit to Waitutu, plus the Kaikoura Ranges. They can be found from coastal dunes to high alpine peaks, but are most common in montane forests and adjacent subalpine and alpine zones. They are absent from the Marlborough Sounds, Catlins, Blue Mountains and both the North Island and Stewart Island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Kea mainly nest within native forest. Their foraging habitat includes all types of native forest, sub-alpine scrub, tussock and herb-field. They socialise on prominent rocky outcrops and windy saddles above or below the timberline, and are frequently reported in pine forests adjacent to native forest. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Estimating kea population size is difficult due to their extensive range, rugged terrain, low kea density, cryptic behaviour of adults and flocking behaviour of juveniles. With current data, any population estimate is little more than a guess. Density in the upland beech forest of Nelson Lakes National Park in 2011 was approximately one adult female kea per 2,750 hectares, down from about one per 550 ha in 1998. Arthurs Pass National Park holds possibly ten times the density of Nelson Lakes. In a Westland rimu forest the density is roughly one adult female per 500 hectares. A conservative estimate of one adult female per 2000 hectares of forest gives a total population of 4000 adults (males plus females). Productivity estimates predict about one juvenile for every breeding pair, giving a total population of about 6000 birds. Other commonly cited estimates are 15,000 and 1,000-5,000. Both of these seem extreme given recent survey data, with the actual number of kea likely to be between these numbers</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">That the kea persists despite the shooting of 150,000 birds between 1860 and 1970 indicates a high reproductive potential. Fats and proteins scavenged from the carcasses of deer and sheep may have boosted productivity among the reclusive breeding adults. Juveniles were probably disproportionately culled, being more gregarious, conspicuous and inquisitive than adults.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Bounty hunting of kea as a measure to protect sheep was outlawed in 1971, and full protection was finally granted in 1986. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Contemporary threats include introduced mammalian predators, environmental lead, and conflict and accidents with humans and their equipment. Episodic, semi-catastrophic mortality events are thought to be associated with plagues of stoats which ensue after mast seeding of beech and rimu. Ironically, kea are also killed accidentally in possum traps and by poison baits deployed to control predators. Predator control has been associated with substantial increases in nest survival and therefore in recruitment of young birds. The conservation status of this species was changed from naturally uncommon to nationally endangered in 2013.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Kea nest mainly below the tree line, on the ground in natural cavities such as a rock crevice, the hollow base of a large tree, a hollow under the roots of a tree, a hollow log or a dirt cavity under the lip of an old river terrace. The usually 4 eggs are laid July to January (peak laying in August-October). Incubation takes 22-24 days, and chicks stay in the nest for 3 months. The female does all the incubation, brooding and feeding the young by regurgitation. The male brings food to the female, feeding her by regurgitation near the nest site. Fledging peaks in December-February, with an average of 1.6 fledglings per nest </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Normally one clutch is laid per year. An individual female may nest in several successive years, but not all females nest every year. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Kea are monogamous, with long-term pair-bonds. Reports of polygamy were not upheld by radio tracking studies. Juvenile kea congregate in loose, wandering flocks. Breeding adults may join flocks when they pass through their home range. Flexible social hierarchies develop within flocks. Kea are considered highly intelligent compared to other parrots, birds and even mammals. Juveniles are tolerated by unrelated adults and this facilitates learning of complex foraging skills. Juveniles &#x2018;play&#x2019;, and the juvenile period is long compared to other parrots.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Adaptability is a key part of kea ecology. They have benefited from some human-induced modifications to their habitat, including scavenging from dead deer, chamois and tahr shot by hunters, digging for huhu grubs in pine forestry areas, and digging for grass grubs in pasture.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Distinctive behavioural and morphological traits of kea compared to other parrots include the slender bill, digging for food, ground nesting, winter breeding, social dynamics, intelligence, prolonged juvenile phase and use of alpine habitat. This combination of traits indicates an evolutionary history in an unforested habitat. It is likely that these characteristics evolved from a kaka-like ancestor during uplift of the Southern Alps over the last 5 million years. Kea may have an important role in dispersing seeds of alpine plants.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Kea are omnivorous, taking a wide range of plant and animal matter. They forage in trees and scrub for shoots, fruits, leaves, nectar and seeds, dig in the soil for insect larvae and plant tubers (e.g. native orchids), and excavate rotten logs for huhu grubs, especially in rimu forests and logged pine plantations. A few kea prey upon Hutton&#x2019;s shearwater nestlings in the Seaward Kaikoura Range, and throughout their range they scavenge from carcasses of deer, chamois, tahr, and sheep. Some birds perch on sheeps&#x2019; backs and dig through skin and muscle on the rump to reach the fat around the kidneys, which can result in fatal septicaemia. This behaviour is not common, but was the reason why kea were persecuted for over a hundred years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.keaconservation.co.nz/\">www.keaconservation.co.nz</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kea\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kea</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/kea/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/kea/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Anderson, R. 1986.

They are localised in their New Zealand distribution, with most populations on the west coast of the North Island, though flocks also occur on Banks Peninsula and the Catlins in the South Island. Sulphur-crested cockatoos were introduced to New Zealand in the late 19th Century and soon established wild populations. The area over which they occur has increased over time, though their numbers are not great; this species suffering considerable persecution, particularly through live-capture for the pet trade. They are typically found in lowland hill country farmland, with a mixture of exotic and native forest and arable land use. Birds occasionally venture into residential areas. In winter, flocks of hundreds of birds may form to feed on crops, such as maize.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Sulphur-crested cockatoos are large, stocky cockatoos, with short broad wings and a prominent yellow crest. The forward curving crest is normally laid back, but fans out when aroused. Remaining plumage is white, with pale yellow on the underside of the tail and wing. The black beak is robust, capable of breaking into hard seed pods and cones. The eye is dark red-brown. Females are slightly larger than males. Juveniles have a paler eye, and may have some grey in their plumage. Sulphur-crested cockatoos usually occur as pairs or small groups in spring and summer, may form large flocks in autumn and winter.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Voice: the most common call is a harsh screech given in flight, when perched and when alarmed. They also make softer cries, and guttural croaks or barks during conflict.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Similar species: sulphur-crested cockatoos are not easily confused with other New Zealand species, but flocks on the ground or in flight may be confused with cattle egrets from a distance.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Sulphur-crested cockatoos are widespread in northern and eastern Australia where woodland habitat is present. Other subspecies are found throughout New Guinea and the Papuan Islands. Populations have been established outside this range, including Western Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand most populations are on the west coast of the North Island, though some are spreading east into the Bay of Plenty, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and Wairarapa. The largest populations are south of Port Waikato, and the Turakina and Pohangina Valleys. There are also small populations in the Waitakere ranges and at Wainuiomata, and on Banks Peninsula and the Catlins in the South Island. They are wide-ranging and may be seen outside these core areas, though isolated birds may be free-ranging pets or cage-escapes.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Sulphur-crested cockatoos&#xA0;are mainly found in farmland close to native forest or woodland and exotic tree plantations. The largest populations are associated with arable land, especially where maize is grown near to woodland habitat.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Sulphur-crested cockatoos are uncommon and localised. The largest populations, Port Waikato, and Turakina and Pohangina Valleys, contain several hundred birds. Remaining New Zealand populations each contain fewer than 100 birds.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Populations are kept in check by capture for the pet trade. Each year many chicks are taken from nests, and occasionally large numbers of adults are trapped.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Sulphur-crested cockatoos mainly eat the seeds from introduced conifer trees and pasture and crop species, such as grasses and maize. Their impact on agriculture is generally localised, with flocks targeting specific fields of maize on a few properties just after sowing and when mature. Otherwise they are more of a nuisance value for rural communities, feeding on walnuts and damaging ornamental conifers. They may also cause damage to pine plantations, stripping branches when feeding. In native forest their impact is minimal, though they can have a massive impact on individual trees, at times stripping large numbers of branches.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Their potential to impact on native species is minor due to their largely agricultural and ground feeding habit, and the absence of kaka in the fragmented forest patches they occupy.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Sulphur-crested cockatoos are monogamous, forming long-lasting pair bonds. Nest exploration may occur at any time of year, with greatest activity at the nest occurring between July and December. The 1-2 eggs are laid in a nest cavity, which the adults enlarge from naturally occurring holes in trees. The nest is lined with wood chips chiselled from the walls of the nest cavity. Most chicks fledge in late December. Breeding pairs defend the nest hole, though other cockatoos may remain nearby during the nesting period. The relationship of these birds to the breeding pair is unknown. Only part of the population breeds in any one year. The rest of the population forms small nomadic flocks that range over a large area.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Sulphur-crested cockatoos are gregarious. Communal evening roosts in stands of tall trees are used outside the breeding season. Large flocks forage together early in the day, before splitting into smaller flocks for the rest of the day. During autumn and winter, large flocks may form on grassland or crops in the afternoon before retiring to roost. At dusk there is a period of activity, with a lot of calling and flying prior to settling into roost trees. Calling may occur throughout the night.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Cockatoos are not migratory, but there is seasonal variation in use of their home range. In spring and summer they are dispersed over a large area. Winter flocks concentrate their activity in the centre of the occupied area. Birds and flocks can move tens of kilometres per day.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Five species of lice were recovered from sulphur-crested cockatoos shot in the Turakina Valley in 1991.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">Sulphur-crested cockatoos forage on the ground and at all levels of vegetation. The largest flocks occur when foraging on the ground. Smaller groups foraging in trees typically focus on the upper branches. Their diet consists predominantly of seeds, but they may take invertebrates. Important foods are seeds of grass, thistles, maize, macrocarpa and <em>Pinus</em> species.&#xA0; In autumn they spend a lot of time feeding on the fruit of native trees, particularly podocarps, such as kahikatea. The food eaten varies throughout the year, depending on seasonally availability..</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\"><strong>Weblinks&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur-crested_Cockatoo\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur-crested_Cockatoo</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MERWlvl1\" align=\"left\">Higgins, P.J.

A rare vagrant to New Zealand, the lesser sand plover, is easily confused with the banded dotterel when not in breeding plumage. It is a greyer above (cf. brown on banded dotterel) and is whiter on the face, with a white forehead and eye-brow contrasting with a dark eyepatch. Dark shoulder tabs project onto the upper breast, and may join as a dark breast band.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>In the breeding season banded dotterels are widespread on mainland New Zealand from Spirits Bay (Far North) to Mason Bay (Stewart Island), plus some offshore and outlying islands south to Auckland Islands and east to the Chatham Islands. The populations on the Auckland and Chatham Islands have only local movements, whereas mainland birds often undertake migrations of several hundreds of kilometres. The longest banded dotterel migrations are those undertaken by birds of the riverbeds and outwash fans of the South Island high country, most of which have an unusual east-west migration of 1600 km or more to Tasmania and south-eastern mainland Australia for &#x201C;winter&#x201D;, typically in the period late summer to mid winter. Birds that breed in lowland South Island and central New Zealand rivers generally move north to &#x201C;winter&#x201D; at harbours and estuaries of the northern North Island. Others that breed at coastal lagoons and beaches may move only a few kilometres. Vagrant birds regularly reach Norfolk Island, and have also been recorded at the Kermadec Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji. A few Auckland Island banded dotterels have been seen on Campbell Island.</p>\n<p>Typical breeding habitat for banded dotterels comprises lightly vegetated riverbeds, outwash fans, herbfields, beaches and farmland. The composition of vegetation varies regionally and particularly with altitude. For example, high altitude riverbeds are favoured if there is plentiful cover of prostrate shrubs of genera such as <em>Raoulia, Pimelea, Muehlenbeckia </em>and <em>Coprosma</em>, but nearby sites of bare gravels are less often utilised. In lowland sites lightly grassed habitat pasture or even bare gravels may be utilised.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population is in the order of 50,000 birds and is declining. Dotterels have disappeared from many sites throughout New Zealand, including some where the habitat has changed little in recent decades. The key factors in the decline are likely to be introduced mammalian predators which prey on most eggs that are laid and many chicks, juveniles and adults. Invasive predators known to seriously impact on banded dotterels are feral cats, mustelids (ferrets, stoats and weasels), rats and hedgehogs. Habitat loss and human activities has also contributed to displacement of birds at some sites, particularly breeding sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Banded dotterel pairs are solitary and territorial, but there can be high concentrations of birds in good habitat. Birds begin to arrive on the breeding grounds and set up territories in July (later at high altitude). First eggs are laid in August to early November, in shallow scrapes in gravel, sand or soil, usually lined with tiny stones, occasionally shell. The clutch-size nearly always is three eggs, which are coloured grey to pale-green or olive with small dark spots. Incubation is performed by both adults for c.4 weeks and chicks fledge after another 5-6 weeks. Banded dotterels first breed at one year of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Banded dotterels are solitary feeders both during the breeding season and non-breeding season. On the wintering grounds they often defend prime feeding areas on tidal flats and lagoon edges. They often feed at night particularly at estuaries. Like most other harbour waders, banded dotterels will form roosting flocks of sometimes many hundreds of birds. Often the night-time high-tide roosts are in relatively inaccessible sites, e.g. islets, presumably to minimise predation risk by mammals.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Banded dotterels are primarily carnivorous, but also take berries of shrubs such as <em>Muehlenbeckia </em>and<em> Coprosma</em>. Animals eaten are varied and reflect local availability, e.g. crustaceans, worms and flies at many coastal sites. On the breeding grounds the diet is more varied and includes spiders, beetles, insect larvae, adults and subadults of many aquatic insects, e.g. mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies, as well as terrestrial flies.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-banded_Plover\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-banded_Plover</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/bandeddotterel.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/bandeddotterel.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>. 2nd edition.

Some plovers are referred to as &#x2018;dotterels&#x2019;, with the terms used interchangeably for some species, especially in New Zealand. The oriental dotterel (or oriental plover) is one of three migratory plovers that spend the southern summer in large numbers in northern Australia, and for which a few birds occasionally make it across the Tasman Sea to New Zealand. It is a &#x2018;dryland&#x2019; wader, more likely to be found on short grass or saltmarsh than on a mudflat.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The oriental dotterel is a tall, upright elegant plover with comparatively long pale legs. It is usually seen in non-breeding plumage in New Zealand, when it is drab mottled brown above, pale buff-brown on the face and upper breast, and white below. The underwing is dark brown, and there is little or no pale wingbar on the upperwing. In breeding plumage it has a broad chestnut orange breast band with a black bar below across the breast, and the face white &#x2013; in some males almost the whole head is white. Leg colour varies from pale yellow to pink or brown.</p>\n<p>Voice: a soft trill.</p>\n<p>Similar species: in breeding plumage the oriental dotterel is unmistakeable, but in non-breeding plumage it may be confused with New Zealand dotterel and greater and lesser sand plovers. However, the upright stance, long pale legs, dark underwing and lack of a wing bar distinguishes oriental dotterel from all these species.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Oriental dotterels breed across southern Siberia, Mongolia and northeast China, spending the non-breeding season in central Australia. It is a bird of steppe deserts during the breeding season and open grasslands in the non-breeding season. Vagrant birds are likely to be seen on airfield grass or golf courses.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The total population of oriental dotterels is estimated at about 150,000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>There have been about 19 accepted sightings of oriental dotterels in New Zealand since the first sighting of 3 birds in the Kermadec Islands in April 1908. Other than a second record from Raoul Island, Kermadec Island (September 1982), sightings have been spread from Parengarenga Harbour in the north (3 records), south to Invercargill and Waituna Lagoon (February 1988), west to Greymouth (September-October 1982 and October 1987) and east to Chatham Island (November 2000). Most sightings have been of single birds, but there were two on the Manukau Harbour in March 1994, and an exceptional 10 in the Firth of Thames in December 1954 - January 1955. The most recent sightings in New Zealand were one at Port Waikato in September-October 2013, and one at Ohiwa estuary, Bay of Plenty, January-March 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </strong></p>\n<p>Increasing grazing pressure in breeding areas, together with habitat degradation at stopover sites may be adversely affecting the oriental dotterel population.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Very little is known about breeding by oriental dotterels. The nest, eggs and chicks were first described as recently as 2006. The nest is a scrape lined with vegetation and cow dung; clutch of 3 eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The oriental dotterel is a long distance migrant that probably flies between Australia and China non-stop. They frequently run, their long legs giving the impression of the bird &#x2018;cycling&#x2019;.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Oriental dotterels are insectivorous.

On their wintering grounds, wrybills form dense flocks at high-water roosts; the highly-coordinated aerial manoeuvres of these flocks have been described as resembling a flung scarf.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Wrybills are small, pale plovers that are much more approachable than most New Zealand waders. Their underparts are white, with a black upper breast band from mid-winter to the end of the breeding season. The upper parts and sides of the face are pale grey, and the forehead white. The bill is long and black, with the distal third curved 12-26&#xB0; to the right. The legs are dark grey to black. The sexes are alike in eclipse plumage; juveniles lack the black breast band. In breeding plumage, males are distinguishable by a black line above the forehead; this is highly variable however, and difficult to see in some individuals.</p>\n<p>Voice: the most common call is a&#xA0;&apos;chip&apos; that appears to indicate alertness. Rapid &apos;churring&apos; is used when chasing intruding banded dotterels or other wrybills, and very quiet &apos;grating&apos; call used to communicate with chicks. Flocks in flight (and sometimes when milling on the ground) may indulge in excited high-pitched &apos;chattering&apos;.</p>\n<p>Similar species: wrybills are unlikely to be mistaken for other species in breeding plumage or if the bill is seen well. In eclipse plumage the banded dotterel is superficially similar, but has browner upper parts and short straight bill. Confusion is possible with some rare transequatorial migrant waders, notably sanderling and terek sandpiper, but these lack the black breast band, and their bill shapes differ.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>Wrybills breed only in the South Island, east of the main divide. The large majority of the population breeds in Canterbury between the Waimakariri River in the north, and the rivers of the upper Waitaki (Mackenzie) Basin in the south. Main strongholds are the Rakaia, upper Rangitata, and Mackenzie Basin. Four rivers in Otago (Hunter, Makarora, Matukituki, and Dart) and two in North Canterbury (Ashley and Waiau) have small populations. Wrybills previously bred in Marlborough, but their breeding range has contracted southwards over the past 120 years.</p>\n<p>From January to July, wrybills are present in harbours of the northern North Island, mainly Manukau and Firth of Thames, smaller flocks elsewhere. During migration, small flocks are often&#xA0;seen briefly at South Island east coast lakes and estuaries, and flocks may settle at rivermouths in the southwestern North Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Wrybills breed exclusively on braided riverbeds. On their wintering grounds, they feed on inter-tidal mudflats in harbours and estuaries. High-water roosts are usually near foraging areas, commonly on local shellbanks and beaches;&#xA0; occasionally on pasture. In the upper Manukau Harbour, birds regularly roost on roofs of large buildings; occasionally on tarmac at Auckland Airport. On migration, flocks generally follow coastlines, but are not averse to flying overland. A high proportion of the population passes through Lake Ellesmere on both migrations.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Counts on breeding grounds are impractical &#x2013; wrybills are highly cryptic and widely dispersed. Combined counts from wintering flocks suggest a total population of 5000-5500. Counts show high variability (which obscures trends), but the population is thought to be declining slowly.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The main threats faced by wrybills are predation (by introduced mammals and native birds), flooding of nests, and loss or degradation of breeding habitat. Threats vary temporally and spatially, and their relative importance overall is unclear. Actual and potential threats to habitat include loss to hydro-electric power schemes, abstraction of water for irrigation, weed growth, and disturbance caused by a wide range of recreational and commercial activities. On wintering grounds, predation of adults has been recorded, and some loss of roosting habitat is likely as mangroves encroach. Wrybills appear to be prone to collision with man-made objects. Occasional significant strikes have occurred at Auckland Airport, and collisions with fencelines and powerlines have been recorded.</p>\n<p>A small proportion of the population is managed through predator control programmes. The largest such area covers the whole Tasman River catchment, but benefits are equivocal to date. A few small areas are managed by community groups (e.g. the lower Ashley River).</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Wrybills breed in monogamous dispersed pairs. Territories may overlap with those of other species (e.g. banded dotterel, black-fronted tern, pied stilt), but are vigorously defended against other wrybills. The nest is a shallow scrape in the gravel, lined with many small stones. The normal clutch is 2; first clutches are laid in September or October. Replacement clutches laid after loss may occur through to January. Some pairs&#xA0;will double-brood if they are successful early. Incubation is shared and is protracted; accurate data are few, but values from 30-36 days recorded. Chicks fledge after 35-40 days; chicks are guarded by one or both parents during their first 3 weeks at least, often becoming increasingly independent before fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Wrybills usually allow a close approach. When incubating, they rely on camouflage to avoid detection, and flush from the nest very late. Distraction displays are used to defend nests; banded dotterels are aggressively chased if close to eggs or chicks. Chicks freeze to escape detection (especially when small), and swim well from a few days old. Away from the breeding grounds, wrybills are highly gregarious and form dense flocks, normally also very approachable.</p>\n<p>Northward migration typically begins in late December, and peaks in January. Southward migration is mainly in August and early September (adults), with some first-year birds (which will not breed) following in October-November.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>On the breeding grounds, wrybills consume a wide range of aquatic invertebrates, but predominantly mayfly and caddisfly larvae. On wintering grounds, a range of small marine and littoral invertebrates are taken (including annelid and polychaete worms, small molluscs, and insects), and the occasional small fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrybill\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrybill</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/wrybill.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/wrybill.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Davies, S.J. 1997.

In adults, prominent black bands on the breast and head contrast sharply with the otherwise white plumage. Young birds have a mostly white breast, the black bands developing with adulthood. It occurs mostly in small numbers in east coast North and South Island localities, also in the Manawatu. They are found on or beside inland or coastal waterways (but not the coast itself), estuaries, farm ponds, lagoons, on stony river beds and at sewerage sedimentation ponds, but not on coastlines. The plumage colouration provides good camouflage when on shingle sites and stony riverbeds. Black-fronted dotterels are smaller and more slightly built than banded dotterels.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted dotterels are smaller and more dainty than banded dotterels and are recognisable by the striking Y-shaped black plumage on the chest contrasting with white plumage above and below, and a conspicuous black stripe through the eye that extends back to the hind neck. The crown is streaked light brown. The plumage below the eye stripe and bill and on the lower foreneck and remaining undersides is white. The back and lower wings are streaked buff to light-brown. There is a wide whitish bar on the inner upperwing; the rest of the inner wing is dark-brown mottled with white and grey. The outer upperwing is dark brown to black. The underwing is mainly white, with blackish flight feathers forming a broad dark trailing edge. The bill is red with a black tip, the eye-ring is red, and the legs are pinkish to light red. The sexes are similar with no seasonal variation in plumage. Juveniles have a mostly white chest. Black-fronted dotterels are usually solitary or in pairs or in small groups. They tend to run in short bursts but walk slowly when feeding. In flight they have a jerky, lapwing-like wing action and reveal their bold wing markings.</p>\n<p>Voice: a faint high-pitched sharp note like a <em>peeep</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: black-fronted dotterels are smaller and slimmer with quite different facial, breast and wing markings. Rare vagrant red-kneed dotterel (recorded once in New Zealand) is larger with longer legs, has a solid black cap extending well below the eye, and has a broad white trailing edge to the wing (both upper and lower).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted dotterels are mainly found in lowland eastern regions from Auckland to Southland, especially in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, Wairarapa,&#xA0;Canterbury and Otago; also in the Manawatu and at Tokaanu (Lake Taupo). They colonised New Zealand from Australia from the 1950s, with early records from Hawke&#x2019;s Bay (1954), Manawatu (1955) and North Canterbury (1956). The first nest was found in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay in 1962, and at least 109 birds were present there in 1962. Breeding was first reported in the South Island in 1970, on the Opihi River, South Canterbury. By 2016 they were known to be breeding on&#xA0;the Wairau, Awatere, Hurunui, Ashburton, Orari&#xA0;and Opihi&#xA0;Rivers, as well as at numerous sites in the lower North Island.</p>\n<p>Black-fronted dotterels are mainly found at fresh water or brackish estuaries, on gravel riverbeds, and the muddy edges of inland and coastal lakes and ponds, including sewerage ponds. They are rarely seen on coasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted dotterels are uncommon in New Zealand but may be increasing slowly. The current population is probably fewer than 3,000 birds. They occur mostly in small numbers (1 to 4 birds together is typical), but favoured wintering sites can have up to 50 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand range of the black-fronted dotterel has expanded considerably since the 1960s and is probably still expanding, including in western localities. The main threat to adults and young is during breeding. Nests and chicks are vulnerable especially where nests are placed close to roads, tracks or livestock, or are at risk from predators, including cats and stoats. Some losses on riverbeds are caused by flooding where nests are close to watercourses.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The black-fronted dotterel is a solitary nesting species, between August and March, peaking between September and December. Nests are in open ground, fields, gravel pits, river beds, stony or shingle land, not far from fresh water. The nest is usually a depression in the ground and is mostly unlined or is surrounded by a few twigs, stones or grass. Both sexes share in incubation of the 2-3 eggs, which are pale white or yellowish with dark spots or lines. Incubation takes 22-26 days. Young are speckled dark grey-and-white and are well camouflaged. Adults shade the young on hot days, and perform distraction displays when alarmed. Second and third clutches are common after the first brood has fledged, and may commence even before fledging of an earlier brood has occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted dotterel are generally not gregarious, with birds&#xA0;usually seen singly, in pairs or groups of up to 4-5 birds. After breeding most birds stay on rivers, but some form flocks at lagoons, lakes, estuaries and sewage ponds in winter. They have cryptic colouration when on shingle or stony substrate. Birds feed throughout the day at the water&#x2019;s edge of slow moving streams, rivers, estuaries or at still ponds. When&#xA0;a bird walks&#xA0;the body is often held in a nearly horizontal posture. Flights are mostly short. Birds tend to run for short periods, then stop and walk when feeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Black-fronted dotterels consume small invertebrates including insects, small earthworms, snails, crustaceans, spiders and mites. Seeds form a small part of diet, including clover and small grasses. Food is mostly found on damp ground by walking, running, stopping and bobbing and pecking at the water&#x2019;s edge, often retracing the area that has been worked over.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3152\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3152</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-fronted_Dotterel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-fronted_Dotterel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/bfdotterel.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/bfdotterel.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://10000birds.com/black-fronted-dotterels.htm\">http://10000birds.com/black-fronted-dotterels.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Andrew, I.G. 1956. <a href=\"http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/black-fronted-dotterel-c-melanops-near-palmerston-north\">Black-fronted dotterel (<em>C. melanops</em>) near Palmerston North</a>. <em>Notornis 6</em>: 185.</p>\n<p>Brathwaite, D.H. 1955. <a href=\"http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/waders-ahuriri-lagoon-napier\">Waders on Ahuriri Lagoon, Napier</a>. <em>Notornis 6</em>: 145-150.</p>\n<p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>. 2nd edition.

It is one of the world&#x2019;s rarest shorebirds, with a global population in early 2016 of about 175 adults (including about&#xA0;70 breeding pairs). Intensive management has gradually reduced the risk of extinction; birds now breed at four sites in the wild, but have proved very vulnerable to predator incursions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The shore plover&#x2019;s only congener is the hooded plover <em>T. rubricollis</em> of Australia. Another species described as <em>T. rossii</em> from the Auckland Islands in the 19th century is generally believed to be a juvenile <em>T. novaeseelandiae</em>, with collection locality recorded incorrectly.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The shore plover is a small stocky plover, mainly mid-brown above and white below. It has a distinctive black (male) or dark-brown (female) face mask that extends down to cover the neck and throat. A white strip circles the head above the eye. The crown and remaining upperparts are grey-brown mottled with darker brown, and the underparts are white. A broad white wingbar shows in flight. The bill is relatively long and pointed, orange at the base and with a dark tip; the orange more extensive (and usually brighter) in males. The eye-ring is orange-red and the legs orange. Juveniles are mid-brown above and white below, lack the face mask (although often have a darker smudge around the eye), and have a white forehead and eye-stripe. The dark face mask typically becomes apparent from about 6 months. The bill of juveniles is mainly dark with only a small area of dull orange at the base.</p>\n<p>Voice: the common territorial call is a loud, rapid ringing, somewhat reminiscent of a miniature oystercatcher piping. Contact call between members of a pair is a soft &#x2018;chip&#x2019;. Chicks make a high-pitched and repeated squeaking when in danger, louder and more strident as they get older.</p>\n<p>Similar species: adults are unlikely to be mistaken for other species, although it has been suggested that some early records confused turnstones with shore plover. Juveniles could be confused with eclipse or juvenile banded dotterel, but the bill of the shore plover&#xA0;is noticeably longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Shore plovers were previously found around the coast of mainland New Zealand, but were extirpated by about the 1870s. They have been confined to the Chatham Islands since then, where&#xA0;their range continued to shrink as predators spread. By about 1900, they were believed confined to a single population on Rangatira (South East) Island. In 1999 however, a small population was discovered on Western Reef, off Chatham Island; that population declined rapidly, and the last bird was taken into captivity in 2003. Stragglers regularly reach Pitt Island, and a small population has been re-established on Mangere Island.</p>\n<p>During the past 20 years, captive-bred birds have been released on islands around mainland New Zealand (see below); birds from these releases often wander to nearby mainland areas.</p>\n<p>On Rangatira, shore plover forage mainly on the rock platforms that surround much of the island. Most nests are among vegetation and/or boulders at the back of these platforms. Some birds breed on The Clears, an elevated salt-meadow, and some previously bred inland on short pasture when the island was grazed. Birds released on other islands have used a wide range of habitat types, including sandy beaches, papa platform, rocky shorelines, shingle beaches, and tidal estuaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Until the 1990s, the shore plover population consisted of about 50 breeding pairs, with a total post-breeding population averaging about 150 individuals. Following translocations, this rose to about 94 pairs in the wild by 2010. However, following predator incursions at two sites, the total wild population had fallen to about 60-65 pairs by early 2013. The captive population contains 6-10 pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Shore plover are very susceptible to any introduced mammalian predators larger than mice. Captive-bred juveniles released on islands are also susceptible to native avian predators (mainly southern black-backed gull, swamp harrier, and morepork). The species was clearly at high risk of extinction while only one self-sustaining population existed. Extensive conservation efforts have aimed at founding additional populations over the past 20+ years. A captive population was founded on the New Zealand mainland in the 1990s using eggs from Rangatira Island; over 500 captive-bred juveniles have since been released on predator-free islands around the New Zealand mainland. Breeding populations&#xA0;were established on two islands (Waikawa/Portland and Mana Islands), but both had numbers severely reduced by rat incursions, and the Mana population was eventually extirpated. A small population has recently been established on Motutapu Island in the Hauraki Gulf (4 pairs breeding in 2015/16). In the Chatham Islands, a small breeding population was established in the early 2000s on Mangere Island by transferring wild-bred juveniles from Rangatira Island. The global population is still very small and vulnerable, and continuing conservation efforts are essential.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Shore plover breed in monogamous pairs, defending territories vigorously against conspecifics. They almost always nest under cover of vegetation, boulders, or driftwood. The normal clutch is 3; most first clutches are laid in October, with replacement clutches laid after loss through to January. Daytime incubation is shared but mainly by the female; the male takes the night shift. Incubation takes about 28 days. The fledging period is variable (29-63 days), probably depending on food availability; typically 35-45 days. Double-brooding has not been recorded on Rangatira Island, but has occurred at release sites around the mainland.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Shore plover normally allow a close approach. They are very territorial while breeding, but may form post-breeding flocks that feed and roost together during autumn and winter. Juveniles often disperse widely, but commonly return to the natal area to breed. On Rangatira Island they usually first breed at 2 or 3 years. In newly-established populations and in captivity, a few breed at 1 and most at 2. Once established on a territory, site and mate fidelity are high.</p>\n<p>Releases around mainland New Zealand have shown that shore plover are strong fliers &#x2013; one released on Mana Island was seen at Plimmerton on the nearby mainland, then Lake Ellesmere, then Manawatu Estuary before returning to Plimmerton; minimum distance 850 km in two months. Several birds have returned from release sites to captive institutions where they were reared, 250-385 km.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Shore plover consume a wide range of small littoral and terrestrial invertebrates, and occasionally small fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3145\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3145</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/shoreplover.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/shoreplover.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nationalredlist.org/files/2012/09/NZ-shore-plover.pdf\">http://www.nationalredlist.org/files/2012/09/NZ-shore-plover.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Davis, A. 1994.

The back, wings and tail are brown, with contrasting white feathering in front of the wings. The upper flanks have a chestnut patch, often obscured by the wings. The belly and undertail white. In flight, its brown wings have a broad white trailing edge on the tips of the secondaries and inner primaries. The bill is red with a black tip. The legs are long; pink to just below the &#x201C;knee&#x201D; and then grey. The sexes are alike. Juveniles have grey-brown on the head and nape, the breast band is absent or smudgy, and the chestnut flank patch is initially absent.

In just over 80 years since the first breeding record, it has gone from a fully protected native to having that protection removed in 2010. First recorded breeding near Invercargill in 1932, it subsequently spread northwards through the country, becoming established in Northland in the 1980s. A bird of open country, it is an obtrusive, noisy addition to habitats ranging from riverbeds and sea and lakeshores to agricultural pasture and urban parklands. Common names for birds can be a linguistic minefield, but our spur-winged plover should not to be confused with a species of the same name that occurs in central Africa. Given that it is actually a lapwing, perhaps it would have been easier if we had adopted its Australian name - masked lapwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The spur-winged plover is a large stocky wader with pronounced yellow bill and wattles, and yellow eye ring. Black on the crown and hind neck becomes a black collar extending to sides of the breast. The rest of the head, neck and under parts are white, the mantle, back and coverts are uniform light grey-brown contrasting with a white rump. The black tail has a white base and thin white tip. The long legs are reddish brown. A long yellow spur protruding from the carpal area of each wing gives the species its name. The flight pattern of the spur-winged plover - shallow beats of broad rounded wings - is unlike any other New Zealand wader.</p>\n<p>Voice: a shrill staccato rattle &#x2013; often heard at night.</p>\n<p>Similar species: none</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Spur-winged plovers are now widespread in a wide range of open habitats throughout New Zealand. They may be found in almost any area with low vegetation, often near water: from the margins of marine and terrestrial wetlands, riverbeds and lake shores to estuaries and beaches, to farm pastures and almost any grassland in urban areas, playing fields, parks or even road verges. Spur-winged plovers are resident on the Chatham Islands, and vagrant birds have been recorded from the Kermadec, Bounty, Snares, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The spur-winged plover is abundant. A 1994 estimate of c.3,600 was based on birds counted at harbours and estuaries, and was a gross underestimate of a species that occurs widely in many different habitats</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Fully protected since 1946, a growing number of complaints about spur-winged plovers from a broad spectrum of the community &#x2013; private individuals, regional councils, conservation organisations, and hunting interests &#x2013; led to that status being removed in 2010. They join southern black-backed gulls as the only native species without some level of legal protection. The horticultural industry and market gardeners complained of crop damage, particularly to green-leafed vegetables such as cauliflower, broccoli and lettuce. Others believed them to be causing problems for other native species; for example, there is video footage of a spur-winged plover destroying a New Zealand dotterel egg, and also limited reports of them attacking other native birds. However, according to a Department of Conservation discussion document, &#x2018;while they are aggressive and may displace other indigenous species from habitats, their overall impact on other native species are considered not significant.&#x2019;&#xA0;The bulk of concerns related to &#x2018;interactions&#x2019; with aircraft. Of the 1406 incidents of bird strikes (or near misses) reported to the Civil Aviation Authority from October 1999 to September 2004 where the species was identified,&#xA0;37 per cent were spur-winged plovers. There also appeared to be an upward trend in the number of incidents as the species continued its expansion through the country. The proportion of incidents where spur-winged plover were involved was 8 per cent in 1988, 11 per cent in 1989, 14 per cent in 1990 and 22 per cent in 1991. Nearly half of reported incidents were strikes.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Spur-winged plovers breed as isolated pairs, and are monogamous with shared incubation and chick care. They nest in a wide range of open habitats such as wetland edges and saltmarsh, but most commonly occur in areas associated with human activities, including pasture and cropland, urban parks and golf courses and even the roofs of buildings. (One pair nested on an office building roof in the inner Auckland suburb of Newmarket.) Most nests are a simple scrape that may be lined with various nearby materials &#x2013;including dried grass or twigs, small pebbles and sheep droppings. The 3-4 eggs are olive-yellow, -brown or -green with irregular dark brown or purple spots and blotches. Laying is usually June to November. Incubation takes 30-34 days, with precocial chicks leaving the nest almost immediately after hatching, fledging at 6-7 weeks and independent after 8-9 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>This very successful recent coloniser is now a highly visible and often loud presence in open areas throughout the country. Their success is clearly linked to human modifications of the landscape, especially from agricultural and urban development. Their loud staccato cry, often in response to disturbance, is unmistakable. They are vigorous defenders of their territories, and are commonly seen mobbing swamp harriers.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Spur-winged plovers take a wide range of marine and terrestrial invertebrates including molluscs, crustaceans, insects, and worms.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Lapwing\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Lapwing</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Anon. 2006.

They were introduced in small numbers from Britain between 1871 and 1880. Cirl buntings are largely birds of low rainfall areas, found mainly in farmland habitats with patches of scrub, hedgerows and scattered trees. The males are an attractive and boldly marked bird, whilst the females are comparatively drab and streaked. They feed on a diet of seeds and a wide variety of insects. They are &#xA0;territorial and mostly sedentary, and do not associate a great deal with other bird species, except at a good food source.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Cirl buntings are roughly the size of a house sparrow. Males have a distinctive facial pattern: a black line runs through the eye, with yellow lines above and below it; there is a black bib on the throat with a yellow band beneath it. An olive-green band runs across the upper chest. In winter the plumage is duller due to the presence of buff tips which wear off by spring. Females and juveniles are brownish and streaked, with diagnostic pale horse-shoe shaped markings on the ear-coverts.</p>\n<p>Voice: the male has a rattling song similar to part of a greenfinch song, repeated up to nine times per minute. A high-pitched contact call is uttered frequently between birds in pairs or small flocks, except while feeding. A loud chattering call is used during territorial disputes.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the closely related yellowhammer is superficially similar, but both sexes show more yellow colouration, especially on the head. The rump is chestnut in both sexes, compared with olive-green in the cirl bunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Cirl buntings are mainly found in low-rainfall regions of the eastern South Island<strong>.</strong> They require dry summers in order to breed successfully. Cirl buntings are widespread from the Marlborough Sounds south to Kaikoura, being most common in parts of the Awatere Valley. They are present at scattered sites in Canterbury, from Waiau south to Timaru. There are widespread records from coastal North Otago and Central Otago. Cirl buntings are also present in the Nelson region, with records from coastal Golden Bay and Motueka as well as from a number of sites closer to Nelson. Vagrants have been reported from Southland and the West Coast. In the North Island, cirl buntings are known to have been breeding regularly at two sites in Wellington since 1991. There are scattered records from Northland, Auckland, Gisborne, Hawke&#x2019;s Bay, Manawatu and Wairarapa. Single birds or small flocks have been recorded from Stephens, Mana,&#xA0;Motuora and Waiheke Islands.</p>\n<p>The natural range of the cirl bunting extends from south-west Britain south to the Mediterranean Sea and east to Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey; also North Africa.</p>\n<p>Cirl buntings have restricted habitat preferences compared to other songbirds introduced and established in New Zealand. They prefer dry open pastoral country with patches of scrub, scattered trees and hedgerows, where the grass is kept relatively short by the grazing of livestock. Cirl buntings have a particular liking for the lower slopes of hills, gullies in rolling country and river terraces with the above vegetation types.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Cirl buntings are rare or absent from most of New Zealand, but are fairly common at a few favoured localities in the South Island. The total New Zealand population has been estimated at 2000 - 5000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>There are no reported economic or ecological impacts from this species; nor are any likely, as the population size is small.</p>\n<p>Due to their narrow range of habitat preferences, changes in land use may have a detrimental impact on cirl buntings. There has been a proliferation of vineyards in one of the more favoured localities in New Zealand - the Awatere Valley. This may have caused a substantial decline in the population of cirl buntings there, due to the loss of habitat. The conversion of rural land to residential uses on the outskirts of Christchurch has likewise been linked to a decline there. The removal of livestock from farmland can also impact this species negatively, as they prefer close-cropped sward for foraging.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Male cirl buntings establish territories in late September and sing to attract a mate. These territories are relatively large; 12 were counted on a 500 ha farm in Marlborough. A loose nest sited in dense vegetation is built by the female, and is lined with fine fibres. 2-4 (typically 3) eggs are laid. Both parents feed the chicks. After fledging, the female is likely to nest again while the male attends the chicks from the first nest.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Cirl buntings spend much of their time close to cover, feeding mainly on the ground. However, males frequently sing from prominent positions on the top of trees, bushes, fences, large rocks or power lines. They are inconspicuous, but can often be approached closely. Cirl buntings may join flocks of other species briefly when they feed in or near their territories. They are highly territorial during the breeding season, during which time this aggression may occasionally extend to territorial disputes with yellowhammers. Cirl buntings are largely sedentary; most birds remain in the vicinity of their territories throughout the year. Records from the Wellington south coast indicate that some birds cross Cook Strait.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Cirl buntings feed mainly on invertebrates and seeds, mostly collected from the ground. Chicks are fed on a variety of invertebrates, of which grasshoppers seem to be particularly favoured. Also eaten are cicadas, beetles, moths, caterpillars, aphids, flies and spiders. The seed component of the diet is mainly a variety of grass seeds. Ryegrass is a particular favourite, but barley grass and <em>Poa annua </em>are also commonly eaten. Other seeds which may be eaten occasionally are dandelion, wireweed, <em>Amaranthus</em>, fat-hen and chickweed.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">http</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">://</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">www</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">.</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">nzbirds</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">.</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">com</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">/</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">birds</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">/</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">cirlbunting</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">.</a><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/cirlbunting.html\">html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">http</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">://</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">en</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">.</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">wikipedia</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">.</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">org</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">/</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">wiki</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">/</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">Cirl</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">_</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirl_Bunting\">Bunting</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.

The Australian reed warbler was split about from the very similar clamorous reed warbler (<em>Acrocephalus stentoreus</em>) in the late 1990s, though this split is not universally accepted. It is a typical large <em>Acrocephalus</em> warbler, which as a group have&#xA0;plumage of various shades of brown and beige, a pale eyebrow and a dark stripe through the eye. The Australian reed warbler is the only member of the <em>Acrocephalus</em> genus recorded in New Zealand.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Australian reed warbler is medium-sized songbird that is plain mid olive-brown above and pale beige below, with a pale beige eyebrow and a faint brown stripe through the eye. The bill is thrush-like in structure and dark brown above paler below; the legs are very dark grey/brown.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Song: a varied outpouring of a mixture of guttural and liquid notes with some phrases repeated, e.g.&#xA0;<em>chug chug cherty cherty cherty swee chug chug</em> etc., a little like an improvising jazz musician. Calls&#xA0;include an&#xA0;unmusical &#x2018;tick&#x2019; and scolding notes.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Similar species: there are several <em>Acrocephalus</em> warblers in the Australasian/Pacific region, including the migratory oriental reed warbler (<em>A. orientalis</em>), which is a rare visitor to northern Australia. This species has darker brown streaks on the upper breast/throat, darker lores and a shorter beak. Its song is deeper-pitched, more mechanical and lacks the sweeter phrases of Australian reed warbler. Fernbirds inhabit the same wetland vegetation types that reed warblers may occur in, but are darker, more streaked and much less vocal. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Australian reed warblers of several races are found in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, the Philippines,&#xA0;and&#xA0;islands near and within these countries.

They have disappeared from large areas of New Zealand, including Wairarapa, Wellington and Canterbury, but remain common on the West Coast and in pockets of suitable habitat from Northland to Stewart Island. Fernbirds occupy drier shrubland and tussock habitat at a few sites, including in the Far North and on some islands.</p>\n<p>Fernbirds are closely related to the grassbirds <em>Megalurus</em> of Australia and Africa, and are sometimes included in that genus.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Small, long-tailed songbirds that are predominantly streaked brown above and pale below. The mainland subspecies have a chestnut cap and a prominent pale superciliary stripe. The loosely-barbed plain brown tail feathers have a distinctive tattered appearance.</p>\n<p>Voice: a characteristic &#x2018;u-tick&#x2019; given as a duet by members of a pair.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the only other skulking passerine found in dense vegetation is the introduced dunnock, which is smaller, and has darker underparts and a shorter tail.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat </strong></p>\n<p>Widely if patchily distributed in dense wetland vegetation throughout New Zealand; absent from the southern North Island (apart from Waikanae Estuary) and Canterbury. Locally common in dry shrubland near North Cape, tussock-covered frost flats up to 1000 m altitude in Tongariro and Kahurangi National Parks, pakihi vegetation on the West Coast, and reedbeds growing in saltmarshes in the West Coast, Otago and Southland. Occurs in dense kiekie on the Open Bay Islands (off Haast), and in tussock grassland and under low tree-daisy (<em>Olearia</em>) forest and kokomuka (<em>Hebe elliptica</em>) shrubland on muttonbird islands and the Snares Islands. Common on Great Barrier Island, formerly present on Great King Island (Three Kings Islands) and Aldermen Islands, introduced to Tiritiri Matangi Island; otherwise absent from islands off North Island, in Marlborough Sounds and in Fiordland.</p>\n<p><strong>Population </strong></p>\n<p>Locally common in suitable habitat; few population estimates. About 1500 pairs estimated on Snares Islands (8 pairs/ha); 2.4 pairs/ha near Whangarei; 3 birds/ha at Tiropahi, West Coast; 1.89 birds per 5-min count on Great Barrier Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>Many local populations have been lost due to drainage of wetlands and conversion to pasture, combined with predation by introduced mammals. Several populations on muttonbird islands were extirpated by introduced ship rats (Solomon, Pukeweka and Big South Cape Islands) and weka (Kundy and Jacky Lee Islands).</p>\n<p>Fernbirds died out on Great King and Aldermen Islands, probably due to vegetation succession. A few island populations have been established or re-established by translocation, e.g. North Island fernbirds to Tiritiri Matangi Island, Stewart Island fernbirds to Kundy Island, and Codfish Island fernbirds to Putauhinu Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding </strong></p>\n<p>Spring and summer breeding. A deep, woven, feather-lined cup of fine grass or sedge leaves in dense vegetation, usually less than 1 metre above ground or water. Clutch size typically 2 on islands and 3-4 on mainland. Both members of the pair incubate the eggs and care for the young.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology </strong></p>\n<p>Fernbirds are poor fliers; they typically scramble through dense vegetation, though occasionally fly short distances with their tail hanging down, just above the vegetation. Although difficult to observe due to the dense habitat they occupy, fernbirds often approach observers closely, especially in response to mimicked calls. Pairs keep in contact with duet calls. On southern islands, fernbirds forage frequently among leaf litter, holding up leaves with one foot while inspecting the underside, and they occasionally enter seabird burrows. They also catch blowflies on sleeping sea lions (Snares Islands). Fernbirds have a gamey smell which makes them irresistible to dogs trained for game hunting or as conservation dogs. Oldest known bird 6.5 years. No banded birds have moved more than 800 m, but fernbirds occasionally turn up at sites tens of kilometres from known populations.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Insects (especially caterpillars, flies, beetles and moths), spiders and other small invertebrates.

The first bird described was killed in 1868 by &#x201C;knocking it over with a stone&#x201D;. A total of only 44 skinned specimens or specimens preserved in spirits have been located in the world&#x2019;s museums. However the species has been found in fossil deposits on other Chatham Islands. Only scant information was recorded about the fernbird&#x2019;s behaviour. Unlike the Chatham Island species, all other forms of fernbird have survived.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island fernbirds were rufous above and white below, lacking the underside speckling found in most other fernbirds. The specific name <em>rufescens</em> refers to the reddish dorsal plumage. Like other fernbirds, the Chatham species had a distinctive long tail that was often frayed due to wear. Its legs and feet were more robust than those of its mainland counterparts, yet its wings were relatively smaller, so it must have had a reduced ability to fly. Some partly white birds were reported. The species had the &#x201C;typical&#x201D; fernbird call but also a &#x201C;peculiar whistle, very like that which a man would use in order to attract the attention of another at some distance&#x201D; (Travers &amp; Travers 1873).</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Historic reports record the species only from Mangere Island. However fossils tell a different story, as numerous bones have been found on both Pitt Island and on main Chatham Island, so the species was formerly widespread in the island archipelago.</p>\n<p>Chatham Island fernbirds were recorded as hopping rapidly from one point of concealment to another and &#x201C;flitting about among the grass and stunted vegetation&#x201D; (Buller 1869, Travers &amp; Travers 1873).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>In 1871-72 the species was not uncommon on Mangere Island. The relative abundance of fossils on Pitt and main Chatham Islands suggests that it may once have been a common bird throughout the archipelago.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The species was probably wiped out on main Chatham Island by the Pacific rats which arrived with the first Polynesian settlers, and/or by cats. Cats are presumed to have caused the fernbird&#x2019;s extinction in the 19th century on the smaller rat-free islands in the group. On its final stronghold of Mangere Island, the last specimens were collected in January 1895, shortly after cats were released there to control rabbits.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Chatham Island fernbirds foraged for insects on the ground. The pelvis and legs were highly specialised for moving aside vegetation and litter while foraging for prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Fernbird\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Fernbird</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bartle, J.A.; Tennyson, A.J.D. 2009.

It is found throughout New Zealand and its offshore and outlying islands, occurring in most vegetated habitats, including suburban gardens, farmland, orchards, woodlands and forests. Silvereyes are small songbirds that are easily recognised by their conspicuous white eye-ring; their plumage is mainly olive-green above and cream below. It is an active, mobile species that moves about frequently, including making sea crossings.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The silvereye is a common small songbird immediately recognisable by its distinctive white eye-ring. It has olive-green plumage on the head, lower back and upper tail, and mid-grey on the hindneck, sides of neck and upper back. The upper wings are mostly dark olive green, with narrow lines of yellowish green, and the tail is dark olive green. The underparts are whitish-cream on the throat and upper breast, creamy grey on the belly and undertail, the flanks are pinkish-buff, the thighs are white, and the underside of the wings creamy-white. The dark brownish-black bill is fine, short and sharply pointed. The iris is dark reddish-brown, and the legs and feet pale brown. The sexes are alike. Juveniles have similar colouring to adults but have a narrower and duller white eye-ring.</p>\n<p>Voice: a range of clear often high-pitched and melodious calls including warbles, and trills, often repeated, used in a wide variety of contexts. The main contact is a plaintive <em>creee</em>, and the flight call a shorter <em>cli-cli</em>, with many birds calling at once. Full song is a quiet, long liquid warble, similar to the song of the dunnock.</p>\n<p>Similar species: bellbird is of similar build but twice the size, lacks the white-eye ring and is olive-green on underparts as well as upperparts.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Silvereyes occur throughout New Zealand from sea level up to about 1,200 m altitude, in urban areas, farmlands, orchards and all indigenous and exotic forests and scrublands, including scrubby edges of wetlands. They are less common in open grassland areas of Otago. Silvereyes are resident on Stewart, Great Barrier, Kermadec, Chatham, Snares, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands. Although silvereyes are resident on or regularly visit all vegetated offshore islands, they are only irregularly or seasonally present on islands with high-densities of bellbirds and other passerines, including Three Kings, Poor Knights, Little Barrier and Kapiti Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Silvereyes are common and widespread, often in large flocks in winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Silvereyes damage ripening fruit in orchards, including grapes, apricots, cherries and apples. Vineyards are often covered to protect ripening grapes from bird damage, including from silvereyes. On the positive side of the ledger, silvereyes eat aphids (hence the alternative name &#x2018;blight bird&#x2019;), and are a major predator of overwintering codling moth caterpillars. They may spread weed seeds through ingestion of small fruits and they are known to spread seeds of native trees and shrubs, including kahikatea and coprosmas. Silvereyes assist with pollination of some tree species such as kowhai and fuchsia when feeding on nectar. They have no recognised impacts on native bird species.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Pairs are monogamous and territorial when breeding, nesting between August-September and February, peaking in September &#x2013; November in most localities. Nests are in the outermost branches of trees, shrubs and treeferns, mostly more than 8 metres above the ground, and are a well-built, delicate cup woven into small branches and comprising moss, lichen, small fine twigs, hair, spider web and thistledown. One or both sexes build nests. Two or three clutches may be raised during a season, with 2-5 eggs per clutch. Eggs are pale blue and laid at 24 hour intervals. Incubation is shared by the sexes and takes 10-12 days. Young are blind and naked when hatched apart from two tiny tufts of down on the head. Their eyes open after 4 days, they are well-feathered 10 days after hatching, and fledge at 9-11 days-old. Both sexes feed fledglings.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>A gregarious species, silvereyes are well known for flocking especially in winter. They are a mobile species that forages actively for food in parklands, woodlands, suburban gardens, forests and scrublands. Aggressive interactions are common within flocks, with a dominant bird performing rapid wing fluttering and short aggressive chases of other birds. Some local seasonal movement and even migration within the country may occur; for example, a bird banded in Marlborough&#xA0;was recovered in Wellington.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Silvereyes are omnivorous and eat a range of small insects such as aphids, caterpillars and flies, also spiders, gleaned from shrubs and trees. They also feed on a range of small and large fruits including small berries and ripening fruit including grapes, cherries, apples, pears, figs, apricots and peaches. Silvereyes eagerly feed on nectar of native and exotic plants including kowhai, fuchsia, eucalypts and bottlebrushes. They visit bird feeders more than any other species in New Zealand voraciously feeding on fat and lard, especially in winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvereye\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvereye</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/silvereye-or-wax-eye/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/silvereye-or-wax-eye/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/tauhou.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/tauhou.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Davidson, W.H. 1952.

Their flight is circular and darting in style, and they may be seen singly, in pairs or in flocks. Flocks often perch en masse, lined up on fences or power lines. They were named &#x2018;welcome swallows&#x2019; because they appeared in southern Australia as a herald of spring. Due to their elegant shape and flight, and their preference for nesting around buildings, swallows are noticed and appreciated more than most other small birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Welcome swallows are small, elegant birds with blunt heads, a deeply-forked tail and long pointed wings. Adults have rufous on the forehead, neck and breast and to a lesser degree (and paler) on the flanks. The bill is short, broad and black, and they have a black eye stripe. The back and upperwings are blue-black. The tail is dark with white spots towards the ends of the feathers that form a row of dots when the tail is spread in flight. The under parts are pale buff. The sexes differ only in that the females&#x2019; tail streamers are slightly shorter and the tail spots smaller. Juveniles are also similar but have darker heads and an overall duller colouring.</p>\n<p>Voice: fantail-like twittering, chattering and chirrups. Calls are generally quiet and do not carry far.</p>\n<p>Similar species: two martins and two swifts occur in New Zealand as rare vagrants. The tree martin and fairy martin are slightly smaller than welcome swallows and have dull white rumps and shorter, squarer tails. Fairy martin has rufous over the crown and nape (which are blue-black in welcome swallow), and tree martin has rufous colouration confined to a small spot above the bill. Fork-tailed swift and white-throated needletail are larger, longer-winged and darker underneath than welcome swallows. They are rarely seen perched. Both the swifts have pale markings on their back or rump, unlike the uniformly dark swallow.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Welcome swallows occur throughout New Zealand, though are rare or absent in Fiordland. They occur in most habitats other than dense forest or alpine areas. Swallows are most often seen close to wetlands or the coast. In colder areas they may migrate seasonally, and flocks travel long distances to reach good food sources. Welcome swallows are resident on the Chatham and Kermadec Islands and have been recorded as vagrants many times at the Snares and Auckland Islands, and&#xA0;twice at Campbell Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>A self-introduced species from Australia, welcome swallows were rare vagrants before the late 1950s and increased greatly through the 1960s and 1970s particularly in the North Island. Early records included Northland (1920), Auckland Islands (1943), Awhitu Peninsula (1944), Campbell Island (1946), Stewart Island (1953) and Farewell Spit (1955). Their arrival was closely monitored by bird-watchers, and resulted in perhaps the most amusing title ever penned for a New Zealand bird publication &#x2013; Barrie Heather&#x2019;s 1956 short note &#x2018;Welcome swallow at Farewell Spit&#x2019;.</p>\n<p>Welcome swallows first bred in New Zealand at Awanui, Northland in 1958. By 1965 they were common throughout Northland, spreading elsewhere in the North Island, and were breeding in the South Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The clearing of land and addition of built structures by European settlement in Australasia has been of benefit to welcome swallows and they are now an abundant native species.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Welcome Swallows can raise three broods between August and February. They build distinctive cup-shaped nests on ledges or attached to vertical supports usually on manmade structures such as houses, bridges and culverts, out of direct sunlight. Mud and grasses are used to build the nest from the base upwards and then it is lined with fine grasses and feathers. The 3-5 pinkish eggs with brown speckles are laid at 24-48 hour intervals and incubated by the female for 15 days. The nestlings are fed by both parents and fledge at 18 days old.&#xA0;Nestling wings grow at a constant rate regardless of fluctuations in food supply.&#xA0;Nests take 6-24 days to build, and are often re-used within and between breeding seasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Welcome swallows are gregarious. They often nest as pairs, but other birds may help with caring for the young. When not breeding they roost together in large numbers under bridges or in raupo swamps and they will mob predatory birds.

They are occasionally seen in Auckland suburbs, most likely after releases of caged birds held illegally in Auckland, or on&#xA0;ships entering port. It is also possible that they hitch rides on vessels arriving in New Zealand from the Pacific islands. Red-vented bulbuls are considered a horticultural pest species, and are an Unwanted Organism in New Zealand. If you think you have seen a red-vented bulbul, phone the Ministry for Primary Industries Pests and Diseases Hotline 0800 80 99 66.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Red-vented bulbuls are slim, starling-sized songbirds with predominantly dark plumage. They are typically bold and conspicuous, with&#xA0;repetitive, monotonous&#xA0;calls. Their slim build and curved bill are reminiscent of a honeyeater (e.g. bellbird or tui), although they are not closely related. The two most distinctive identification features are a small erectile crest on the crown (giving them a square-headed Roman helmet look when the crest is raised) and the diagnostic bright red patch between the base of the legs and the undertail. The head, hindneck and upper breast are glossy black, with a circular brown patch over the ear. This dark hood becomes streaked or scaly on the lower breast and merges into the pale grey belly. The upper wings and mantle are mid-brown with pale margins when in fresh plumage, creating a scaly appearance. The rump is white, and the tail is long and blackish with a prominent white tip. The bill, eyes and legs are dark. The sexes are alike, although males are slightly larger. Juveniles are dull brown with an orange or pinkish (cf. red) vent. </p>\n<p>Voice: a wide range of calls, from clear whistles to harsh chattering. The usual calls are a 2-3 syllable whistle <em>pee-plo,&#xA0;</em><em>pee-pee-plo </em>or<em> &apos;ginger-beer&apos;</em>, and a harsh double croak <em>cark-cark</em>. Loud scolding or chattering alarm calls may be directed at predators.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>No viable wild populations are known in New Zealand. Most New Zealand sightings were of single birds and pairs among leafy Auckland suburbs. Up to 50 birds established from 1952 onwards, in the suburbs of Remuera, Mt Eden, Stanley Bay and Takapuna, but were eradicated by 1955. Bulbul sightings have been reported sporadically around Auckland since the mid-1980s. Recent sightings (of birds since destroyed) have included Devonport, Parnell and Howick in 2005-06, three clusters in 2013-14 (Mangere, Mangere Bridge and Alfriston; Henderson, Lincoln and Massey; and Devonport, Belmont and Northcote,&#xA0;with an isolated sighting in Whangaparaoa), and one near Te Puke in May 2016.&#xA0;If red-vented bulbuls become established in New Zealand, they are most likely to spread throughout urban and horticultural areas in the northern North Island.</p>\n<p>The natural range of the red-vented bulbul includes India, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. They have been introduced into many countries, including Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, New Caledonia, Tahiti and Hawai&#x2019;i.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>No viable populations are known in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The main reason that efforts are being made to eradicate red-vented bulbuls in New Zealand is to eliminate any potential threat to horticulture, as the birds eat a wide variety of soft fruit and berries. Bulbuls are also aggressive, and may impact on native species in urban areas if they become established.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The only breeding recorded in New Zealand was a nest with 3 fresh eggs about 3 metres above the ground in a pine tree in Stanley Bay in December 1954. The nest was a lightly constructed shallow cup of twigs and coiled fibres, with a scanty lining of fine fibres, firmly anchored to a pine branch. The eggs were about 24 x 16 mm, pinkish, and marked all over with spots and blotches of reddish brown and pale purplish brown, especially around the widest part. In January 1955 a young bird begged for food from its presumed parent in Remuera.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Red-vented bulbuls are active and restless. They have a direct flight with rapid wingbeat, or may undulate over short distances, displaying the bold white rump. They often hawk for insects, with conspicuous fluttering beyond the foliage of shrubs and trees. Once established, red-vented bulbuls form flocks when not breeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Red-vented bulbuls are omnivorous. The main diet is fruit, but insects are also taken, particularly during the breeding season. Flowers and nectar are also consumed, and there are records of small lizards being taken on Pacific islands. In New Zealand they were recorded eating introduced wasps, native bees, cicadas and fruit, including plums and apples.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-vented_bulbul\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-vented_bulbul</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/responding/alerts/red-vented-bulbul/\">http://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/responding/alerts/red-vented-bulbul/</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Turbott, E.G. 1956.

Adult males are entirely black apart from their yellow bill and eye-ring. Females and juveniles are mostly dark brown, slightly mottled on the belly. Blackbirds are common in a wide range of habitats including suburban gardens, farmland, woodlands and indigenous forests. Their song is given from winter to summer, with the singing male usually perched on a high branch, tree top or power line. They sing most in the early morning and evening. Blackbirds feed mostly on the ground on earthworms, snails, and insects. They also take berries while perched in foliage.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The blackbird is larger than a song thrush and is further distinguished from it by having darker, more uniform plumage, which is entirely black in adult males. Males also have a yellow bill and a yellow eye-ring around their dark eye.

Juveniles are similar to adult females, but with light mottling over the body.</p>\n<p>Voice: the loud male territorial advertising song is mainly given from July to January. The song is similar to that of the song thrush, but without the repeated phrases that characterise thrush song. Other calls are given throughout the year, including a sharp quickly repeated alarm call made&#xA0;if a predator threatens.</p>\n<p>Similar species: female and juvenile blackbirds may be confused with song thrush, but thrushes are smaller and slimmer, with creamy-white underparts (speckled with brown) from chin to undertail.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Blackbirds are widespread throughout mainland New Zealand and off-shore islands from sea level up to about 1,500 m altitude, with a lower maximum altitude in the south. They occur in urban areas, farmlands, orchards and in lowland indigenous forests, being most abundant in urban gardens, parklands, farms and orchards. Blackbirds are also resident on most vegetated islands including Kermadec, Stewart, Chatham, Snares, Auckland and Campbell Islands; they occur as vagrants on Antipodes Island. The blackbird was the most widely reported bird species in the 1999-2004 <em>Atlas of Bird Distribution in New Zealand</em>, based on the number of grid squares occupied.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Blackbirds were introduced to New Zealand from 1862 on, and are now abundant throughout the country. They are usually seen as single birds or pairs. Even where 20 or more blackbirds feed in close proximity, e.g. on damp sports fields near a shrub border, they do not behave as a flock.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The main negative impact of Eurasian blackbirds is the damage they may cause to commercial fruit crops. They can also spread the seeds of weedy plants, and are often a nuisance in gardens by scattering mulch and newly planted seed beds and lawns. On the positive side of the ledger, blackbirds eat snails and slugs and other garden and horticultural invertebrate pests. They have no recognised impacts on native bird species, despite their ubiquitous distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Blackbirds breed as solitary, monogamous pairs nesting species, nesting between August and February, with a September &#x2013; November peak in most localities. Males establish territories from about April-May. Nests are usually well concealed by foliage in the forks of shrubs or trees 3 to 10 metres above the ground and are a well-constructed woven bowl of grass, small twigs, moss, fragments of plastic bags, dead leaves and may be lightly lined with mud (compare with song thrush nest with characteristic mud lining). One or both sexes build the nest. Eggs are laid from August to December. Three or more clutches (typically of 3-4 greenish-blue eggs) may be laid during a season especially if an earlier clutch is lost. Incubation is shared by both sexes and takes 13-14 days. Both sexes feed the chicks. The nestlings are blind and naked when hatched. They are well feathered 12-13 days after hatching, and fledge when about 13-15 days old. Both sexes share with feeding of fledglings, which are often fed for several weeks after leaving the nest. A song thrush has been observed to have laid its eggs in the nest of a blackbird (an example of brood parasitism) but the two song thrush young that hatched out were ejected from the nest, which was subsequently deserted.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Blackbirds are commonly seen feeding on the ground in parklands, woodlands and suburban gardens, walking slowly or running short distances looking for food. They are often seen to &#x2018;listen&#x2019; for food, e.g. earthworms, beneath the ground surface. They are strongly territorial, and may chase other species, including tui. Blackbirds are strong flyers and have reached all of New Zealand&#x2019;s outlying island groups; they are not considered migratory in New Zealand. Moulting mostly occurs in late summer&#x2013;autumn, with males ceasing to sing for the duration of their moult.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Blackbirds mainly eat earthworms, insects, spiders, snails and slugs. They mainly forage on the ground on lawns or pasture, or among leaf litter under trees, hedges, forests or in woodlands. They also eat the small berries of some shrubs such as coprosma, and can eat ripening fruit in orchards.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Blackbird\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Blackbird</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/blackbird.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/blackbird.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gill, B.J. 2010.

The eggs are light blue-green or pale blue with tiny dark spots at the larger end. Incubation is mostly by the female and takes 12-13 days. Young are blind and naked when hatched and open their eyes after 5-6 days. They are well-feathered 12 days after hatching, and fledge at 12-14 days. Both sexes share feeding, including of fledglings. A song thrush has been observed to have laid its eggs in the nest of a blackbird (an example of brood parasitism) but the two song thrush young that hatched out were ejected from the nest, which was subsequently deserted.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Song thrushes are usually seen singly or in pairs. They are best known for their varied and attractive song, hence the name, given mostly in winter, spring and early summer. They are commonly seen feeding on the ground in parklands, woodlands and suburban gardens, walking slowly or running short distances looking for food. Like blackbirds, they tend to &#x2018;listen&#x2019; for food, e.g. earthworms, beneath the ground surface. They are well known to break the shell of snails to get at the soft animal, by smashing the shell on a stone or path with a quick flick of the head. Although they are good flyers long flights seem to be infrequent. They are not considered to be migratory in New Zealand, although some local seasonal movement may occur. Moulting occurs in late summer &#x2013; autumn.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Song thrushes mainly eat earthworms, various insects, spiders, snails and slugs found on lawns, under trees, hedges, forests or in woodlands. They&#xA0;also eat the small berries of some shrubs such as coprosma, and can eat ripening fruit in orchards.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Thrush\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Thrush</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/thrush.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/thrush.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Gill, B.J. 2010.

The species is known only from the unique specimen. Many species of fossil penguin have been discovered in New Zealand but <em>Kumimanu </em>stands out as being particularly large and unusually old. The size of this species shows that some of the earliest penguins were giants (i.e. much larger than the emperor penguin) and that such sizes were achieved at the dawn of penguin evolution, soon after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago.</p>\n<p>In 2015, painstaking work by preparator Al Mannering extracted the bones of the <em>Kumimanu</em> specimen from the hard rock that it was encased in and it was only then that the bones were able to be identified as being from a penguin.</p>\n<p>The age of <em>Kumimanu</em> is notable because the only older penguins known globally are two much smaller species from Canterbury, New Zealand. These species, <em>Waimanu manneringi</em> and <em>Waimanu tuatahi</em>, are 58-62 million years old, while <em>Kumimanu</em> is 55-60 million years old. <em>Kumimanu</em> and <em>Waimanu</em> are considered to be each other&#x2019;s closest relatives. In combination, these fossils indicate that penguins may have originated in the Zealandia region.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The unique specimen is identifiable by its enormous size, its age, and a combination of bone features which show a close relationship with other early penguin species. These include&#xA0;the broad head of the humerus when compared with the relatively narrow humerus shaft width, the rounded rather than flattened ulna, and the shape of the coracoid and scapula. Nothing is known about the external appearance of <em>Kumimanu</em> but other early penguins have exceptionally long beaks.</p>\n<p><em>Kumimanu</em> rivalled the largest penguin species ever found. It is estimated to have stood 1.65 m high and weighed 101 kg, compared with the emperor penguin at 1.1 m high and 30 kg. Two isolated broken bones of a c.40 million year old Antarctic species, <em>Palaeeudyptes klekowskii</em>, may have come from a slightly larger bird, but the <em>Kumimanu</em> specimen consists of multiple bones (coracoid, scapula, sternum, humerus, ulna, femur, tibiotarsus and vertebrae), showing that this species was consistently huge throughout its body. At 161 mm, <em>Kumimanu</em> has the longest femur ever reported from a penguin.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>At the time of deposition, the site where <em>Kuminanu</em> was discovered would have been much warmer than present day Otago. It is a common misconception that penguins only live in cold water &#x2013; many other penguin fossils have been found at sites that would have had warm temperatures, and today the Galapagos penguin (<em>Spheniscus mendiculus</em>) lives at the equator.</p>\n<p>The unique specimen probably died at sea and sank to the bottom of the ocean where it was buried by sediments, only to be uplifted later by tectonic movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01959-6\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01959-6</a>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01959-6#auth-1\">Gerald Mayr</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01959-6#auth-2\">R.

They have iridescent purple and green feathers tipped with white spots, but appear black at a distance. Large flocks roost communally at traditional sites, spreading out to pasture and urban feeding grounds each day. One of the commonest garden birds, starlings are easily recognised by their noisy, hyperactive behaviour. They are resident throughout New Zealand on open country, including most offshore islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Starlings are compact, with short tails, and appear smaller than thrushes or blackbirds although of similar weight. Their feathers have white spots which wear off, leaving a dark iridescent breeding plumage. Wing and tail feathers are blackish, edged with pale brown. Males&apos; eyes are dark; females have a pale brown edge to the iris. The sex and age (as first-year or older) can be told from the length of iridescence on the throat hackle feathers. Juveniles leaving the nest are pale greyish brown, and join in flocks of 20-100. Feeding flocks progress in a rolling fashion as birds in the rear overtake the leaders. Starlings probe with the bill shut, then open it to look into the hole formed. Their eyes, placed far forward in the skull, give binocular vision. Their flight is strong and direct, and evening aggregations of thousands wheeling in unison are spectacular, especially when falcon attacks cause waves of cohesion.</p>\n<p>Voice: shrill whistles, song with interspersed clicks and gurgles, and a penetrating scream when handled. Starlings can imitate other sounds (e.g. police sirens, telephones, voices) with uncanny accuracy, and incorporate calls and song phrases from other bird species in their song.</p>\n<p>Similar species: there are no similar species in New Zealand, where the only other member of the same family is the common myna. Juvenile starlings are greyish-brown, paler under the chin, and have been mistaken for thrushes, cuckoos, and even waders; but their shape, eye position and behaviour are characteristic.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and Habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Starlings occur throughout New Zealand, from sea level to 1500 m altitude, in all open country, on the coast, and in towns. They are absent from alpine areas and native forest, although they may nest at forest edges. Starlings are resident on the Kermadec, Snares, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands, and are vagrant to the Bounty Islands. Their natural distribution is in the palaearctic, from the United Kingdom east to Lake Baikal. Starlings were introduced to eastern USA (1890) and spread west and north to Canada and Alaska (1952), and south to Mexico (1953). They were also introduced to Australia (1857), New Zealand (1862), South Africa (1898), and Argentina (1987),&#xA0;and spread east to Japan (1969).</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Common starlings increased dramatically soon after their introduction to New Zealand. For example, 4 in Napier became &#x201C;hundreds of thousands&#x201D; within 11 years. Numbers then declined and stabilised, but there was a marked decrease following the widespread use of DDT from the 1950s until it was banned in 1968. New Zealand starlings still accumulate more DDT than in any other country, but probably not to lethal levels, and they remain one of our commonest birds. European populations have declined by half in the past 30 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Starlings, introduced to&#xA0;control caterpillar plagues, were&#xA0;apparently successful. Their use in grass grub control has been bypassed by chemicals, but may become important in an organic future; some farmers encourage them with nest-boxes (millions are in use in Russia).&#xA0;Damage to farm animal feed lots, cereal crops, and fruit may be locally severe.&#xA0;They remove ticks from sheep and cattle; but could spread the bacterial and viral diseases ticks carry. Pest control operators list about 24 diseases carried by starlings, although &quot;the evidence is largely indirect and circumstantial.&quot; Their nests have caused at least one death by blocking chimneys, and they have similarly caused fires in aircraft, and hundreds of fires in tractors and other farm machinery.</p>\n<p>Starling flocks are significant in the 400 bird strikes per year reported in New Zealand. Nests under house eaves are noisy, smelly, may attract rodents, and are often infested with fleas and mites. Communal roosts on islands become a source of weeds such as boxthorn, and may spread diseases like avian pox to bird reserves; roosts in towns are a public nuisance, with corrosive droppings. Competition for nest boxes has been identified as a potential problem at some restoration sites, with starlings using nest boxes placed for black robins, Forbes&apos; parakeets and yellow-crowned parakeets on Rangatira, Mangere and Mana Islands.&#xA0;However, an&#xA0;American study found the effects of starlings on populations of 27 cavity-nesting birds to be practically non-existent, and none of the New Zealand studies have demonstrated that the native birds were limited by nest site competition.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Starlings nest in cavities: in hollow trees, dead tree-fern trunks, under the eaves of houses, in letter boxes, crevices in cliffs and burrows. Big cavities may be filled with up to a cubic meter of material. Bird boxes are readily used. The nest is usually made of dry grass lined with finer material, but anything available is welcome. They excavate sites in clay banks or roadside cuttings (recorded only in New Zealand). Some nest in open sites, e.g. ponga crowns or dense trees. Starlings often nest colonially; males defend 1-2 m from the nest, and may control several sites and females. Breeding is synchronised, with most eggs laid within 7 days of the median laying date in September-October. Unlike starlings in Europe, the start of breeding is not correlated with latitude. Replacement clutches and late starters lay in November, and successful early nesters may have a second brood in early December. Clutch size averages 4-5 (1-9), but some (10%) clutches are enlarged by dumping or two females sharing a nest. Incubation period 12 days, fledging 20-24 days. Many chicks do not survive to fledge. Males incubate in the mornings, and both parents feed the young until 1-2 weeks after fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Although starlings depend on humans for access to crops, pasture, and buildings to nest in, they are difficult to approach. Much behaviour is social, as they feed, travel and roost in large flocks (in Europe numbering millions), and squabble over food, nests, and mates. Nests are visited morning and evening for most of the year. Breeding males sing with throat hackles raised, waving their wings. They lead females to the nest, carrying green leaves. At dusk they fly up to 30 km to a central roost, in trees or shrubs, often on an island or the centre of a city. These roosts are used throughout the year except by nesting females.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The main diet is pasture invertebrates, including earthworms, caterpillars, beetles and their larvae, and spiders. Starlings take grain from hen runs, and readily take food scraps in urban areas. Soft fruit (apples, pears, cherries, grapes) may be damaged. Cicadas are caught on the wing, and&#xA0;starlings also take nectar from flowers, and so (as a result) they are often seen with orange flax pollen on their foreheads.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://aulaenred.ibercaja.es/wp-content/uploads/416_StarlingSvulgaris.pdf\">http://aulaenred.ibercaja.es/wp-content/uploads/416_StarlingSvulgaris.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Starling\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Starling</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Bull, P.C.; Flux, J.E.C. 2000.

It was introduced to many Pacific lands, including New Zealand, usually to combat invertebrate pests. Mynas are large, conspicuous passerines. A shiny black head and shoulder plumage merges into vinous brown for the remainder of the body and a large patch of white is flashed from each wing during flight. They are commonly seen deftly avoiding traffic while foraging for road-killed insects. At dusk small groups join communal roosts, which may comprise many hundreds of individuals. Mynas, originally widely introduced to New Zealand in the 1870s, are found in all suitable manmade habitat north of 40&#xB0; S, including forest remnants and many offshore islands, but are in low numbers or absent from some parts of the volcanic plateau and large forest tracts such as Urewera.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Mynas are stocky brown birds with a shiny black head and shoulders. They are commonly seen in pairs or in small family groups. Adult primaries are black when new but fade to brown. The base of primaries is white and all upper and lower coverts are also white. The tail is black when new, all feathers tipped in white which abrades off during the breeding season. The bill and naked eye surround is bright yellow. The iris is dark brown over grey, with distinct white flecks. Legs are yellow brown and the claws horn-coloured. Juveniles are of paler plumage, the bill is light yellow streaked with dark grey, and the skin around the eye is white for the first two weeks. Juvenile tail feathers are without white tips and the iris is grey.</p>\n<p>Voice: a loud <em>chickork-chickork-chickork</em> (territorial proclamation) given while head-bobbing, may be accompanied by a complicated series of quiet calls including <em>pee pee pee</em>, bell-like notes and deep guttural booming. Other quiet trills are used when inviting a mate to fly.</p>\n<p>Similar species: there are no similar species in New Zealand; the common starling is the only other member of same family.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>North of 40&#xB0; S, mynas are found throughout the North Island and offshore islands but are absent from some areas of the volcanic plateau and large forested tracts such as Urewera National Park. They are also rare in the interior of forest remnants. Their natural distribution includes the entire South Asian region. They are now found on all continents with the exception of South America and Antarctica, and also many islands in the pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. They are widely regarded as serious invasive pests.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The myna evolved to live in the tropics. It appears that the ambient temperature south of 40&#xB0; S (i.e. Marton to Waipukurau) was insufficient to allow long term population survival. Some groups of mynas held on for many years around piggeries, but when whole milk collection replaced butter fat production and piggeries became rarer, the mynas could not balance their energy budget and died out. North of 40&#xB0; S the population spread and increased, so that now in the north of the North Island mynas are one of our most conspicuous birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Mynas nest in cavities, inside the eaves of houses, in letter boxes and cardboard cartons (even on the ground) and nesting boxes. Nest are made of dried grass, straw, cellophane and plastic and lined with green leaves - often eucalyptus leaves - just prior to laying. Nest preparation begins in late August to early September. Nests can be built in a week but usually take a few weeks. Laying begins in November and is finished by early February; Two peaks to egg laying representing first and second clutches occur in November and January. The few clutches between these two peaks are either replacement clutches, or clutches laid by inexperienced pairs. Clutch size averages 4 (1-6), the incubation period is 14 days; only the female has a true brood patch. Nestlings fledge 25 (20-32) days after hatching. Both parents feed the fledglings for 2-3 weeks, and approximately 20% of these die before independence. Productivity is about 2 chicks per annum per pair to independence.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Mynas are not obviously sexually dimorphic. They pair for life but quickly find a new mate on the death of their previous mate. Both members of a pair proclaim ownership of a nest and territory using the head bob and loud call display described above, and vigorously defend their nest site and feeding territory against all other mynas. They destroy eggs and nestlings of any other species within their territory (especially starlings). Territories measured in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay averaged about 1.5 ha (0.6-2.3). In winter, they fly to communal roost up to 2 km distant. In the morning, they forage on roads then return to their nest site.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Mynas are omnivorous. They consume pasture and crop invertebrates, including some that are crop pests. Also nightshade fruit and other fruit, especially berries. They peck at the flesh of ripe karaka fruit rather than swallowing the whole fruit. Mynas are most often seen along roads, where they seek road-killed insects. They often frequent refuse dumps in winter, seeking food scraps, and flock onto paddocks being ploughed. Mynas also take nectar, and are sometimes seen with orange flax pollen on their foreheads.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.issg.org/cii/electronic%20references/pii/references/pii_review_of_the_biology_and_ecology_of_the_common_myna_and_some_implications_for_management.pdf\">http://www.issg.org/cii/electronic%20references/pii/references/pii_review_of_the_biology_and_ecology_of_the_common_myna_and_some_implications_for_management.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Myna\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Myna</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/mynah.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/mynah.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Counsilman, J.J. 1974.

It lives mostly in close association with man. This ubiquity has led to many studies of it as a pest and of its physiology, energetics, behaviour, genetics and evolution. There is even a scientific journal devoted to work on the house sparrow and other <em>Passer </em>species.</p>\n<p>House sparrows were introduced to New Zealand first in the mid 1860s. They soon became abundant and were said to be combating plagues of agricultural pests. By the 1880s, however, they were regarded as&#xA0;pests. Sparrows have made their own way to offshore islands, breeding on those with human habitation. They have evolved differences in morphology in response to local environments. The best source of information on sparrow biology is the monograph by Summers-Smith, although adjustment for the six-month difference in seasons is necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Males are smart chestnut-brown, white-and-grey with a distinctive black &#x201C;bib&#x201D;; they are difficult to confuse with any other species. Females and young lack the bib and are greyer, with lighter brown dorsal plumage than the male. Their underparts are plain grey, but their backs and wings are variegated several shades of brown and white. The robust conical bill is black in breeding males, otherwise pale pinkish-brown. The eyes are dark brown and legs dull pink.</p>\n<p>Voice: the familiar unmelodious chirp is the male&#x2019;s song, and the same call is used by both sexes in roosts and other social gatherings. The alarm call is harsher.</p>\n<p>Similar species: females and juveniles can be confused with dunnock, greenfinch or chaffinch. Dunnocks are smaller, with darker, more sombre plumage, and a slender dark bill. They usually stay close to cover, and are never in large flocks. Chaffinches differ in their distinctive double wing-bar and white outer tail. The young of greenfinches are greenish above their shorter tail. In comparison with finches, sparrow flight generally is more direct, almost laboured, and usually low.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>House sparrows are found everywhere except for high mountains and bush. They are most abundant in the north and in drier eastern areas and in association with arable farming and human habitation, including towns and cities. House sparrows are a common breeding species on the Chatham Islands, and have been recorded as vagrants on the Snares, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Sparrows vie with silvereyes in being the most abundant New Zealand bird, at least near human habitation. The population density in New Zealand is about 25 times that in comparable habitat in Britain, probably reflecting the scarcity of specialised predators of small birds in New Zealand. They are remarkably sedentary and even the large post-breeding flocks of late summer and early autumn venture no more than few kilometres from the breeding area. Survival rates are not known, but must be higher than at similar latitudes abroad, given the lower breeding productivity here. Mass mortality can occur when autumn roosts are hit by heavy rain, or in unseasonable snowstorms. In 2001, the New Zealand population suffered from an epidemic strain of <em>Salmonella</em>, but appears to have recovered. Populations in parts of Britain and north-western Europe declined significantly in the 1990s and have not recovered to previous numbers. The cause of this is unknown, but there is no evidence that New Zealand populations have similarly suffered.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts </strong></p>\n<p>House sparrows take ripening grain, mainly wheat and barley, although the impact varies from field to field and within an individual field. The damage is economically significant, averaging around 5% of the potential yield of the crop. Other damage, such as to seedling peas, apples, soft fruit and fruit tree buds is less, but can be significant to individual farmers.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Breeding is semi-colonial, but nests are normally spaced over a metre apart, mainly in holes in buildings. The chirping male defends a small territory around the nest site. Eggs are laid from late September to early February. Incubation overnight is by the female; the male has no brood patch and plays a minor role by day only. Sparrows are largely monogamous, but studies abroad show a low incidence of polygamy and brood parasitism, with up to 10% of nestlings not from the nesting pair. The male feeds the nestlings more when the young are small, but the roles reverse for older nestlings. Another clutch can be initiated within five days of a brood fledging, but the interval averages 10 days. The average clutch is 3.8 and there are up to four clutches a year, but mortality of eggs and nestlings is high. Given this, breeding productivity in New Zealand is remarkably low, averaging between 1.6 and 1.9 fledglings per nest, lower than comparable figures for Britain, but it does vary greatly from place to place and year to year.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The sparrow is a flocking species, and is not often seen alone. Roosting is communal: sometimes several hundreds in dense shrubs or trees. The secret of the sparrow&#x2019;s success seems to lie in its association with man; both the nest sites and much of the food depend upon human endeavour and it is exceptional to find sparrows living away from habitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>The diet in New Zealand is similar to that in temperate climes abroad. Adults eat mainly grain, including cereal and maize crops, but also the buds, flowers, nectar, fruit and seeds of a wide range of other introduced plants (especially amaranth, birch, knotweed, meadow grass, fat-hen, chickweed and mouse-ear). Around towns and cities, much of the diet is human food scraps provided inadvertently or deliberately, especially bread. Invertebrates are a minor element of the adult diet, mainly beetles, grasshoppers, bugs, aphids, scale insects, caterpillars, craneflies, muscid flies and spiders. Occasionally, sparrows hawk for flying insects, e.g. cicadas. Small nestlings are fed predominantly on invertebrates. As the nestlings become older, their parents bring more vegetable matter, including the softer items of the adult diet, but still feed many invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Sparrow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Sparrow</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Alley, M.R. <em>et al. </em>2002.

They are birds of open country, including the tideline of sandy beaches, rough pasture, river beds and above the tree-line. Pipits are members of the wagtail family, and frequently flick their long tails as they walk. In flight their tails have narrow white sides &#x2013; a character shared with skylarks, chaffinches, yellowhammers and cirl buntings.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand pipits are slender, small to medium-sized, long-tailed songbirds that are predominantly streaked grey-brown above and off-white below, with brown streaking on the breast. They have a prominent pale eyebrow stripe, and white outer tail feathers. Their crown is streaked grey-brown, lacking any crest (cf. skylark) The bill is fine and dark, and the legs long, slender and pale brown. Pipits are often confiding, allowing closer approach than most open country songbirds. They walk or run, characteristically flicking their tail up and down whenever they stop walking, or when perched.</p>\n<p>Voice: the main call given all year is a strident <em>tzweep. </em>Song given in air with arched fluttering flight over home ranges. <em>Tswee </em>call given from fence posts and on the ground when gathering large invertebrates to feed young on the nest.</p>\n<p>Similar species: skylarks are tawnier, more likely to fly when disturbed, are shorter legged, hop rather than walk, and have a small erectile crest on the back of the crown. Female house sparrows and chaffinches have conical bills, and white wing-bars on the inner upperwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand pipits are widespread in rough open habitats from the coastline to alpine shrublands at c.1900 m. They are often seen along coastlines and rivers, in alpine areas in the South Island, and coastal margins and alpine areas on Stewart Island. Pipits are present within felled compartments of pine forests in the central North Island, and around remaining wetlands in the central North Island. They have declined in nearby subalpine habitats that have been taken over by heather. Pipits are common in farmland and open shrublands on Chatham and Pitt Islands, and in tussock grasslands and open habitats on the Auckland Island, Campbell Island and Antipodes Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Farmland population estimates for pipits were 0.37 pairs/per ha on Chatham Island, and 0.036 pairs/ha at Waipu Caves, Whangarei.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Pipits probably benefitted initially from forest clearance, but have declined in density as land-use has intensified. Heavily grazed pasture and drained wetlands hold fewer pipits than rough pasture with patches of fern, and marshes or bogs. Pipits have declined from drought-prone regions, and have disappeared from many islands where rats are present. While pipits use clear-felled pine forest blocks in the central North Island, they are preferentially hunted by New Zealand falcons there, compared to introduced passerines. Pipit have greatly benefitted from rat eradication on some islands, most spectacularly on 11,000 ha Campbell Island in the New Zealand subantarctic.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>New Zealand pipits breed during August-March. The nest is a sizable cup of woven grass under tussocks and grass clumps within fern, and partly or fully covered with vegetation. Clutch size is typically 2-4 (average 3) eggs. Both sexes feed young on the nest. Incubation takes 14-16 days and chicks fledge at 14 days. Adults land and take concealed routes to nests. Chicks are noisy during and after feeding. Chicks do not congregate after fledging, and parents and fledglings can end up hundreds of meters from nest sites. The number of clutches per annum is unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Pipits are approachable, often running a short distance in front of people, and walking, rather than flying away. Some home ranges are occupied all year and others are deserted in the late summer. Flocks of first-year pipits and adults are seen in areas where there was no breeding population. Flock sizes are generally indicative of the population size. Flocks of tens to hundreds of pipits fanned out either sides of moving locomotives before the Volcanic Plateau was converted from swamp and shrubland to farms and plantation forests.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Pipits are omnivorous, consuming grains, seeds, and small invertebrates. Flying invertebrates taken include flies, mayflies, small butterflies and cicadas. Foraging methods adapt to the types of prey being targeted. They range from pecking at mat plants, to dashing along the ground and into short flights when after flies, to rising up into the wind over lakes to catch mayflies passing overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Pipit\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasian_Pipit</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/nzpipit.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/nzpipit.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Beauchamp, A.J. 1995.

They are a common sight in urban gardens and open country in southern New Zealand, but are scarcer in the northern North Island. The drab appearance of dunnocks is compensated by their stunningly complex breeding behaviours.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Dunnocks are small, slim songbirds with sombre brown plumage, streaked with darker brown on the back and flanks, and merging into the greyish eyebrow, chin, throat and breast. The blackish bill is fine and pointed, the iris of adults is red-brown, and the legs orange-brown. The sexes are alike; juveniles are similar but have brown eyes.</p>\n<p>Voice: the song is a thin warble, similar in structure to a blackbird&#x2019;s song, given by the male usually from a perch high in a tree. The contact call &#x2013; a high pitched <em>tseep</em> &#x2013; is a familiar sound of southern New Zealand suburbs, farms and shrublands in autumn and winter.</p>\n<p>Similar species: with their drab brown plumage, and tendency to forage on the ground, dunnocks superficially resemble house sparrows. However, house sparrows are larger, have a robust, triangular-shaped bill, and have more patterned upperparts, including a pale bar on the inner wing.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Dunnocks occur throughout the country from sea level to subalpine scrub at 1,600 m altitude, in orchards, farms, suburban gardens, scrub and forest. They are a common bird in southern New Zealand, but are scarce north from Waikato north, and are rare in Auckland city. Dunnocks are common and breed in the Chathams, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands, and are recorded as vagrant to The Snares. There is no evidence of migratory movements within New Zealand. The natural distribution of dunnocks ranges from Europe eastwards to the Ural mountains in Russia and south to the Caucasus region and northern Iran.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Dunnocks are common and widespread in New Zealand, apart from the northern North Island. In a study site in Dunedin, the mean density of males during the breeding season was 5 per hectare. In the same study, the sex ratio during the breeding season was skewed towards males, with 1.38 males for every female.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Dunnocks feed mainly on insects and other small invertebrates (see Food below). Its consumption of small invertebrates, was among the reasons dunnocks were introduced into New Zealand by Acclimatisation Societies. It was thought by the settlers that dunnocks could be used to control the numbers of insect pests in orchards. There are no known negative impacts of dunnocks on native species, but they are one of the few introduced bird species that has colonised (and thrives on) our most remote and otherwise least-modified island groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Dunnocks have complex mating system. Adults form mainly polyandrous or monogamous breeding groups that defend small territories (average 0.24 ha). Polyandrous groups are composed of one female simultaneously paired with two to three males that may or may not be related to each other. Polygynandrous mating groups, in which two females build nests in the same territory and are concurrently paired to two or more males, have been observed in low frequencies. Multiple paternity broods (i.e. where chicks are sired by more than one male) are common. In polyandrous groups, approximately 45% of nestlings are sired by the subordinate male of the group. In monogamous pairs, nearly 25% of chicks are sired by a male other than the social partner of the female.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>During the breeding season, females actively and profusely solicit copulations with their social partners and with extra-group males. The act of copulation is remarkable, while the female raises her tail and waggles it, the male pecks at her cloaca for up to a minute before mating. The nest is built by the female alone, and is usually constructed in the interior of dense bushes and shrubs. Females alone incubate the bright turquoise eggs, but receive some incubation feeding by males. During the nestling stage, females always feed the young, with males providing paternal care in varying degrees. After fledging, males take on a more pronounced role in caring for fledglings, while females prepare to re-nest (usually once or twice more per season).</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Dunnocks forage on the ground and low levels of vegetation, such as bushes and shrubs, usually solitarily or in small groups (up to five adults). Their diet is mainly small invertebrates such as beetles, flies, ants and spiders. Adults often feed nestlings with much larger insect prey, e.g. moths up to 5-10 times their bill length.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunnock\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunnock</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob10840.htm\">http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob10840.htm</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 2005. <em>The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

The sexes may segregate into separate flocks in winter, especially males; hence the specific name of <em>coelebs</em> (bachelor).</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Male chaffinches are similar in size to a house sparrow, with the females being a little smaller. They are sexually dimorphic; males are brightly coloured in spring and summer with brick-red breasts and chestnut mantles. The crown and nape are greyish-blue and the wings are black with a prominent white wing-bar and shoulder patch. During winter, the colours are duller due to the presence of buff tips to the feathers which wear off by early spring. Females are dull brownish-grey, but with similar wing markings as the males. Both sexes have white in the outer tail-feathers which is conspicuous in flight.</p>\n<p>Voice: the call is a familiar &#x2018;chink chink&#x2019;, uttered by both sexes throughout the year. The male has a short rattling song, frequently repeated, during the breeding season.</p>\n<p>Similar species: males are not readily confused with any other species, but the female can be mistaken for a female house sparrow. However, the female chaffinch is slimmer, lacks dark streaks on the upper surface and has prominent white wing markings.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Chaffinches are widespread throughout the New Zealand mainland and on the Chatham Islands, and are resident on Stewart Island and also the Snares, Auckland and Campbell Islands. Recorded as a vagrant on Norfolk, Lord Howe, Kermadec and Antipodes Islands.</p>\n<p>The natural range of the chaffinch is Europe, western and central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. It also inhabits islands in the north Atlantic. It was also successfully introduced to South Africa.</p>\n<p>Chaffinches occupy a wide range of habitats from sea-level to 1400 m, wherever there are trees or scrub. They inhabit pine and other exotic forests, indigenous forests and sub-alpine scrub, and are common in gardens, parks, orchards and farmland with shelterbelts and hedgerows.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The chaffinch was slow to become established in New Zealand, but is now abundant throughout the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Chaffinches are not generally considered to be an important agricultural pest, although they have been known to cause minor damage to fruit buds and newly-sown crops. Impacts on native species have not been reported.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Chaffinches are territorial and monogamous during the breeding season, which lasts from September to February. Males establish a territory and commence singing in late July or early August. Females visit the territory with increasing frequency and one eventually forms a pair bond with the resident male. However, the female may leave the territory during nest-building and mate with other males in territories nearby. The male&#x2019;s courtship display consists of a headlong chase during which it appears that he is attacking his mate. He also presents himself to the female in a lop-sided posture with his head feathers raised. The female constructs a neat cup-shaped nest of fine grass, wool and moss camouflaged with lichen on the outside, and lined with feathers and hair. This is located in a tree or shrub 1-18 m above the ground. She incubates alone for 11-15 days, and when the chicks hatch they are fed invertebrates by both parents. The chicks continue to be fed for about 3 weeks after fledging. Chaffinches are normally single-brooded, but occasionally raise a second clutch.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Chaffinches form flocks of varying size outside the breeding season, often with other species of finches and buntings, especially at a good food source e.g. weeds growing amongst crops. They may also form mixed flocks with native species such as fantails and silvereyes in indigenous forests in autumn. Chaffinches usually feed on seeds on the ground, but also in trees such as pines and native beeches. Insects are located by searching the branches and foliage of trees and shrubs, or are taken from the ground. Chaffinches also catch insects by hawking, especially around rivers and streams.</p>\n<p>Some seasonal movement has been reported. Birds from higher altitudes move to lower elevations in autumn, and birds from indigenous forests winter on farmland. Birds from the South Island appear in the southern North Island in varying numbers yearly from April to July. This has not been confirmed by banding recoveries, but these birds can be identified by their different dialect. The normal contact call of chaffinches from the North Island (and also British birds) could be rendered as &#x201C;chink chink&#x2019;, whereas that of the South Island bird sounds more like &#x2018;chek chek&#x2019;.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Chaffinches feed predominantly on seeds in winter. A wide range of seeds are taken, including tree seeds such as those of beeches, <em>Pinus radiata, </em>and rimu. Flax seeds are taken directly from heads, or collected on the ground. Other seeds taken from on or near the ground include cereals, fat hen, chickweed, <em>Amaranthus, </em>dandelion and thistle. Chicks are fed almost entirely on invertebrates both before and after fledging, and a large proportion of the adult diet also consists of invertebrates during the breeding season. Invertebrates taken include bugs, flies, beetles, moths, caterpillars, aphids, cicadas and spiders.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/chaffinch.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/chaffinch.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaffinch\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaffinch</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Dean, S. 1990.

A heavy bill allows the bird to crack larger seeds than other species can manage. They were introduced from Britain by Acclimatisation Societies between 1862 and 1868, and are now common throughout much of the mainland. Greenfinches feed mostly on seeds, including those from a number of crops; therefore they are regarded as a pest in some districts. Large flocks are frequent outside the breeding season, often mixed with other species of finches.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Greenfinches are similar in size to, but more thickset than a house sparrow. They are sexually dimorphic; males are green, varying in intensity, with some yellow on the abdomen. There are bright yellow bars on the leading edges of the wings. The female, by contrast, is dull and sparrow-like with little yellow on the wings. Juveniles are similar to the adult female, but more streaked.</p>\n<p>Voice: the male has a not unpleasant song during the breeding season, and also utters a loud <em>dzweee </em>call frequently during this time.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the male greenfinch is similar in colour to both the silvereye and the endemic bellbird. It can be distinguished from both of these by its far heavier bill, and larger size in comparison with the silvereye. The female could be confused with the female house sparrow, but is more olive-brown in general colouration, and also more finely streaked.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Greenfinches are widespread throughout most of the mainland, though scarce or absent in alpine areas, and areas of extensive native forest. They are common along sandy beaches on the Chatham Islands and on Norfolk Island (thought to originate from birds from New Zealand), and vagrant on Lord Howe, Kermadec, Snares and Campbell Islands.</p>\n<p>The natural range of the Greenfinch is Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and western Asia. It was also successfully introduced to the Azores and eastern Australia.</p>\n<p>Greenfinches mainly occupy man-modified habitats including farmland, scrub, pine plantations, orchards and suburban parks and gardens. They are found to a lesser degree in native forests, but seldom far from the fringes.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Greenfinches are locally common in both the North and South Islands, with small numbers on most off-shore islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Greenfinches can be a serious pest of ripening seed crops, especially rapeseed and radish. There have also been reports of damage to cereal crops, and linseed crops are frequently targeted. They are known to attack the fruit buds of stonefruit and pipfruit trees, but rarely cause serious damage. There are no reported impacts on native bird species. Greenfinches are known to eat the seeds of various native trees including beeches and kahikatea, mostly from trees near forest margins. However, they are unlikely to compete with native seed-eaters such as the native parakeets (kakariki), which mainly occur within extensive forest tracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Greenfinches can breed when less than a year old, and can rear up to 3 broods in a season. They are not territorial, but do defend a small area adjacent to the nest. The nest is a fairly bulky structure of twigs, grass and moss, lined with feathers, hair and down. It is normally built in a tree or shrub at a height of 2-3 m. Usually 5 eggs are laid. The female incubates alone, but is fed on the nest, or nearby, by the male. When the chicks hatch, they are fed by regurgitation on a diet consisting largely of seeds, by the female at first, and later by the male also. The chicks fledge after about 15-16 days, and are fed for a further 3 weeks or so.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Greenfinches are monogamous during the breeding season, but forms flocks during the autumn and winter months. These flocks range in size from fewer than 10 individuals to one estimated at 10,000 birds. They often form mixed flocks with other finches at good food sources, e.g. annual weeds growing amongst crops. Greenfinches frequently associate with sparrows and silvereyes feeding on food provided by people in gardens.</p>\n<p>Greenfinches are believed to be mostly sedentary, but birds from the mainland have reached many outlying islands unaided. There is no evidence of regular migration, however local movements are often dictated by food availability.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Seeds form the bulk of the greenfinch diet, and are taken from a wide range of plants, trees and shrubs. They have a particular liking for the seeds of brassicas including both wild (wild turnip and wild radish), and cultivated types (rapeseed). Greenfinches are partial to the seeds of <em>Pinus radiata,</em> taking them directly from the opening cones, or from the ground. Thistle seeds are frequently taken, mostly from the ground. However, the large seeds of the variegated thistle are extracted from the heads as they start to open. Other weed species recorded in the diet include <em>Amaranthus,</em> chickweed, fat-hen, dandelion<em>, Poa annua</em> and wireweed. Seeds are also eaten from a range of berries, including <em>Cotoneaster </em>and African boxthorn. Seeds from cultivated species reported as being consumed include cereals, sunflower, maize, clover, tamarillo, kiwifruit, passionfruit and apple. Invertebrates form a minor part of the diet; Greenfinches have been observed consuming aphids, caterpillars, moths, flies, beetles and bugs. One bird was observed taking bees directly from a hive.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/greenfinch.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/greenfinch.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Greenfinch\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Greenfinch</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.A. 1996.<em> The field guide to the birds of New Zealand</em>.

Introduced from Britain 1862-1883, their tinkling calls contribute to the collective noun &#x201C;a charm of goldfinches&#x201D;. They are mainly seed-eaters, and often gather in flocks to feed on thistle seed. Goldfinches frequently stray to outlying island groups, and are resident on the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Goldfinches are smaller than a house sparrow, with a bright yellow wingbar visible both in flight and when perched. Wings and tail otherwise black (some white spots near tail tip), contrasting with the buff-brown back. Adults have diagnostic bright red, white and black facial feathering. The red is more extensive in the males, especially above and behind the eye. Juveniles have drab brown on the head. Often in flocks (small or large), goldfinches have a bouncy undulating flight.</p>\n<p>Voice:&#xA0;a liquid, tinkly calling, often given by flocks in flight. Also a shrill, clear <em>pee-yu</em>.</p>\n<p>Similar species: The slightly larger greenfinch also has yellow at the base of the primaries, forming a diffuse patch on the outer wing. All finches have similar undulating flight, but can be distinguished by their calls.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the country from sea level up to about 500 m altitude, in farmland, orchards, coastal vegetation, riverbeds, plantations and urban areas &#x2013; almost anywhere other than dense native forest. Goldfinches are locally common on the Chatham Islands, and occur as vagrants on the Kermadec, Snares, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands. They occur naturally throughout Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and western Asia, and were introduced to New Zealand, Australia, Argentina and Bermuda.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Common and widespread since the 1920s, flocks in the non-breeding season may number several hundred birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts </strong></p>\n<p>Goldfinches mainly eat the seeds of introduced weeds, especially thistles. Apart from pecking seeds from uncovered strawberries, they are generally considered neutral or beneficial to the rural economy. They have no recognised impacts on native species. Note that New Zealand has no native finch species. Kakariki parakeets are the only native birds that regularly eat small seeds (other than those encased in fruit); kakariki are now mainly found in forest habitats, where few finches occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding </strong></p>\n<p>Monogamous within each breeding season, goldfinch pairs defend a small territory around the nest, with the male singing his pleasant liquid song from a nearby perch. The small woven cup nest lined with thistle down, feathers or wool is usually placed among foliage in an outer fork of a tree, shrub or grape vine. The breeding season from October to February allows time to raise two broods of up to six chicks each (typically 4-5). The male feeds the female on the nest while she incubates and broods the young chicks; both sexes feed the chicks for their final week in the nest, and for the first 2-3 weeks after fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Agile and acrobatic when seeking seeds, goldfinches often hang upside down from seed heads, and flutter from plant to plant. Although they often allow a close approach when feeding, goldfinches generally show little interest in bird food tables, and so are less familiar than house sparrows, silvereyes and chaffinches. Outside the breeding season, goldfinches often occur in mixed flocks with other finches and yellowhammers. Goldfinches specialise in seeking the tiny winged seeds of thistles, and so often occur in single-species groups among a larger flock. Goldfinches have quick, short life-cycles, potentially producing ten or more young per season, and breeding at one-year-old. They are not considered migratory, but there is probably altitudinal movement in response to food availability. Reports of small flocks crossing Cook Strait have yet to be confirmed by band recoveries. Full song is mainly given October-March.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Forage on ground and at all levels of vegetation, usually in small flocks. Diet predominantly weed seeds, supplemented by small invertebrates especially during the breeding season, when they are fed to the growing chicks. Important food items include seeds of thistles, pigweed and fat hen (<em>Chenopodium</em> spp.), dandelion, chickweed, <em>Poa annua</em>, ryegrass, paspalum and other grasses.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Goldfinch\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Goldfinch</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/introduced-land-birds/12\">www.teara.govt.nz/en/introduced-land-birds/12</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Campbell, P.O. 1972.

They were introduced from Britain between 1862 and 1875, and are now common in hill-country throughout much of New Zealand during the breeding season. Redpolls are frequently seen in flocks interspersed with other finches in the lowlands in winter. They feed mainly on a range of smaller seeds. These are frequently taken while hanging upside-down from seed heads or the cones of trees such as birch and alder.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Redpolls are the smallest of New Zealand&#x2019;s introduced finches. They are brownish and streaked, and both sexes have the red crown patch. Adult males have a variable amount of pink on the lower throat and breast. This only appears after the bird&#x2019;s second moult, so first-year males are indistinguishable from females in the field. Some adult females and first-year males may have a slight pink flush on the breast, but this is not normally visible in the field. Juveniles are similar to the adult female, but are paler and lack any red colouration on the crown.</p>\n<p>Voice: redpolls have a distinctive flight call: <em>chich-chich-chich</em>. Variations of a <em>tsooee</em> call are uttered either as an alarm call or as a contact call while perched.</p>\n<p>Similar species: from a distance, the redpoll could be confused with a female house sparrow, which is similarly streaked. However, the sparrow is a larger bird with a heavier bill, and it also lacks any red or pink in its plumage.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The redpoll is widespread throughout the South Island, and is also found on many off-shore islands. In the North Island, it is found in all regions, but is generally less abundant than in the South Island. The redpoll has colonised many outlying islands; it is a common resident on&#xA0;the Chatham Islands, and Campbell and Macquarie Islands. Smaller numbers are present on Snares, Antipodes and Auckland Islands, and it has been recorded as a vagrant on the Kermadecs and Lord Howe Islands. Single birds were recorded on the Bounty Islands in December 1990, and in Vanuatu in 1992.</p>\n<p>The natural range of the common redpoll is North America, Greenland, Iceland and Eurasia from Britain east to Japan.</p>\n<p>In New Zealand, redpolls occur in all types of open country from sea-level to 1500 m, including rough scrubby farmland and tussock grassland. They also inhabit forest and shrubland, but generally in clearings. Redpolls frequent gardens, parks, golf courses, croplands and orchards, especially outside the breeding season.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Redpolls are fairly common, especially at higher elevations in the South Island. They are also common on the Chatham Islands, and Campbell and Macquarie Islands; with lower numbers present on other outlying islands. However, there seems to have been a decline in the abundance of this species in recent years, especially in parts of the North Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>There are no reported ecological impacts caused by redpolls. They may cause economic losses to orchardists, and are considered a pest in some fruit-growing districts of the South Island, especially Central Otago. Damage to the buds of a variety of fruit trees has been reported during a short period in early spring. Strawberries may be damaged as a result of the birds pecking the seeds from the fruit. Redpolls may also eat newly-sown grass seed.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Redpolls breed from mid-October until the end of March, usually producing two clutches per year. They are monogamous during the breeding season, with males defending a poorly-defined territory. The female builds a small, neat cup-shaped nest of fine grass and twigs, lined with hair and feathers. The male feeds his mate while she incubates the clutch of three to six (typically four) eggs. When these hatch, both parents feed the chicks by regurgitation until fledging, and for approximately two weeks afterwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Redpolls feed on the ground or from weeds growing near the ground, and also amongst the branches and foliage of shrubs and trees. They frequently perform acrobatic acts to reach seeds located near the tips of thin twigs.</p>\n<p>During the breeding season, the redpoll is most often observed either as single individuals or in pairs. Small groups of juveniles or mixed groups of adults and juveniles may feed together. They are gregarious during the non-breeding period, when they may gather into large flocks of hundreds or even thousands of birds. One flock was estimated to contain more than 100,000 birds. The composition of the flocks may vary; age and sex proportions changing according to the time of year. Redpolls may form mixed flocks with other species of finches and yellowhammers at a good food source.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence of regular internal migration, but local movements occur in response to seasonal food availability. There is an altitudinal component in many of the movements, as many birds breed in high country which they vacate during winter when there is little food available. Movements are often irregular, and birds have reached many outlying islands unaided.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>The redpoll feeds mainly on seeds, gleaned from a variety of weeds, shrubs and trees. These include the seeds of grasses (especially <em>Poa annua </em>and toetoe<em>)</em>, rushes, dock, dandelion, and annual weeds such as fat hen and <em>Amaranthus</em>. A variety of tree seeds including those of birch and alder are taken. Small insects such as aphids form a minor part of the diet, eaten mainly during the breeding season. Buds are also consumed, most frequently in late winter and early spring when preferred food sources are not available.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/redpoll.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/redpoll.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redpoll\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redpoll</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.

Yellowhammers are present on many offshore islands, from the Three Kings in the north to islets off Stewart Island in the south. They also breeds on the Kermadec Islands. Their status on the Chatham Islands is unclear (either a rare breeding species or vagrant from mainland New Zealand). Vagrants have been reported from Snares, Antipodes, Auckland, Campbell and Lord Howe Islands.</p>\n<p>The natural breeding range of the yellowhammer is Eurasia, extending from Britain east to Siberia and south to the Mediterranean Sea. Many birds from northern populations winter in North Africa, the Middle East and southern Asia.</p>\n<p>The yellowhammer is a bird of open country. This includes farmland with ditches and hedgerows, pasture with patches of scrub and trees, stubble fields and weed-infested crops. It can also frequently be seen in city gardens and parks outside the breeding season, especially in places where there is newly-sown grass seed. They are common in coastal habitats, and also inhabit tussock grassland, though seldom in alpine areas. It is found mostly from sea-level up to 600 m, occasionally up to 1600 m.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Yellowhammers are common and widespread in open country throughout much of the mainland. They are uncommon (possibly vagrant) on the Chatham Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The clearance of native forests benefited this species greatly. It was considered a pest in the early 20th Century when pasture was being established on newly-cleared farmland. This was due to its habit of feeding on the newly-sown seeds. Around this time it also caused a considerable amount of damage to grain crops. As a result of this damage, a bounty was placed on the heads of yellowhammers, and their eggs. Flocks may still cause much loss of newly-sown grass seed on lawns and playing fields and in parks.</p>\n<p>Yellowhammers do not appear to be a major competitor with any native species. Their diet, consisting largely of grass seeds, does not overlap with that of any native species of open country to any great extent.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Yellowhammers are normally double-brooded, and defend a territory throughout the rather long breeding season, which stretches from October to March. The nest is usually on or close to the ground in long grass or thick shrubby vegetation. It is a loosely-constructed cup of dry grass lined with rootlets, hair or other fine fibres. The 3-5 (typically 4) eggs are pinkish-white with dark-brown scribbles and spots. They are incubated mostly by the female, and the resultant chicks are fed by both parents mainly on invertebrates for 12-13 days, and for about a further 3 weeks after fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Yellowhammers spend most of their time on the ground, on pasture, ploughed land, crops and stubble, and also on lawns and in gardens. They are monogamous in the breeding season, but congregate in flocks ranging in size from several individuals to more than a thousand birds outside this period. They are often in mixed flocks with other species, including chaffinch, greenfinch, goldfinch, house sparrow and cirl bunting, especially at a good food source. Males sing from a conspicuous perch during breeding e.g. on a treetop or power line. During the breeding season, a distraction display may be performed if the nest is disturbed.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence that yellowhammers migrate within New Zealand; however there may be some seasonal altitudinal movement. They regularly cross open water, as birds have reached many outlying islands unaided.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Yellowhammers feed mostly on seeds, especially those of grasses. Barley grass, ryegrass and <em>Poa annua</em> seeds are commonly consumed, also those of chickweed, dandelion and <em>Amaranthus</em>. Invertebrates are an important food source, especially in the breeding season. These include grasshoppers, moths, caterpillars, flies, beetles, aphids, bugs, cicadas and spiders. The chicks are largely fed on invertebrates, especially before fledging.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowhammer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowhammer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/yellowhammer.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/yellowhammer.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Heather, B.D.; Robertson, H.

They are only found in the North Island where they inhabit mostly the canopy regions of tall dense forest. Their numbers have been in decline but relocations in recent years have seen some very good results with several newly established populations. Whiteheads are the only North Island hosts for the long-tailed cuckoo.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">Whiteheads are small songbirds with a compact body, short tail and bill and long legs. The head and underparts are white or whitish. Upperparts, wings and tail are brown-grey. Bill, legs and eyes are dark.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">Voice: whitehead song is a characteristic <em>viu viu viu zir zir zir zir</em> or canary-like twitter. Several other chirps or chatters are used for constant communication within the group.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">Similar species: although some species such as sparrow and silvereye are similar in size, the distinct white head and underparts make the whitehead easily distinguishable from other small passerines.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">The whitehead occurs only in the North Island of New Zealand. Its mainland distribution is south of a line connecting the Pirongia Forest, Hamilton and Te Aroha. It is locally common though patchily distributed south of this line, and to the north is limited to offshore islands and one fenced translocation site. Whiteheads are naturally common on Little Barrier and Kapiti Islands, and have been successfully introduced to Tiritiri Matangi Island, Motuora Island and Tawharanui Regional Park in the Auckland area, plus Maungatautari, Mana Island and Karori Sanctuary. Attempts to establish whiteheads in the Waitakere ranges (Ark in the Park) and at Cape Sanctuary (Hawke&#x2019;s Bay) are continuing, and in 2011 or 2012 they were released on Moturoa Island (Bay of Islands) and Motuihe, Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands in the Hauraki Gulf.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">Although found most commonly in tall native forest and dense shrubland, whiteheads also occur in mature pine plantations.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">Whiteheads are abundant on some pest-free offshore islands and mainland sites where predatory mammals are effectively controlled or excluded. They can be among the most abundant forest birds present at these sites (e.g. on Kapiti and Little Barrier Islands).</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><strong>Threats and conservation </strong></p>\n<p>In the past, whitehead numbers declined dramatically due to forest clearance and predation by introduced mammals (particularly ship rats and stoats). They are reluctant flyers that do not often cross open ground, and so are very vulnerable to habitat fragmentation, as local populations that die out cannot be replenished. In the late 1800s, whiteheads disappeared from the northern North Island including many offshore islands in the Hauraki Gulf. They survived on Little Barrier and Kapiti Islands and these two populations have been used as source populations for numerous translocations.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">Whiteheads produce a single clutch per season from October to January. Nests are tightly woven, neat cups lined with fine materials such as natural fibres or moss. They are usually built in tree forks, hidden in dense canopy vegetation. Clutches usually contain 3 eggs, laid on consecutive days by the primary female. The female is also the sole incubator. The primary male or helpers may feed her as well as her young, both on and off the nest. Whiteheads are very inconspicuous around their nest which makes nests hard to find. Incubation takes about 18 days, and the chicks leave the nest when 16-19 days old.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">Whiteheads are host to the brood-parasitic long-tailed cuckoo. The cuckoo lays her egg into the whitehead&#x2019;s nest, and the whitehead incubates it along with her own eggs. After the cuckoo chick hatches, it ejects whitehead eggs and/or chicks from the nest and is raised by itself.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">During the breeding season, whiteheads form very vocal, sedentary groups. These groups may break up or disperse to increase their foraging areas during the non-breeding season, when they can also be seen foraging in mixed-species flocks. Whiteheads are reluctant fliers but they move quickly through the canopy and are acrobatic when foraging, often hanging upside down.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Standard\">Whiteheads consume insects (especially caterpillars and beetles) and spiders, and sometimes take fruit or other plant material.</p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><strong>Weblinks </strong></p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_(bird)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_(bird)</a></p>\n<p class=\"Standard\"><a href=\"http://nzbirds.com/birds/whitehead.html\">http://nzbirds.com/birds/whitehead.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"Standard\">Gill, B. 1990.

They were once one of the most common and conspicuous birds of South and Stewart Island forests, but have been gradually declining since the arrival of ship rats and stoats in New Zealand. Since the 1970s their range contraction has been dramatic, with many of the small scattered populations disappearing. Today they remain common in beech forests in parts of the Catlins, the Blue Mountains, the Dart and Landsborough Valleys, with scattered small populations in eastern Fiordland, west Otago and a small remnant population in North Canterbury. They have been introduced to several predator-free southern islands where they have mostly flourished.</p>\n<p>Yellowhead are closely related to the brown creeper and whitehead, and all three species are the preferred hosts of the long-tailed cuckoo.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The yellowhead is a small, forest-dwelling songbird with a conspicuous yellow head and breast, brown back, wings and tail and a white lower belly and vent. The end of the tail is tattered and spiky when worn. The bill and legs are black.</p>\n<p>Voice: a characteristic machine-gun like chatter made by both sexes, and an often musical song made by males which varies from place to place. Females make a distinctive descending buzzing call.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the only yellow-headed bird with which they might be confused are male yellowhammers, but yellowheads never leave the forest, and yellowhammers never enter it. Their calls can sometimes be confused with those of brown creeper.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Yellowheads were previously found in all forests in the South and Stewart Island from sea level to the tree line, but since at least the 1960s they have become confined to beech forest, and there has been a recent dramatic contraction in range. Yellowheads are now found in beech forests in Fiordland, the Catlins, Blue Mountains, some valleys in west Otago, the Landsborough Valley and the Hawdon and Hurunui Valleys in Canterbury. They are common only in the Catlins, Blue Mountains, Dart and Landsborough Valleys. Yellowheads have been introduced to Nukuwaiata Island in the Marlborough Sounds, Breaksea, Anchor, Pigeon, Secretary, Resolution, Chalky and Pomona Islands in Fiordland, Pigeon Island (Wawahi-Waka) in Lake Wakatipu, and Codfish and Ulva Islands off Stewart Island.</p>\n<p>Where they still occur, yellowheads are most common in tall red and silver beech forest.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>With the exception of Nukuwaiata, yellowheads are common on the islands that they have been introduced to, and are still common in the parts of the Catlins, Blue Mountains, Dart and Landsborough Valleys. Elsewhere scattered pairs remain. The total population is probably of the order of 5000 birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>Yellowheads are preyed on by stoats and rats, particularly while they are nesting and roosting in holes. In higher altitude beech forests their populations do well in most years, but in years following heavy beech seeding high numbers of rats and stoats often decimate populations. At low altitudes continuously high numbers of rats and stoats quickly eliminated yellowheads and they only survive at low altitudes on predator-free islands. Yellowhead populations thrive with effective stoat and rat control.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Yellowheads breed in spring and summer, mostly as monogamous pairs, but with helpers at some nests. A woven, feather-lined cup of fibrous material is built in a cavity in a tree, between 0 and 31 m off the ground. Clutch size 1-4. Only females incubate, which takes 20-21 days. Both sexes feed the young, which leave the nest after 18-22 days, and are fed intensively for a few more weeks, and occasionally for up to 9 months. Some nests are parasitised by long-tailed cuckoos.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Yellowheads spend most of their time high in trees gleaning invertebrates from foliage, or searching for invertebrates by scratching amongst accumulated litter in the crooks of branches, or scratching loose bark mosses and ferns on the trunks of trees. They often scratch with one leg whilst hanging onto a tree trunk with the other leg and using their tail as an extra prop (hence the spiky tail). They are often detected by the rain of litter they dislodge. They flit agilely from branch to branch but are surprisingly poor fliers when moving more than a few metres. During their breeding season they forage in family groups comprising a pair, sometimes one or two helpers and any chicks of the year. In the autumn and winter they move around in much larger groups often with yellow-crowned parakeets and fantails in attendance.</p>\n<p>Because they mostly forage high in trees they are most often detected by their calls, particularly the chatter and male song.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Yellowheads consume invertebrates especially caterpillars and spiders.

Often the first sign is a large chattering flock high in the forest canopy. They can be attracted down by squeaking or pishing, but do not stay long as the flock moves on through the canopy. Once sighted the grey face and buff underparts are distinctive.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The brown creeper is a small, noisy flocking songbird found in forest and shrubland in the South Island and Stewart Island. It has ash- to dark-grey on the face, sharply demarcated from the light buff underparts. The crown, back, rump and tail are dark reddish brown, with a dark bar on the tip of the tail. The eye is reddish-brown and the bill, legs and feet are pinkish- or grey-brown. The sexes are alike and juveniles are similar.</p>\n<p>Voice: harsh chattering contact calls, often by many birds in a flock, also canary-like song. Both the contact call and song can be confused with the related yellowhead where both species occur.</p>\n<p>Similar species: dunnock is darker underneath and is more furtive, often close to or on the ground. Grey warbler is smaller, rarely occurs in groups larger than a pair, and does not have the sharp demarcation between grey on the face and pale underparts.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Brown creepers occur throughout the South and Stewart Islands. It is present on some islands in the Marlborough Sounds (e.g. D&#x2019;Urville, Arapawa and Maud Islands), Fiordland (including Secretary, Resolution and Chalky Islands) and a few islands off Stewart Island (Codfish, Ulva and north-east muttonbird islands). Isolated populations are present on Banks Peninsula, Mt Peel and the Hunters Hills, and they persist at other sites that appear isolated from main populations (e.g. Naseby, Central Otago, and coastal Otago centred on Dunedin).</p>\n<p>Brown creepers inhabit a wide range of forest types, from sea level to the tree-line, including tall beech and podocarp forests, manuka/kanuka and other scrub forests, muttonbird scrub, regrowing forest, mature pine forests, willow, gorse and broom.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Brown creepers are common through most of their range. In the nonbreeding season they may form flocks of up to 60 individuals and associate with yellowheads and parakeets. They disappeared from large areas of the eastern South Island following forest clearance, but numbers and distribution now appear stable.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Nesting can begin in September and extend through to early February, with egg-laying from late September to late January. Brown creeper can make up to four nesting attempts in a season but will only raise two broods. Laying peaks in early October, with a second peak in late November indicating renesting attempts. The female builds a compact deep cup of vegetative material including bark, twigs, moss and leaves. It is lined with dried grass, feathers and wool. Nests are found in dense patches of foliage in the forest canopy, sometimes in shrubs or low trees 1-10 m above the ground. Males closely attend females during nest building and the start of laying. The clutch is 2-4 (typically 3) eggs laid at 24 hour intervals. The female alone incubates&#xA0;for 17-21 days and&#xA0;broods the young, but both adults feed the chicks which fledge at 18-22 days. When renesting occurs the male takes over most feeding with some assistance from non-breeding birds.</p>\n<p>Brown creepers pairs are monogamous and exhibit high mate fidelity, with 64.7% staying together for two seasons and 29.4 % for three seasons; changes in pairs were precipitated by loss of the partner rather than divorce and mate swapping. In drought condition there have been reports of cooperative breeding with failed adults contributing food to a nest. The young of the year stay as a group once they become independent and often form larger groups through the autumn and winter. 63% of eggs hatch and 36% fledge. Predation accounted for 62% of eggs and 66% of nestlings lost, with an overall success rate of 1.6 fledglings/adult/year. Brown creepers can breed at one year old.</p>\n<p>Brown creepers are the primary host for the long-tailed cuckoo in the South Island and Stewart Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Pairs defend territories during the breeding season and to a lesser extent during the rest of the year. Brown creepers are gregarious during autumn and winter, forming large flocks, often with other species (including silvereye, parakeet, grey warbler and fantail). At Kaikoura brown creeper formed the nucleus of mixed feeding flocks. They are non-migratory, but birds in high altitude forests will descend to lower altitudes in winter. Brown creepers mob long-tailed cuckoos when they are present in spring and summer.</p>\n<p>Brown creepers are vocal all day and all year except during the late summer moult.&#xA0;Males give territorial song which varies from bird to bird and is a phrase of slurs notes and whisltes. Females sing a rapid sequence of brief notes. Calls include a wide range of chatters, trills and &#x2018;zicks&#x2019;. In autumn and winter large flocks will call incessantly whereas small flocks will have periods of silence. They respond readily to &#x201C;squeaking&#x201D; and will closely investigate but then the flock will continue to move through the canopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Brown creepers are insectivorous, but take some fruit. Their main prey are beetles, spiders, moths and caterpillars. They glean invertebrates from leaves and small branches in the canopy, and occasionally will glean from loose bark on main trunks and large branches, and will hang upside down to forage. Brown creepers rarely feed on the ground, with most foraging occurring from 2 m off the ground through to the canopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ebird.org/ebird/newzealand/map/pipipi1?neg=true&amp;env.minX=&amp;env.minY=&amp;env.maxX=&amp;env.maxY=&amp;zh=false&amp;gp=false&amp;mr=1-12&amp;bmo=1&amp;emo=12&amp;yr=1900-2012&amp;byr=1900&amp;eyr=2012\">eBird Brown creeper</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p class=\"Standard\">Aidala, Z.; Chong, N.; Anderson, M.G.; Ortiz-Catedral, L.; Jamieson, I.G.; Briskie, J.V.; Cassey, P.; Gill, B.J.; Hauber, M.E. 2013.

The male takes several years to attain full adult plumage; after the second moult it resembles an adult female. Some white appears on the mantle after the third moult, and the remainder after the fourth moult. The juvenile is mottled grey on the under-surface. The black-backed magpie is similar to the white-backed forms, but with a black mantle. The female can be identified by the presence of some grey on the lower hind-neck.

It is uncommon in Nelson and inland Marlborough, and is largely absent from Westland, except for the area between Harihari and Westport. The white-backed forms predominate except in Hawke&#x2019;s Bay and North Canterbury, where black-backed birds make up around 95% of the population.</p>\n<p>The white-backed forms originate from south-eastern Australia and Tasmania, and the black-backed from northern Australia and southern New Guinea.

They inhabit both lowland and hill-country farming districts, and are frequently found in urban habitats such as parks and golf-courses.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>Australian magpies are common in much of the North Island and the east of the South Island south of Kaikoura. They have declined in some areas, e.g. Wellington, as a result of control programmes.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological and economic impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The Australian magpie has been widely implicated in the predation of native birds and their nests, but much evidence is anecdotal. However, magpies do occasionally kill other birds, mostly smaller species. One was seen to pursue, capture and kill a juvenile goldfinch, and another took 3 newly-hatched banded dotterel chicks from a nest. Most attacks appear to be opportunistic, involving young or weak victims. Many of the attacks by magpies against larger birds are directed towards harriers, and generally cease when the target leaves the territory. This harassment of harriers may even have a protective effect on other species breeding in a magpie&#x2019;s territory.</p>\n<p>A study in the Waikato whereby nests of a range of species were monitored by cameras revealed only one instance of magpie predation. The vast majority of predation events involved mammalian predators or harriers. The conclusion reached was that magpies were not an important predator of the nests of rural birds. Likewise a study by several regional councils and Landcare Research found little evidence that magpies affected the populations of other species of birds. Magpies were removed from a number of blocks of land, and other blocks were left untouched as controls. The bird species were surveyed before commencement of control in the &#x201C;kill&#x201D; blocks, and then again after the operations had been completed. Little change in numbers of other species was found afterwards, or in comparison with the populations in the control blocks. However the visibility of other species was affected; without magpies some were more frequently seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>Magpies breed early, commencing nest-building in late July, and are normally single brooded. The bulky nest is built of twigs, roots, and man-made materials including wire, and lined with hair and wool. It is usually located in the crown or side-branches of tall trees, especially pines, macrocarpas and gums. Native trees such as tawa and beech are also frequently used. The usual clutch consists of 3-4 eggs, and the resulting chicks are fed by both parents for 4-5 weeks until fledging. They rely on their parents for a further 2 months or so afterwards. Usually only one or two chicks survive, as in most cases it takes one parent per chick to provide sufficient food.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Magpies have a complex social organisation; pairs or groups defend a territory year round. New Zealand groups seem to consist mainly of single pairs, or pairs with young from the previous season. In most cases juveniles remain with their parents until the winter, but are evicted before the onset of the next breeding season. Other groups consist of a varying number of adult birds, some of which may be previous offspring which have been allowed to remain. Usually only one female breeds successfully. Non-territorial flocks consist of evicted juveniles and sub-adults, numbering up to 80 or more individuals.</p>\n<p>Magpies are well-known for their propensity for attacking people by dive-bombing during the breeding season. However, this usually only lasts until shortly after the chicks fledge. Also, as anyone who has kept a pet magpie will attest, they can be playful, especially when young. This often involves rolling on the ground on their backs with their siblings and occasionally also with their parents, in a similar manner to that practised by keas. Various objects may be used as playthings.</p>\n<p><strong>Food </strong></p>\n<p>Australian magpies mainly feed on invertebrates, taken mostly from the ground. A large proportion of the diet consists of earthworms in winter, but at other times of the year they feed mainly on insects, including pest species. They particularly favour the caterpillars of the porina moth, which are extracted from their tunnels in the ground. Other invertebrates eaten include army worm caterpillars, crickets, wasps, spiders, stick insects and snails. In late summer magpies frequently feed on large cicadas when these are available. As with owls, they eject pellets consisting of the hard parts of these insects. Occasionally magpies consume carrion, lizards, mice, small birds and their eggs and chicks. Seeds and grain may be taken occasionally.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Magpie\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Magpie</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpies_in_New_Zealand\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpies_in_New_Zealand</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/australian-magpie-cracticus-tibicen\">http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/australian-magpie-cracticus-tibicen</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Crossland, A.C. 2008.

Two of the Australian species also occur in south-east Asia and Melanesia. The remaining species range from south-east Asia into southern China, and across to Indian and Sri Lanka. They are often put in the same family as butcherbirds, currawongs and the Australian magpie. Two of the Australian species &#x2013; white-browed woodswallow and masked woodswallow &#x2013; are highly nomadic, often occurring together in mixed flocks. Not surprisingly perhaps, these are the species that have occurred as vagrants in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The masked woodswallow is a partly sexually dimorphic species, with the male&#x2019;s plumage pattern being more accentuated than the female&#x2019;s. The male has a black face and throat forming a distinct mask, edged with a white crescent at the rear. The crown, upperparts and tail are mid grey, with off-white tips to the tail feathers forming a pale terminal band apparent in flight when seen both from above and below. The underparts, including the under surface of the tail, are pale grey to off-white, faintly tinged pink. The wings and wing coverts are grey, with the primaries being darker. The wing coverts have&#xA0;thin pale edges, creating a faintly scaled look. Iris is dark brown; bill blue-grey with a black tip, as in other woodswallows. Females are similar but the facial mask is grey with only a faint pale crescent at the rear. Upperparts are slightly darker grey, tinged with brown; underparts pale-grey, also tinged brown. Juveniles are pale brown with darker grey-brown back feathers and wing coverts; pale fawn edges to both create a spotted and speckled appearance. The underparts are flecked brown, with faint barring towards the flanks. Juveniles have only an indistinct pale grey-brown facial mask, which becomes slightly more apparent in immature plumage. This is similar to a female&#x2019;s plumage but still with some pale edges to the wing coverts and nape. Young birds have pale brown bills, dark only at the very tip. Like other woodswallows, masked woodswallows have powder-down feathers, the tips of which disintegrate to form a fine powder that the birds use when grooming.</p>\n<p>Voice: the call is a brief <em>chirt</em>, rising slightly at the end; this is interspersed with a quiet chatter of <em>whee whee</em> and buzzing notes.</p>\n<p>Similar species: at first glance could be confused with black-faced cuckoo-shrike, <em>Coracina novaehollandiae</em>, another rare vagrant from Australia, but that species is distinctly larger (33 cm), lacks the white crescent at the rear edge of its black facial mask, and has a tapered rather than square tail, which lacks a pale terminal band. The flight of the cuckoo-shrike is also different, being slow and undulating, always from tree to tree, in contrast to the woodswallow&#x2019;s faster and more angular sallies into the air, the bird often returning to the same perch.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>The masked woodswallow is endemic to Australia. It is widespread and common in arid shrubland, woodland and adjacent farmland across south-eastern Australia, extending to some central areas and in Western Australia, but can be locally irregular within this range. It is absent from the extreme north, the Cape York peninsula, the east and south-east coastal regions, and Tasmania, where it is recorded only as a vagrant, as in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>A pair of masked woodswallows was present in Naseby Forest, Central Otago, from January 1972 to August 1973, in the company of four white-browed woodswallows. This pair bred and produced two chicks, but their nest was never found. The young birds disappeared in early June 1973, whereas the adults disappeared in late July and early August 1973 respectively, both after severe cold spells. In October 2006, a recently-dead bird was found on a bush track at Otatara, Invercargill. That specimen is now in the Museum of New Zealand/Te Papa Tongarewa.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>The masked woodswallow is a nomadic species. It is usually seen in pairs or small groups, but can form bigger flocks when wandering. When in family or larger groups, the birds are highly sociable, often perching and roosting close together, along with much chittering and allogrooming. They frequently associate with white-browed woodswallows, the other highly nomadic woodswallow species in Australia. Although over 500 masked woodswallows have been banded in Australia, only two have been recovered, both of them soon after and close to where they were originally banded.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Masked woodswallows feed mostly on insects, usually taken on the wing by birds sallying out from a perch to intercept insects flying by, or hawking insects. Adults also drink nectar.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVpgt7kugw\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVpgt7kugw</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1&amp;v=UgXwPA7EXe4\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1&amp;v=UgXwPA7EXe4</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Woodswallow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Woodswallow</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=5863\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=5863</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Child, P. 1974.

There is an unconfirmed sighting of two dusky woodswallows (<em>A. cyanopterus</em>) hawking insects over Ho Ho Bay, Snares Island, in October 1983.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The white-browed woodswallow is a sexually dimorphic species, with the male being slightly larger and more brightly coloured than the female. Males have dark grey upperparts, upper breast and chin. The crown, face and throat are darker grey, broken only by a distinct white stripe above the eye. The lower breast, belly and undertail coverts are brick red. The tail is grey above and paler below, with distinct white tips, broader and more prominent towards the outer tail. The wings are grey above and off-white below. Females are generally duller and paler than males, with bleached salmon red underparts, brownish grey upperparts, and a less prominent white eyebrow. Adults of both sexes have dark brown irises, and a pale blue-grey bill with black tip. Juveniles and immature birds are duller and browner than adults, streaked below, and speckled above, an effect created by the pale edges of the back feathers and wing coverts.

It is most common within the Murray-Darling Basin, inhabiting eucalypt forests and woodlands, mallee shrubland, and spinifex-dominated rangelands, as well as farmlands, orchards and sometimes towns. Outside the breeding season, the birds are highly nomadic, ranging across inland Australia, following rain-producing fronts. Some move northwards in winter to the Northern Territory and central Queensland, returning southwards in spring to nest. In drought years, birds often reach coastal south-east Australia. Vagrants ending up in New Zealand may have been birds that overshot the coast and were then carried eastwards by westerly winds.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong><strong> records</strong></p>\n<p>Four white-browed woodswallows were present in Naseby Forest, Central Otago, December 1971 to July 1973, in the company of a pair of masked woodswallows (which bred and reared two chicks during this period). Three of the white-browed woodswallows are thought to have succumbed during a series of cold spells experienced in July 1973; the fourth died earlier and that specimen is in the Otago Museum. Another bird was recorded at Miranda, Firth of Thames, in September 1991, following the passage of a series of fronts from Australia. One other record, from central Waikato in February 2002, was never submitted for verification.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>In Australia, white-browed woodswallows are usually seen in loose colonies or isolated pairs during the spring breeding season. They occasionally nest in mixed colonies with masked woodswallows. White-browed woodswallows are highly sociable, with birds often perched close together, neighbours sometimes preening each other. During migration and on their wintering grounds they generally occur in bigger flocks, again often with masked woodswallows.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>White-browed woodswallows feed largely on flying insects, which they pursue by hawking or sallying from exposed perches, but they will also pounce on insects visible on the ground. Like other woodswallows, they have brush-tipped tongues, a feature that helps them feed on nectar.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlzGW9lK7Zw\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlzGW9lK7Zw</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.birdforum.net/opus/Artamus_superciliosus\">http://www.birdforum.net/opus/Artamus_superciliosus</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Child, P. 1974.

It is a common summer migrant to Tasmania. A second population occurs in south-west Western Australia. </p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>A single bird photographed near Halfmoon Bay on Stewart Island in late September 2014 is the sole accepted New Zealand record.&#xA0;There was an unconfirmed sighting of two dusky woodswallows hawking insects over Ho Ho Bay, Snares Islands, in October 1983. The timing of these&#xA0;sightings coincides with the southward migration of adult dusky woodswallows across Bass Strait to Tasmania. </p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Dusky woodswallows are gregarious and largely migratory in the south-east of their range. They are noisy and conspicuous, usually occurring in pairs or small groups, but can form larger flocks in association with other woodswallow species. They often roost in flocks of 20 or more, and may cluster together in cold weather. When perched, they often fan and twist the tail, especially just after landing or if agitated.</p>\n<p>Dusky woodswallows often breed in co-operative groups, and nests may be in close proximity. The nest, which is placed in a tree fork or stump, or in a fence post, is an untidy bowl of twigs, grass and roots, lined with fine grass. Both parents build the nest, incubate the 3-4 eggs, and feed the young.</p>\n<p>Although over 2500 dusky woodswallows have been banded in Australia, banding has failed to reveal migratory movements, with all recoveries being within 10 km of the banding location. The oldest bird recorded was banded as an adult and recaptured 8 years later. Like other woodswallows, dusky woodswallows have powder-down feathers, the tips of which disintegrate to form a fine powder that the birds use when grooming.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Dusky woodswallows feed mostly on insects, usually taken on the wing by birds sallying out from a perch to intercept flying insects in rapid, graceful flight. Invertebrates are also taken from the ground, and they occasionally feed on nectar and fruit.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fRm2D3hi60\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fRm2D3hi60</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusky_woodswallow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusky_woodswallow</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=20835\">http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=20835</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2015/03/02/a-new-bird-for-new-zealand-dusky-woodswallow/\">A new bird for New Zealand &#x2013; dusky woodswallow</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Kakishima%20%26%20Morimoto%202015.pdf\">Kakishima, S.; Morimoto, T. 2015.

Its wide distribution and habitat preferences, including frequenting well-treed urban parks and gardens, means that most people encounter fantails occasionally. They can be quite confiding, continuing to nest build or visit their nestlings with food when people watch quietly. There are two colour forms or &#x2018;morphs&#x2019; of fantail, with the more common pied morph occurring throughout its range, and the black morph comprising up to 5% of the South Island population, and occasionally occurring in the North Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand fantail occurs in two colour morphs: pied and black. The adult pied fantail has a greyish head, prominent white eyebrows, brown back and rump, cinnamon breast and belly, white and black bands across the upper breast, and a long black and white tail. Juvenile pied fantails are of mainly brown tones over the head and body, lack the striking&#xA0;white eyebrows and chest bands, and&#xA0;are more rufous on the breast, eyebrows and&#xA0;on the tips of the primary coverts than adults. Black fantails are mainly black, with black-brown over the rump, belly and flight feathers, and occasionally have a white spot over each ear. Note that black morph fantails never have white on their tail feathers. Juvenile black fantails tend to be more dark brown than black. Black fantails are rare in the North Island, and make up less than 5% of individuals across the South Island. The main difference between the subspecies is the amount of white in the tail (North Island fantail with slightly greyish inner webs, South Island pied morph white inner webs, Chatham Island fantail with more extensive white). Fantails are occasionally seen without tails!&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Voice: fantails are quite vocal, except when it is particularly cold. They regularly give &#x2018;cheep&#x2019; calls in a number of situations, such as when foraging or alarmed. The species&#x2019; distinctive song has been described as &#x201C;a chattering <em>tweeta-tweeta-tweeta</em>&#x2026;. of regular rhythm&#x201D;, and of high pitch. It can be heard throughout the year, particularly during the breeding season (August-March), but least of all during cold, wet days of winter.</p>\n<p>Similar species: the New Zealand fantail is the only resident fantail in New Zealand and so is unlikely to be confused with any other species. The related willie wagtail has reached New Zealand on one occasion.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Fantails occur widely from Northland to Stewart Island, and on some islands of the Chathams group (Chatham, Pitt, Rangatira, Mangere, Little Mangere). They colonised the Snares group during 1977-81, but disappeared during a severe storm in 2001.</p>\n<p>The widespread distribution of the fantail can be attributed to its utilisation of a wide variety of habitats, including both native and exotic forest and shrubland habitats. It is widespread in extensive native forest blocks, small forest patches, scrubland, exotic plantations, farm shelterbelts, orchards, and well-treed suburban parks and gardens.</p>\n<p><strong>Population</strong></p>\n<p>The New Zealand fantail is widespread and can be locally common, especially following the breeding season when small flocks form. However, local populations and those on small islands can disappear or reduce in numbers dramatically during prolonged cold and wet weather. In line with population declines in severe weather, fantails tend to be scarce or non-existent in open country that experiences extreme frosts and snow, such as inland Marlborough and central Otago. In suitable habitat, populations usually recover within a year or two due to the species&#x2019; high breeding productivity and extensive juvenile dispersal.</p>\n<p><strong>Threats and conservation</strong></p>\n<p>The fantail is one of the few native forest bird species that has coped reasonably well with the extensive conversion of lowland native forest to farmland. However, nesting adults, eggs and chicks are not immune from being preyed upon by introduced mammalian pests, particularly by ship rats.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeding</strong></p>\n<p>The timing of fantail breeding varies with location and weather conditions. Those at southern localities (Southland) and offshore islands (Chathams) have shorter breeding seasons than those further north. The nest is constructed of fine materials (mosses, dried rotten wood fibres, hair, dried grasses, fern scales) tightly woven with cobwebs. Most nests are sheltered from above by foliage, and often include a &#x2018;tail&#x2019; of material below the base of the nest. Two to five eggs are laid, with both adults taking turns on the nest through the approximately 14-day incubation period. Likewise, both male and female brood and feed the young during the approximately 14-day nestling period. Recent fledglings have short tails and often remain together, often perched side by side. The male looks after the fledglings when the female starts building the next nest. One monitored pair reared five broods in a season, totalling 15 fledglings.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>During the breeding season fantails are territorial, chasing interlopers away with harsh chattering calls. While adults remain on or near their territories in the non-breeding season, juveniles occasionally gather in loose flocks where prey is readily available. During fine, warm weather fantails forage from the understorey to the canopy, and even above the canopy. They can often be found associating with flocks of other forest species, such as brown creepers, whiteheads and silvereyes, perching below ready to intercept any prey that falls. They have a strong association with foraging saddlebacks wherever the two species co-occur. When searching for prey in foliage, fantails often flick their wings and fan their tails, presumably to frighten hidden prey into movement so that they can be detected. During cold spells in winter they can be seen moving about on the ground in search of food. Given their small size and vulnerability to cold weather, it is not surprising that they occasionally roost communally, perched tightly together in a sheltered cavity, including inside sheds and garages.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Fantails mainly eat small invertebrates, such as moths, flies, beetles and spiders. Large prey is subdued by being held in a foot against a perch and then being repeatedly pecked. Indigestible portions, such as wings, are often discarded before the remainder is eaten. Small fruit are sometimes eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Fantail\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Fantail</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/fantail-piwakawaka/\">http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/fantail-piwakawaka/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/fantail2.html\">http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/fantail2.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Atkinson, K.; Briskie, J.V. 2007.

The willie wagtail is a widespread and familiar bird in Australia. Like the fantail, the willie wagtail wags its tail from side-to-side, unlike the unrelated &#x201C;true&#x201D; wagtails, which bob their tails up-and-down. With so many diverse Australian Aboriginal languages, and no linguistic continuity across the continent, there has been little enthusiasm to adopt Aboriginal names as the standard English name for many bird species (exceptions to this include kookaburras, budgerigar, brolga and galah). Instead, early explorers likened many birds that they saw in new territories to familiar birds from their homeland. So, small red-breasted birds in Australia became &#x201C;robins&#x201D;, although unrelated to the European Robin that spawned the comparison. In the late 1970s, in an attempt to provide nomenclatural consistency throughout the world, it was suggested by some members of the ornithological community to rename the willie wagtail as willie fantail, however it never caught on, so wagtail it remains. Perhaps, with a clean slate, the willie wagtail could be called &#x201C;djidi-djidi&#x201D; (pronounced chitty-chitty), or the &#x201C;true&#x201D; wagtails could be called bobtails!</p>\n<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>\n<p>A large black fantail with a sharply demarcated white belly. It has a prominent white eyebrow which varies in size and conspicuousness depending on the bird&#x2019;s emotional state, sex or status. Like other fantails, it has prominent whiskers which protect the bird&#x2019;s eyes from flying insects and provide information about potential prey&#x2019;s location. The sexes are similar. As willie wagtails spend much time feeding on the ground, they have longer and stronger legs than other fantails.</p>\n<p>Voice: the song, often heard at night, is variously transcribed as &#x201C;sweet pretty creature&#x201D; or &#x201C;pretty little creature&#x201D;. There are also rattling and territorial chittering calls.</p>\n<p>Similar species: although unlikely to be confused with any resident New Zealand bird, males of two Australian flycatchers have similar markings: satin flycatcher (<em>Myiagra cyanoleuca</em>, recorded twice from New Zealand) and leaden flycatcher (<em>M. rubecula</em>). Both the flycatchers are smaller, slimmer birds that lack the white eyebrow and large black tail of the willie wagtail. The flycatchers are also birds of the canopy, while willie wagtails spend much time on the ground. The restless flycatcher (<em>M. inquieta</em>) is another confusion risk, but has a white chin and throat.</p>\n<p><strong>Distribution and habitat</strong></p>\n<p>Willie wagtails are&#xA0;very widespread in Australia. Some parts of the population are migratory whilst others are sedentary. It is an occasional visitor to Tasmania, although it has bred. The willie wagtail is mainly a bird of open habitats, and has adapted very successfully to human-altered environments such as gardens, parks and golf-courses. Water-courses, wetlands and other areas close to water are particularly favoured habitats. In the early 1920s, willie wagtails were introduced to Hawaii for insect control, but the venture was unsuccessful, and the population had died out by the late 1930s.</p>\n<p><strong>New Zealand records</strong></p>\n<p>The only New Zealand record of willie wagtail is from Mangere Island in the Chatham Islands, in October 1999.</p>\n<p><strong>Behaviour and ecology</strong></p>\n<p>Fearless and aggressive, the willie wagtail will take on kookaburras, ravens, magpies and even birds as large as the wedge-tailed eagle in an effort to protect its territory. Humans, domestic cats and dogs and even snake-necked tortoises and tiger snakes can also expect to feel the wrath of the agitated willie wagtail. They use livestock both as mobile perches from which to conduct aerial forays, and as ploughs disturbing food as the cattle or sheep walks along. In winter they may congregate in flocks, but mostly are seen in pairs or singly. Willie wagtails line their cup nests with fibrous material, spider-webs and on occasion with animal hair such as cat, dog, goat and alpaca.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Willie wagtails feed almost exclusively on invertebrates, mainly insects, but have also been recorded eating seeds, bread and biscuit crumbs, and goldfish. They are active and restless, feeding mainly takes place on the ground, but willie wagtails will catch insects in flight, from foliage, and from tree-trunks and branches. Like New Zealand fantails, the willie wagtail conducts food forays by flitting out and back from a perch. Movement of the wagging tail is known to flush prey, as are movements of the wings.

Five additional skeletal elements tentatively referred to this species are held at Te Papa (4) and Canterbury Museum (1).</p>\n<p>Sansom&#x2019;s plover was a small, sheathbill-like wader that was between a banded dotterel and a New Zealand dotterel in size (i.e. about 95 g). It is relatively rare in the St Bathans deposits, and the few fragments found are insufficient to deduce much about the bird&#x2019;s leg length, flying ability and ecology. Some elements found were not skeletally mature, indicating that the birds bred locally, rather than being migrants from elsewhere. The depositional environment was an inland lake, suggesting that they foraged on the lake shore.</p>\n<p>Skeletal features place Sansom&#x2019;s plover basal to a clade that includes both the sheathbills (Chionidae) of the Antarctic Peninsula and subantarctic islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and the Magellanic plover (Pluvianellidae) of South America. Although much smaller than the two species of living sheathbills, features of the coracoid in particular point to Sansom&#x2019;s plover being more similar to a sheathbill than to a Magellanic plover. However, the combination of features shared with either or both Chionidae and Pluvianellidae preclude referral to either family. All are placed within the super-family Chionoidea in the sub-order Charadrii.</p>\n<p>The mosaic of features found in Sansom&#x2019;s plover supports the split between Magellanic plover and sheathbills being more recent than 19-16 million years ago. Molecular data also indicate that the split between these two groups was among the most recent for family level divergence within Charadrii. Other examples of New Zealand faunal connections with South America include our mystacinid bats (with South American noctilionids), and <em>Coenocorypha</em> snipes (with Andean, cordilleran and imperial snipes).</p>\n<p>The genus name is after Neilus who in Greek mythology was the father of Chiona, alluding to Sansom&#x2019;s plover being basal to sheathbills in the genus <em>Chionis</em>. Neilus derives from the Greek word meaning &#x2018;river valley&#x2019; and so it also describes the site where the fossils were found. &#xA0;The species name honours Southland ornithologist Olga Sansom (1900-1989) who, along with her daughter Maida Barlow, undertook studies of shorebirds in southern New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/fossils/6/1\">http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/fossils/6/1</a></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p><p>De Pietri, V.L.; Scofield, R.P.; Hand, S.J.; Tennyson, A.J.D.; Worthy, T.H. 2016.
